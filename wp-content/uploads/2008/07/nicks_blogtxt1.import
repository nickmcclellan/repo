Greetings, and welcome to my new blog. I am Nick, and though this isn't the first incarnation of my blog (and it's certainly not the last), this is the first blog I have written in quite a while.

Last we left me, on that other Web site I used to manage, I was moving away. Well, for those who may have followed my adventures back then, you should know that I am living happily in California in the Great Central Valley in a city nessled at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I am working for a newspaper as a copy editor and page designer. My life is quite different than when I was living in Georgia and going to school.

I'm writing a blog again because I miss it. I really like having the opportunity to design a Web page and produce content for it. This blog is just a basic one and will probably change a lot over the summer. I hope to make many nifty little design innovations and what not. But for now, this will serve as a place to let out some steam.

Ok then, as I stand here calling out into the vast emptiness of the Internet yelling, "I'm back!" and the few people that actually give a damn slowly return to read my musings, I'm just going to pretend I've just been dropped into the middle of a song. No reason to make a big production out of this.

It feels good to be back :-)

Nick

He's been the source of jokes since his mysterious disappearance in 1975 -- Jimmy Hoffa. But, of course, you know where he his. He's with that sock you can't find, that jacket you misplaced or that phone number of that guy you just <em>had</em> to lose. Well, if a recent lead in the case comes to fruition, all your misplaced little trinkets will be found!

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/us/18cnd-hoffa.html?hp&ex=1148011200&en=8eb455a232e628ff&ei=5094&partner=homepage">F.B.I. Searches Michigan Farm for Remains of Hoffa</a><br>
By Micheline Maynard<br>
New York Times

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/hoffa.jpg" hspace="10" border="1">DETROIT — In the latest effort to solve a mystery that began more than 30 years ago, the Federal Bureau of Investigations said today that it was following a "fairly credible lead" that the remains of James P. Hoffa, the former Teamsters president, could be buried on a horse farm northwest of Detroit.

Using cadaver dogs borrowed from Detroit police, and aided by students and professors from Michigan State University, F.B.I. agents said they were searching an 80-acre horse farm in Milford, Mich.

Daniel D. Roberts, the special agent in charge of the Detroit F.B.I. office, said the search could take weeks.

At a news conference this afternoon on a dirt road at the entrance to the Hidden Dream Farm in Milford, Mr. Roberts said no trace of Mr. Hoffa had yet been discovered. Nor would he give details of the search warrant, which was sealed by a federal judge in Detroit.

But, Mr. Roberts said, "This is probably a fairly credible lead" in Mr. Hoffa's disappearance. Mr. Roberts, who has been in his position for the past two years, added that it was "the best lead I've come across in the Hoffa investigation."</blockquote>

I, for one, can't wait to write the headline. I mean, it practically writes itself! "They found Jimmy Hoffa!" It's a great story.

But, let's think about this. Do we really want to know the answer to all those '70's mysteries? Remember Deep Throat? The endless guessing game? It could have been anyone! Now that we know it's some spacey old man who's out for money, you gotta ask yourself, "Were we better off not knowing?"

If they find Jimmy Hoffa, what are we going to say when we lose something? "Oh, um, it's off with Amelia Earhart." That's just lame. It's going to be forever before a major public figure is killed by organized crime. I, for one, wouldn't mind switching from Hoffa to one of the Olsen twins.

I would have come up with a wittier ending, but it must have been with Ashley Olsen before they pushed her out of that 747. Such a shame...

Since I have moved out to California, I have to admit a lot of things are different than back east. Many of these are subtle, though. 

It took a few months to realize I hadn't seen a Waffle House in a while. IHOP is the trashy breakfast restaurant here. A whole new fast food restaurant, In-N-Out Burger, serves a position on the dining spectrum I had never considered (Kind of a casual Varsity, if you're curious). And Edy's ice cream, a dessert favorite to many, is mysteriously named Dreyer's. Same box, same flavor, it just says Dreyer's instead of Edy's. Weird...

Gone are supermarkets Publix, Kroger and even the Wal-Mart Supercenter (though that scorge is sure to come). I have to deal with stranger psuedonyms like Vons, Save Mart and Foods Co. It takes some getting used to, but at least I'm not shopping at the Piggly Wiggly.

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/soycrisps.jpg" border="1" hspace="10" align="right">But of all differences from back home, the most distressing would have to be the absense of some of my favorite foods. The most prominant at the moment is absense of Soy Crisps at my supermarket.

Since finally caving into vegetarianism a year and a half ago, I have adopted some peculiar tastes. I have adopted an array of new foods to keep me satisfied. Soy Crisps were first introduced to me by the sweet cashier-lady at 'Tween the Pages at the UGA library. I have been hooked on them every since, especially when my grandmother bought a bag for me each and every week during my short stint in Dayton, Ohio. Thankfully, most of my meat substitutes are served here in the Valley (minus one multi-purpose vegetarian restarant and Athens-staple), but I am down one bag of Soy Crisps.

I have searched high and low for Soy Crisps in California. After wandering around the Castro for four hours on New Year's waiting for a friend to arrive, I stumbled across some at a Safeway. It's nice to know they are in the state, but I'd rather not drive 3 hours just to silence my hunger.

Also missing is my beloved Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Bread. I have been able to get by on just wheat, but sometimes I wonder what kick PB could deliver if it were smashed between two of my expensive little cinnamon buddies.

Above all, my search for Soy Crisps is paramount. I have been getting by on Veggie Crisps (which Vons does stock), but it hasn't been easy. I just ask, if you are lucky enough to find yourself in an area pleniful in Soy Crisps, don't take them for granted. Buy a bag, maybe even two (or three, send one ot me). Enjoy them while you can. You never know when you'll be begging your local grocery manager for more.

Last Friday morning, while I was still getting over the sniffles, I considered calling in. The day before I was supposed to run 20 miles for my marathon training and I didn't want to feel miserable all day Friday just to wake up the next morning to tackle a tremendous run. As I sat there, reaching for the cell phone, one man was reason enough to jump in the shower and race off to work: Karl Rove.

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/karl.jpg" hspace="10" border="1">When I told my co-worker what had got me into work that morning, he told me that it seemed only me and a bunch of Democrats thought that stupid CIA leak story was of any interest. It got me to thinking: why am I so obsessed with the forthcoming indictment of Karl Rove? What did the Pillsbury Doughboy every do to me?

I don't really know. I never really had anything against the guy. I mean, conservatives aren't all that nasty. Granted, we have a few fundamental differences, but that doesn't mean I want all of them busted for perjury.

Every since the whole Judith Miller/Matthew Cooper tug-of-war, most of us news buffs have been trying to make out heads or tails of what's going on in Patrick Fitzgerald's head. What was the motivation to leak Valerie Plame's name to the media? Whodunit? If it really is this neo-con conspiracy to discredit Joe Wilson after he criticized the Bush administration, why would a Bush-controlled Justice Department appoint a special prosecutor to take down, dare I say, the "Architect" himself. It just doesn't make sense to me.

And we've all heard the buzz the last few weeks. After Rove's fifth appearance before the grand jury, everyone was wondering why he did it. The word on the street is his lawyer requested the additional testimony to give Rove one last chance to plead his case. If that's the case, then did Fitzgerald buy it? I want to know!

We are supposed to know very soon what the outcome of the investigation will be for Rove. I guess you could say I'm on the yay-indictment side of thinking. I have a sinking feeling this innocent looking doughboy has gotten himself into some seedy stuff while at the top of the ladder. If he's not going down for Plamegate, what about those Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads back in 2004? Congress doesn't have the balls to take down their beloved Bush, we have to look to the special prosecutors to do it for them. 

Basically, I feel Rove has been caught taking too many cookies from the cookie jar and its time for a time out. As we kooky Democrats and other interested parties wait with baited breath for news, I just hope something interesting will come around to take my attention. These NSA stories are just so boring.

<center><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/southvalleyrun.jpg" border="1" /></center>

Everyone has goals and resolutions. My new year's resolution is to run a marathon. It's a really dumb idea I got into my head last year after I ran in the Peachtree Road Race. That was an amazing experience, and even though 6.2 miles was well within my abilities at the time, the thought of running 26.2 miles seemed like it was impossible. I don't know why, but at that moment, I knew that at some point in my life I wanted to do it.

While I was looking for a job, I was considering moving someplace completely different than Georgia. When I landed in California, I thought that fulfilling my marathon goal would be a great task to take on that would help me meet other serious runners. On one boring evening back in February, I signed up to train with an organization called Team in Training, which helps train would-be marathoners and raises money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Not only would I be fulfilling a life-long goal of mine, I would also be fighting for a noble cause.

The training has been grueling. Almost 2 weeks ago we hit our maximum training distance of 20 miles! That was not pleasant, let me tell you. I know that crossing that finish line is going to feel so freaking amazing, but waking up at the crack of dawn every Saturday for the past 4 months has not been a picnic. Oh, to be out on Friday night instead of woofing down carbs and going to bed early :-(

This week, we take on a simple 10 mile run and then we give it a rest before hitting the track in San Diego on Sunday, June 4th. I am so glad this is almost over. You have no idea what a burden training for a marathon is. I can't wait to have a spot of normalcy for a good rest-of-my-life.

Seriously, when people ask if I'm going to do it again, I shutter at the thought. I refuse to say I'm off marathons for good, but I would say if I ran more than eight miles in a two-hour period in the next three years, it would be too soon. We'll see how I feel after the marathon, though.

I have to say, it feel pretty good striking a major life goal from my list as well as fulfilling my New Year's resolution before summer. Isn't that usually a task given up sometime before Thanksgiving? Well, not for me :-)

Marathon training sucks, and hopefully you are spending your Saturdays doing something much more pleasant. If you want to lend a hand, though, my fundraising deadline is this Friday, May 26th! I need all the help I can get, so please, if you haven't already made a contribution, please send one my way. 75% of the funds we raise goes straight to cancer research. It's a great cause and your contribution is an essential part of my goal to complete the marathon. Please, send some love my way!

If you would like to contribute to my fundraising goal, please click <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/tntccal/tntccalNMcclel" target="_blank">here</a> to visit my donation page. Thanks a bunch!

Well, today I have to do some cross-training. Expect some more marathon news very soon!

<blockquote>[For the photo above, that's me and a bunch of walkers out at Yokohl Valley on a chilly Saturday morning. I am in the #3 group, which means every week I run more than everyone! I usually finish second or third out of the entire South Valley team!]</blockquote>

<a href="http://www.hotair.com"><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/hotair.jpg" border="1" hspace="10" /></a>Ok, I know I'm going to get some flack for this, but I think I have a thing for Michelle Malkin. Yeah, I know, I know. She's positively ghastly. There's not a commentator out that that is more disgustingly neo-con, with the exception of the deplorable Ann Coulter (a blond I could <em>never</em> admire). I'm not saying Michelle Malkin is my ideological match by far, I'm just saying I don't hate her.

If you know anything about me, you should know that I'm a moderate. As a journalist, and as an extension, a citizen of the United States, I refuse to look at one party for all the answers. I believe each issue facing this county deserves a vigorous debate and no party platform provides all the answers (or any in most cases). While some of my favorite blogs are left-leaning, I do find myself treading on the dark side. When I'm playing in the dirt, you're most likely to see me mudding it up with Malkin.

About a month ago, I saw a video blog by John Aravosis over at <a href="http://www.politicstv.com">PoliticsTV</a>. He runs an interesting blog, <a href="http://www.americablog.com">AmericaBlog</a>, that mostly spits out the day's top stories along with some liberal bitching and moaning. I go to the blog often, but I can only take so much unabashed Bush bashing. His video blog, Monday Morning Blogger, is even more annoying. Actually seeing the guy parading around like some arrogant would-be broadcast journalist is sometimes too much to bear.

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/malkinmug.jpg" hspace="10" border="1"/>Anyways, he pointed out a few weeks ago that commentator Michelle Malkin had copied his brilliant video blogging idea (yeah right, John, you weren't the first one). So I checked out Malkin's video blog, Vent at <a href="http://www.hotair.com">HotAir.com</a>. And I have to say, aside from abundance of nausiating neo-conservative fumes, it's much more even-tempered and well done. Malkin does the blog daily and she has quite the face for broadcast. You have to admit she is adorable (even if that cute smile hides a devil within).

One Vent I enjoyed was her rant on <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/vent/2006/05/19/conservative-commencement/">conservative commencement</a> speakers. I thought she made a good point. It's ok for Jodie Foster to make a political statement when she delivers a graduation speech (and acts like a complete fool singing an Eminem rap), but when conservative speakers come up to bat, they are ridiculed, protested and booed. I'm not a big fan of Condolezza Rice or John McCain, but they are elected officials in our government and they do deserve a little respect. Not much, but just a little.

I don't always agree with Michelle. Sometimes her video blogs can be kind of scary. During her first full week of video blogging, she covered the upcoming <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/vent/2006/04/27/hijacking-flight-93-again/">United 93</a> movie release. She discussed the fact that the film came out to mostly decent reviews (though she disturbingly highlighted that Rush Limbaugh called the film "powerful" -- because that's the first guy I go to for movie reviews) She goes on some diatribe against Universal Studios and its Web site for United 93. But the most disturbing thing about the video blog is the ending. After making her point, she says farewell, and adds, "Never, never, never forget," after which she flashes a few disturbing scenes of 9/11. Ok, what is it with neo-conservatives always invoking 9/11 to make their point? America will <em>never</em> forget, but we will certainly move on. We don't know to be reminded of it every five seconds.

So, as I venture for more balance to my blogging, I will always head to Michelle Malkin for a good Vent. I mean, someone needs to balance out the liberal hotheads. (But, just so you don't think I'm really turning to the dark side -- Michelle Malkin is cute but Markos is cuter ;-)

Hey Mark, good to hear from you.  You have your point of view, I have mine.  But you sound like someone who one can have a disagreement with, and not have it turn into a huge ideological pi**ing match.

Anyway, I just came cruising by.  I'm a big Michelle Malking fan.  But it is good to meet someone from the left side of the political spectrum like you who seems to have the common sence and decency you do.

Ideological wars usually are a real bummer.

Good luck with everything.

Nick,

I don't find Mrs. Malkin to be a neo-con.  She surely fits into the conservative category though.  So what's the difference between a neo-con and a conservative?  In my mind conservatives have an ideology (small government, anti-federlist, America first foreign policy, less taxes, pro free market, etc).  Unfortunately, I think the neo-cons also have an agenda:  power, world domination, pro big business, and oppression of individual rights.  They are conservatives only to the extent that these purposes are served.  That may be taking it a little far, but my relationship with the republicans is over (until they clean house of the non-cons).  I will vote my conscience (libertarian).  I can't bring myself to vote for the democrats whom I see as the party of the disenfranchised and anti-capitalist (though one could argue that subsidies for big business are just as anti-capitalist as redistribution of wealth to the "poor").

Here is where I part company with the conservatives; one can agree with their opinions without wishing to impose it by force of law upon others.  Being a conservative makes sense.  It is rational.  Imposing your will upon others by force or threat of force is wrong -- even if done by government (a classical libertarian stance).  For what is government, but a collection of people?

It’s strange, we have a well-funded libertarian think tank, the "Cato Institute," and Mrs. Malkin (individually) makes a bigger impact.  

Regardless, I too enjoy Mrs. Malkin's video blog.

Rob

P.S. Mrs. Melkin's conflicted anti-federalist stand regarding the gay marriage amendment is a significant indicator she is a conservative, not a neo-con.

Perhaps I did use the term "neo-con" a little too liberally. Now that you mention it, what does it mean anyways? Perhaps I will give it some more thought later on in a separate, thanks for the feedback Rob!

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/bigsleep.jpg" border="1" hspace="10">I guess you could say my love for Humphrey Bogart began with the film noir The Maltese Falcon, one of my favorite movies. I just love film noir. It's so dark and hopeless, it's hard to believe it came out of Hollywood at the same time they were producing The Wizard of Oz and Singing in the Rain.

Anyways, my experience with film noir is restricted to The Maltese Falcon and the film I'm blogging about today, The Big Sleep. I want to venture out, but the thought of leaving Bogie is kind of scary. I watched The Big Sleep a few years ago (on an excellent date, by the way) and I have to say I was not a fan. It's such a convoluted story with many twists and turns and even more plot holes. Like most older movies, you have to pay near perfect attention to understand the story (and the first time I saw it I have to admit my attention was elsewhere).

So when I got this movie the second time around, I was sure to eliminate all distractions. The story follows a set up very similar to The Maltese Falcon: Bogart is Philip Marlowe, a private dick that plays by his own rules. It's great to see Bogart in a cocky role like this, fending off the likes of Lauren Bacall and various other loose women.

That's the thing I love about old movies. The women are so beautiful and they are often legends in their own right, not like nowadays when any flakey teen star gets spotlighted. Bacall plays a conflicted Vivian Rutledge, out to protect her deranged sister and rout out the sly Marlowe. They've got such great chemistry on screen, it's no wonder they hooked up so well off the screen.

I have to say I enjoy The Maltese Falcon better. William Faulkner actually helped write the screenplay, which might explain why the plot is so complex. The Maltese Falcon is so much easier to understand and it's got action throughout. The Big Sleep sort of hits a climax when Marlowe busts Joe Brody for blackmail, but then it sort of meanders as you wonder what the real story is. It took a few years and a second viewing for me to finally get it, but it was a film I really enjoyed in the end.

I'm not sure what's next on my list of film noir. Ever since I got Netflix, I have been watching movies I have always wanted to see: Arsenic and Old Lace, Casablanca, All About Eve, Bringing Up Baby, Rear Window and Singing in the Rain, among others. My favorite classic Hollywood actors would have to be Bogie, of course, Cary Grant and Marilyn Monroe. I don't know what it is about Monroe, but when I saw her in Some Like it Hot, I was instantly in love. Also, I haven't seen a Hitchcock film I didn't love.

I'll be sure to share my thoughts on film as they appear to me. This week, I'm watching Metropolis, a silent film from 1927. We'll see how that goes. In the meantime, if you haven't seen a film noir, pick up The Maltese Falcon (or if you're willing, The Big Sleep) and let me know what you think.

<blockquote><em>"My, my, my! Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains! You know, you're the second guy I've met today that seems to think a gat in the hand means the world by the tail."</em> ~ Humphrey Bogart as Philip Marlowe, The Big Sleep</blockquote>

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/tnt.jpg" hspace="10" border="1" />Today I finished my last Saturday morning training run. It went well. 10 miles is a lot less than what we've been doing the last 2 months, but it still seemed like a lot to me. It's nice to be done with running for the day by 8 a.m. instead of 10.

I am in utter disbelief that I will be running a marathon in a week. I don't know what I was thinking in January, but I saw this to the end and I'm finally going to get what I've been waiting for. This year, so far, has been shaped by one thing: the marathon. 

I knew I was going back to visit my friends in Georgia <em>before the marathon</em>. I know that, according to the little sticker on my car window, I won't have to change my oil again until <em>after the marathon</em>. Not having this huge block in the road is going to be dizzying.

I should point out that while I have a marathon to finish in a week, one major hurdle has already been cleared. I am certain I have made my fundraising goal for the event. Believe it or not, in exchange for training with Team in Training and gaining entry to the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon on June 4th, I had to raise $2,600 for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. That's a huge sum, and after months of stalling I finally got to it and the last week has been very successful.

I brought cupcakes along with hummus and pita bread to work as a friendly reminder that my fundraising deadline was the day following. I got great reception from my co-workers, and because most of them gave cash, I was able to clump all that money together and have the company I work for match the donation. If it weren't for that program, I know I wouldn't have made it.

I have been worried for months that my goal to run the marathon would be soured by my inability to make my fundraising goal. I knew when I signed up and when I went through recommitment that making the goal would mean I would have to learn to do things I am not comfortable with. Asking people for money is not my strong suit, but I swallowed my fear and convinced myself this was a good cause and people really responded. I'm still getting belated donations!

I ran with a woman this morning who is running her third Rock 'n' Roll Marathon next Sunday. Her father died of cancer and she heard that this was a very positive program to get involved with that would make a difference. I am so fortunate to not have a impetus like this. I just want to fulfill my goal of running a marathon. I feel like, though I am not personally affected by cancer, I have made a difference in the lives of people that are affected. That's going to make finishing this endeavor that much more significant.

Thanks to all that have made contributions to my fundraising effort! Please keep in mind that you can still make a contribution by clicking <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/tntccal/tntccalNMcclel">here</a>.

Wish me luck next week! San Diego, here I come!

By Paul Pringle and Hemmy So<br />
Los Angeles Times

In early April, the two women dropped by a Sunday lunch for the homeless at Hollywood Presbyterian Church.

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/aunts.jpg" border="1" hspace="10" />They fit the picture of the charity-minded, a pair of kind souls happy to spend the afternoon helping the less fortunate.

They chatted with church volunteers and found themselves being introduced to Pastor Charles Suhayda.

"They seemed like nice ladies," he recalled. "They were like grandmothers."

The memory of the encounter now chills him.

The women, Olga Rutterschmidt and Helen Golay, are the septuagenarian odd couple charged in an alleged life insurance scam involving the hit-and-run deaths of two homeless men. ...

On Tuesday a federal grand jury indicted Golay, 75, and Rutterschmidt, 72, on 10 counts of fraud in connection with more than $2 million in life insurance policies that they took out on Paul Vados and Kenneth McDavid, who were struck and killed by cars in 1999 and 2005. ...

Rutterschmidt and Golay were not related to Vados and McDavid, but allegedly put the homeless men up in apartments and kept track of them for two years. That is the period after which the insurances policies generally could not be voided for misrepresentations, according to court documents.

The women are accused of collecting the insurance money after claiming to be the men's aunts, cousins, business partners or, in Golay's case, a fiancee. They were arrested after being spotted in the company of other indigent men, authorities say.</blockquote>

I guess the big difference between <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em> would be the absense of a neurotic Cary Grant. Oh, and instead of his crazy, well-meaning aunts being shipped off to the mental institution, they are instead indicted and sent to prison.

Oh, how times have changed.

<p><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/marathon.jpg" hspace="10" border="1">It has been a while, but I guess you could say I have been &quot;recovering.&quot; I did indeed run a marathon on June 4, 2006, and all I can say, if you have to ask me to describe it so succinctly, is that it was &quot;something else.&quot;</p>
<p>That's the number one thing I find annoying about people asking me about the marathon. They expect me the boil down a five hour and eighteen minute experience into just a few words. It's impossible! So many things happen to you during a marathon, and it took me a few days to process the whole thing myself. Well, I think I'm ready to write about it, so here goes.</p>
<p>I didn't actually look at the course map until a week before I ran the race. For some reason, knowing anything about the race was immaterial to me until I raised enough money before my fundraising deadline (by the way, I raised $2,640 for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society). Once that was squared away, I started to actually consider running the marathon which, surprisingly, was a very funny thing. When I first looked at that map, I started laughing out loud. We run all over downtown San Diego, and when that's all done with, it's still only 10 miles! There's 16.2 miles of hell right after that!</p>
<p>Team in Training did a send-off for us. I brought tofu, rice and veggies to the potluck, but not many people had much (too bad, more for me). We got our singlets and race info. Early Saturday morning we met at the Holiday Inn on Plaza Drive. We took a slow bus to San Diego and my mentor gave me some useful advice for running my first marathon (which he had done only months earlier).</p>
<p>Sometime before or after going over the Grapevine, I was listening to &quot;The Wand&quot; off the new Flaming Lips album, tapping my feet on the ground, when I started thinking to myself...<em>I forgot my running shoes!</em> No joke. Worst possible thing you could do before running a marathon, and it happened to me. For a split second, I thought to myself, &quot;How the hell could you do something so stupid?!&quot; But a second later, I regained my composure and started to think of a solution to my problem. I would just have to buy a new pair of shoes at the Expo.</p>
<p>San Diego is very nice. It reminded me of Atlanta with lots and lots of sun. I frantically combed over the Expo looking for a New Balance booth, but I had to settle on a pair of Mizunos that actually looked very similar to the shoes I had been running in all season. After I got my timing chip, Rock 'n' Roll Marathon commemorative shirt and number, I went back to the hotel for a nap before heading out to the TNT Pasta Party at the convention center. After filling up on carbs, I was off to bed.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessone.com/blog/sd_course_map_06.gif"><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/sd_course_map_06.gif" width="275" length="355" hspace="10" border="1"></a>Up until that point, it was all still a big joke. I was still laughing about it at the Pasta Party, a mere 10 hours before the race started. But on the race day morning, there's nothing left to do but run. I got dressed, headed out to the bus at about 3:45 in the morning and got to the start line around 4. We had about two hours before start, so I just laid there, listening to my iPod and waited. I was in such a daze, I really felt like I could run the whole day, so I'm glad I wasn't super tired and pessimistic or it would have been so much more difficult.</p>
<p>Once we were all corralled at the front, there was no turning back. I was in corral 12, but unlike the Peachtree Road Race, which takes almost 45 minutes to get from your corral to the starting line, it was only about 7 minutes after the actual start time that I was off and running. The first few miles were not too difficult. I just ignored the new shoes and pretended not to care. I was so focused on the bands playing at the side of the road and the spectators that I didn't even notice how slowly the mile numbers trickled by.</p>
<p>I thought that maybe I would be so preoccupied at the beginning thinking about the incredible distance I was trying to surmount, but I was really ambivalent at that point. I was just in a daze, thinking about a lot of different things. I mostly took the race in 2 to 3 mile increments. At mile 2 I had some Powerade. At mile 5, I took a PowerGel and had some water. And then 2 miles later, I took some more Powerade. It's easier if you think of the race like that instead of taking on the whole behemoth at once.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I hit mile 11 that I started to have some problems. I started getting a blister on my foot, which I mostly ignored. I was also hitting a point in the race where the course got kind of boring (we were running on an Interstate!) so I started to drift. I would walk through all the water stations, but I started walking 2 minutes instead of just one. I got to see my coach at around this time, so that was great motivation to keep me going up to the half.</p>
<p>The race dragged on from here, and around mile 18 I started doing intervals of walking and running. One of my team members was running at a pretty consistent pace, so she kept passing me while I was running and I kept passing her when I would start up again at a 9 minute pace. We tried to keep each other motivated, and it was great to get that encouragement at that point in the race.</p>
<p>At about mile 21 and 22, we hit this point where we did a small loop and sort of double backed on the course. I was so finished at this point, it was at this moment that I hit my &quot;wall.&quot; It was pure will power that drove me on from here. I tried to run to mile 24 and walk to 25 and put up a final sprint through to 26.2, but I mostly did my intervals. I got some encouragement from my coaches and some pointers on the finish line that were very useful.</p>
<p>But at this point, you got to realize, I was a physical wreck. I had been doing intervals for a while, and it had gotten to be so difficult to switch from running to walking and vice versa. Every time I would start running again, it was like I was pulling my legs out of stiffening concrete. I was so ready to collapse.</p>
<p>After we entered to Marine depot, my coach told me that when I saw a tunnel, I could expect to see the finish line just beyond it. Once I saw the tunnel, I was so determined to finish, I quit walking and start sprinting to the finish. I think I got to about a 6:45 pace, my best of the entire race &#8212; I was so through with it. Once I passed over the finish line, I swear it was such a rush. You think you would have something amazing to punctuate that moment, but I was so relieved and I could quite honestly have burst into tears at the moment if I had tried hard enough.</p>
<p>See, that's the thing. I learned in that moment why people are crazy enough to run marathons. I didn't want to cry because I was sad. I didn't want to cry because I was depressed, either. I wanted to cry, I believe, because I was mourning the fact that this marathon was so difficult. I took myself to my limit and then pushed myself four extra miles, and for what? There was no reclining chairs at the finish line, there was no handsome reward (except for this really nifty medal they gave us). All there was was this incredible feeling that I had survived something physically grueling and the promise that I would recover from it. I felt like, had this been some life or death situation, where I had survived some horrible ordeal, like being stranded on some mountain or something, I would experience the same exact feeling. Equal parts relief, exhaustion and triumph.</p>
<p>I got myself a bagel, (a medal), some blister relief shoes and my personal things. I called my mother and a few of my friends and then made my way back to the hotel room for a much deserved nap. After you run a marathon, you feel not unlike a midget on stilts &#8212; I felt like I could fall over at any moment. Short distances, like hunting around the TNT Victory Party for a vegetarian alternative to ribs and chicken, became major endurance treks. Oh, if I could have just sat down for 3 days...</p>
<p>But I made it. Recovery is going well, I started running again on Monday (I know, I'm crazy), and I am even planning on running a marathon again sometime. I would like to get myself more prepped for the next time around, though. I was just running this one to finish. Next time around, I want to break 4:30 :-)</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who supported me in my marathon goal! I couldn't have done it without you! </p>

<p><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/downfall.jpg" border="1" hspace="10">This week, I saw a movie called &quot;Downfall,&quot; which is a film about the final days of the Third Reich during World War II. I added it to my movie queue a few months ago when I read that the movie had caused a stir when it was released. Hitler, who is often depicted as a brutal dictator and inhuman monster (rightly so) is somewhat humanized in the film, as the viewer almost feels sorry to watch the ailing man's empire fall to pieces. It was appropriate that I watched this film after another film I had been hotly anticipating. That movie was Sarah Silverman's &quot;Jesus is Magic,&quot; a stand-up comedy film that pokes fun at the Holocaust and other touchy subjects. (And, in case you're wondering, I didn't find the film to be particularly good, or funny).</p>
<p>Anyways, &quot;Downfall&quot; was an excellent movie to watch. The movie mostly depicts the elite heads of Germany in their last days as the Red Army encircles Berlin. For any history buff, this would be a fabulous film, as many notable Nazi government officials are paraded throughout the film. I got so lost in the long list of characters, that it was only at the end of the film when names were provided with pictures that I was able to ascertain just who it was I was seeing half the whole time.</p>
<p>The one character you do follow easily throughout the film (besides Adolf Hitler) is Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's favorite secretaries and the primary source for most of the film. Shortly before Junge died in 2002, she wrote a detailed account of her experiences in the F&uuml;hrerbunker. Her book, <i>Der Untergang</i>, was released in 2004 and is the primary source of the film. She gives a brief introduction interview before the film begins and some final reflections at the end.</p>
<p>The movie begins with Junge being hired as Hitler's secretary in 1942, in the midst of the Second World War. The movie quickly jumps forward to April 20, 1945, &#8212; Hitler's birthday &#8212; as artillery fire is just hitting Berlin and military commanders scramble to halt the Russian's advance. The government building is quickly evacuated and arrangements are made for high-ranking officials to leave Berlin. Of course, Hitler stays, and Junge, unable to abandon her F&uuml;hrer, can so no reason to leave as well.</p>
<p>There are some well-recognized characters in the film. Magda Goebbels arrives with her children to cheer up Hitler and sing for him (And, in case you don't know your history, they all meet a very short end). Eva Braun shows up, determined to not let the fall of her nation get her down. One of the most haunting scenes of the movie is her insistence to go above ground and throw a party while the Russians are shelling the city (of course, driving the drunken revelers back below).</p>
<p>The movie just gets more and more depressing from there. It's one thing to see the dark consequences from war through the eyes of the victor, but what was it like to be German when your nation falls to the Allies? How would it feel like to see all the silent whispers of the &quot;final solution&quot; turn out to be horribly true, even beyond your greatest nightmares. That is the story you see though the eyes of Junge, and it is so compelling. I can't imagine hell being any different from the crumbling Berlin you see in director Oliver Hirschbiegel's film.</p>
<p>It's a must-see, you know, if you can get past the fact that you'll be seeing a film about Hitler and it's subtitled. But, if you're anything like me, you know the best films are probably not in English anyways.</p>
<blockquote><i>Of course, the terrible things I heard from the Nuremberg Trials, about the 6 million Jews and the people from other races who were killed, were facts that shocked me deeply. But I wasn't able to see the connection with my own past. I was satisfied that I wasn't personally to blame and that I hadn't known about those things. I wasn't aware of the extent. But one day I went past the memorial plaque which had been put up for Sophie Scholl in Franz Josef Strasse, and I saw that she was born the same year as me, and she was executed the same year I started working for Hitler. And at that moment I actually sensed that it was no excuse to be young, and that it would have been possible to find things out</i> &#8212; Traudl Junge</blockquote>

<p>I know I have been the sporadic blogger as of late. I have been working early shifts this week and trying to keep up with a very brutal work out/running schedule. I will try to keep up though!</p>
<p><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/vertigo.jpg" border="1" hspace="10" />This week I watched arguably Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece film <em>Vertigo</em>. My recent descent into all things Hitchcock was inspired by my viewing of &quot;Rear Window&quot; several months ago that had me witness a different, more suspenseful side of Hitchcock than the wacky antics of Cary Grant in &quot;North by Northwest.&quot; I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Rear Window,&quot; and I have recently also viewed &quot;Dial M for Murder,&quot; which didn't turn out to be half bad either.</p>
<p><em>Vertigo</em> was next on the list, and I thought I knew what I was getting. In the film, Detective John Ferguson (played brilliantly, of course, by James Stewart) suffers a traumatic event, strickening him with acrophobia and subjecting him with vertigo whenever he suffers an episode. I figured the story would jut off from there into a typical Hitchcock storyline. You know, maybe Stewart has to juggle his fear of heights and his desperate need to solve a case of murder and deceit, set in the sunny city of San Francisco. What I got, however, was a film that was so unlike Hitchcock &#8212; or so I thought.</p>
<p>Instead, shortly after suffering an accident on duty, which leaves a fellow officer dead, Ferguson retires from the force. At the behest of an old friend Gavin Ester, he is asked to trail Ester's disturbed wife Madeline, who Ester believes is possessed by her deceased ancestor, Carlotta Valdes, who killed herself after her husband ran off with her daughter. Presumably, all the women in Madeline's family line eventually go mad, cursed by the scorned Valdes.</p>
<p>The movie descends into this sordid plot and the circumstances of Ferguson's premature retirement drift further and further from the core of the thriller, which very quickly becomes a romance. As John and Madeline fall deeper and deeper in love and her madness broadens, bringing her to the brink of oblivion, the film reaching a gripping height followed by a surprising reversal, and all of a sudden you can't help but jump up and exclaim, &quot;Now, <em>this</em> is a Hitchcock film!&quot;</p>
<p>I can't possibly go on from there. All I can say is every Hitchcock film plays a role in this film. Romance, intrigue &#8212; murder! <em>Vertigo</em> has got it. </p>
<p>If you have no semblance of what the film Vertigo is, I suggest you come into this film as ignorant as I was. You will be rocked, I guarantee it. I don't know if it gets any better than this, I sure hope so. My next Hitchcock film is <em>Lifeboat</em>. We'll see how it goes.</p>

You should check out Rope, which also has Jimmy Stewart.  It's not one of his greatest films, but we thought it was pretty good.

<center><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/visalia.jpg" border="1" /></center>
<p>I live in Visalia, Calif, and it's not like any place I've lived before. Visalia is like a suburb without a city, a fruit without the vine. It is often boring and uninteresting, but at the same time it is beautiful and serene. The landscape is breathtaking, the mountains are just awesome. Agriculture is abounds and there is always an excellent farmer's market going on someplace. It's a nice place to live, for the most part. At least I've managed to get by. </p>
<p>It's hard to believe that I've been here for 9 months already. I remember thinking a year living here was going to mean so much, but it still feels like the day I pulled up in my car, looking for a place to live. I can't believe so much time has flown by. I don't want to live here forever, but for the next year or so, it's not such a bad idea. I have kept myself busy, but I feel like I still need to commit to this place some more.</p>
<p>Training for the marathon was a great way to keep my feet on the ground in Visalia. I had a team that I ran with and I got to see some great running spots close to town. My favorite place to run is Yokohl Valley, this area down Highway 198 off of Yokohl Drive that takes you into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It's very pretty and ranchers keep a lot of cattle out there. It was entertaining to trot down the road mooing at the cows staring at me as I ran by.</p>
<p>Running has been the one thing I have done most in Visalia. It's not as challenging as the roads back in Georgia, but I do love Visalia for it's safe streets and plentiful running space. Restaurants are lacking, though, in my opinion. Being a vegetarian makes it kind of difficult to find food for my selective palate. Most of the places I enjoy most are too expensive for casual dining or just too far away.</p>
<p>A lot of people around here go to Fresno to party or go out, but I have not jumped on that band wagon yet. It's difficult when you don't have an established network of friends like I had back home. It's not that I don't have any friends, but the friends I do have here are not Fresno-party friends. They are mostly easygoing-Visalia friends. And while they may not take me to the more exciting places in the Central Valley, it is nice to know I have someone to get a drink with in boring ol' Visalia.</p>
<p>When I moved here, I figured I would travel to San Francisco or Los Angeles more often to escape the void that is Visalia, but steep gas prices have mostly snuffed that idea. I am going to go to San Francisco in two weeks to see some friends from college, I can't wait. There's nothing like seeing a familiar face out here where I know so few people.</p>
<p>A friend of mine asked me this weekend if I regret coming here to Visalia. It's been 9 months, and while things aren't always as exciting as they were back when I was in college, I can say that I don't regret it. I wonder how I would feel if I had stayed in Georgia, and I know I would have regretted not taking the chance to go someplace different. I'm glad that I found the courage to take a chance.</p>
<p>But I should have to courage to embrace Visalia. I feel like I still reach out to home and am stuck someplace in between. That's probably the worst part of living here &#8212; <em>really</em> living here. Meeting people, making friends and building relationships that start to become more relevant than the relationships you left behind. I think, having been here 9 months already, I should establish those ties. It's difficult, but I probably won't be happy here until I do.</p>
<p>It's sad to watch the past drift away, but if you don't have anything to do besides watch it pass, it can be really depressing. I'm glad that I have such a vibrant, intriguing place like Visalia to make my present worth holding onto.</p>

There has been a lot of talk this week about the New York Times and its publication of an article discussing the details of a government program that monitors the international wire transfers of Americans suspected of being terrorists. Republicans on Capitol Hill are considering taking legal action against the Times, which in the past year has exposed legally-questionable Executive programs that have not been legally verified outside of the Oval Office or a closed session of a select Congressional committee.

I understand the argument posed by critics that say revealing programs like the NSA's domestic spying initiative and the Swift financial records program causes irreputable harm to national security, and the New York Times does as well. This was put forth in a very excellent editorial in today's edition of the Times:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/opinion/28Wed1.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fEditorials">Patriotism and the Press</a>
<br>
New York Times Editorial

Over the last year, The New York Times has twice published reports about secret antiterrorism programs being run by the Bush administration. Both times, critics have claimed that the paper was being unpatriotic or even aiding the terrorists. Some have even suggested that it should be indicted under the Espionage Act. There have been a handful of times in American history when the government has indeed tried to prosecute journalists for publishing things it preferred to keep quiet. None of them turned out well — from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the time when the government tried to enjoin The Times and The Washington Post from publishing the Pentagon Papers.

... But any argument by the government that a story is too dangerous to publish has to be taken seriously. There have been times in this paper's history when editors have decided not to print something they knew. In some cases, like the Kennedy administration's plans for the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, it seems in hindsight that the editors were over-cautious. (Certainly President Kennedy thought so.) Most recently, The Times held its reporting about the government's secret antiterror wiretapping program for more than a year while it weighed administration objections.

Our news colleagues work under the assumption that they should let the people know anything important that the reporters learn, unless there is some grave and overriding reason for withholding the information. They try hard not to base those decisions on political calculations, like whether a story would help or hurt the administration. It is certainly unlikely that anyone who wanted to hurt the Bush administration politically would try to do so by writing about the government's extensive efforts to make it difficult for terrorists to wire large sums of money.

From our side of the news-opinion wall, the Swift story looks like part of an alarming pattern. Ever since Sept. 11, the Bush administration has taken the necessity of heightened vigilance against terrorism and turned it into a rationale for an extraordinarily powerful executive branch, exempt from the normal checks and balances of our system of government. It has created powerful new tools of surveillance and refused, almost as a matter of principle, to use normal procedures that would acknowledge that either Congress or the courts have an oversight role.
</blockquote>
It is an excellent rebuttal and I hope everyone takes the time to read it. A lot of people neglect to recognize that there are actually four branches of government. Established by the First Amendment, the press is responsible for holding our goverment accountable to the people. As Congress has neglected time and again its role to provide oversight for the Bush Administration, intrepid newspapers like the New York Times have found it necessary to take extraordinary methods to alert the public to its governments failings.

I think the Times took sufficient ethical steps in its decision to publish their stories and I view any government official's criticism of the Times to be very dubious. Appealing to the fear of endangering national security has become a favorite of this government, and it's getting old. I just hope people will start catching on.

Today, the Supreme Court ruled on the long-awaited case Hamden vs. Rumsfeld. The Court delivered a harsh rebuke of the Bush Administration and it's claim that it may try enemy combatants in front of military tribunals, with little of the rights compared to those afforded to defendants in U.S. criminal courts.

<blockquote>Supreme Court Blocks Guantánamo Tribunals<br>
By John O'Neil and Scott Shane<br>
New York Times

The Supreme Court today delivered a sweeping rebuke to the Bush administration, ruling that it exceeded its authority by creating tribunals for terror suspects that fell short of the legal protections that Congress has traditionally required in military courts.

<center><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/hamdansmall3sub.gif" border="1"></center>

As a result, the court said in a 5-to-3 ruling, the tribunals violated both American military law and the military's obligations under the Geneva Conventions.

The court ruled two years ago that Congress had not given the executive branch a "blank check" in the war on terror. But today's ruling, written by Justice John Paul Stevens, was the first to address the standards that should apply to suspects held in what has become a prolonged struggle.</blockquote>

This is perhaps the most awaited decision of the Roberts Court so far. I think it was decided fairly and the decision is just. The Bush Administrations solution for dealing with enemy combatants, while efficient, tramples on their rights as defendants and violates the law.

The decision doesn't surprise me. I have a lot of faith in the Supreme Court in its ability to deal with issues such as this. The most troubling aspect of this decision, of course, is the dissent.

Bush has appointed two Justices in his term as President. He has shifted the Court to the right with the appointment of Justice Samuel Alito to replace Sandra Day O' Conner. Certainly, if she had been aloud to vote in this case, she would have sided with the majority opinion, yielding a 6-3 vote. Though a 5-3 vote isn't that bad, if Chief Justice Roberts had not reclused himself from the case, the decision would have certainly been 5-4 &#8212; hardly decisive.

In the short run, I don't think the Court's shift to the right will make too many waves. I believe the Courts docket will get more controversial as now four right-wing Justices can easily accept writ of certiorari. Already, the Court has two controversial abortion cases that will be decided within the next year.

In Scalia, Thomas and Alito's dissent, all Justices cite Congress' attempt to strip the Court of jurisdiction in the case as a valid reason to ignore the case altogether. They also cited the dangers of the majority's decision:

<blockquote>Justice Scalia focused on the jurisdictional issue, arguing that Congress had stripped the court of jurisdiction to proceed with this case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, No. 05-184, when it passed the Detainee Treatment Act last December and provided that "no court, justice, or judge" had jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus petitions filed by detainees at Guantánamo Bay.

The question was whether that withdrawal of jurisdiction applied to pending cases. The majority held that it did not.

Justice Thomas's dissent addressed the substance of the court's conclusions. In a part of his opinion that Justices Scalia and Alito also signed, he called the decision "untenable" and "dangerous." He said "those justices who today disregard the commander in chief's wartime decisions" had last week been willing to defer to the judgment of the Army Corps of Engineers in a Clean Water Act case. "It goes without saying that there is much more at stake here than storm drains," he said.</blockquote>

One premise of the minority's opinion is that we are at war and wartime affords the President the latitude to suspend habeas corpus in times of war. While this is in the Constitution, I don't believe the premise holds weight. How much of a &quot;war&quot; is the war on terror? How long will the war of terror last? What is a victory in the war on terror?

Did the framers of the Constitution view war to be the lifelong struggle between a nation and a seemingly endless band of terrorists or is war a point when a nation enters into conflict with another nation. I think this war is not the &quot;war&quot; the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they impugned the President with power to put justice aside.

I think this is the fundamental debate that we need to wage. At this moment, the right and left are trying to wage completely different arguments. Pundits like Michelle Malkin see the war on terror as World War III, while Democrats, liberals (and dare I say moderates) see the war on terror akin to something like the war on drugs, but much more serious. I think once our nation gets on the same page and settles this fundamental argument, we can come up with solutions to the problems facing us.

<img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/capote.jpg" class="imageright" align="right">I told myself when I was watching <em>Capote</em> that I probably wasn't going to write about it. For some reason, writing about a near-recent film wasn't as exciting as going on about films that have been out for decades or films that no one has ever heard of. We all know Philip Seymour Hoffman won the Oscar for Best Actor this year, but has anyone really seen <em>Capote</em>? Do you even know what it's about?

I do. At least I do now. Before watching this movie, I had know idea who Truman Capote was, and I know that's sad. Certainly any graduate with an English degree has heard of <em>In Cold Blood</em>, right? Well, not this little Bachelor.

Despite my ignorance, it didn't take me long to catch on. Capote, hot off the success of his book <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em>, picks up a copy of the New York Times to read about the grisly murder of a family of four living in Holcomb, Kansas. Taking off for a writing assignment for the <em>New Yorker</em>, Capote enlists the help of fellow writer Harper Lee, then soon-to-be Pulitzer Prize winner for the book <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, and travels down to Kansas to get to the heart of the story.

Capote initially has some trouble getting the local authorities and residents to respect him and speak to him. Of course, he eventually makes his way into the story and almost by accident befriends on of the suspects in the murder, Perry Smith.

This movie reminded me a lot about what I enjoyed <em>Downfall</em> so much. I've been recently fascinated with villains. The downfall of Hitler, the mental state of cold-blooded killers — both films really gave me a lot to think about. Working at a newspaper, I often find myself on the right side of things passing "judgment" on those who break the law. Really, that's not what I do at the paper, anyone is innocent before proven guilty, but by even mentioning that someone is "accused" of murder is tantamount to condemnation, often times. Sometimes I wonder if what makes people commit such horrible acts is really a fundamental state of evil or if it is just one person who was very, very lost.

There's a moment at the end of <em>Capote</em> when you get to see just what pushed Perry to commit such a horrible act. It was a profound and fascinating moment and it made me want to read the book.

Hoffman does an excellent job wrestling with his hunger for critical acclaim and success and his persistent desire to aid his friend Perry. Of course, before Capote can move on with his life and finish <em>In Cold Blood</em>, Perry must exhaust all of his appeals and hung for the crimes he and codefendent Richard Hickock committed.

It's a great film, and if you see it, I think you will find it more interesting than you thought.

As the fallout of the disclosure of the SWIFT banking surveillance program expands, more right-wing conservatives are jumping on the band wagon and bashing the news organizations that published the story. One of my favorite conservative blogs, the California Conservative, <a href="http://www.californiaconservative.org/?p=3427">blasts</a> the Los Angeles Times' <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-baquet1jul01,0,4783385.story?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">recent op-ed</a> by Times editor Dean Baquet and New York Times executive editor Bill Keller as failing to address the central grievance against the publication of the story in question.

<center><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/flimsyexcuses.jpg"></center>

In the op-ed, Baquet and Keller discuss the role of the press when breaking sensitive stories like the SWIFT banking surveillance story, the NSA domestic surveillance story and even the historic Pentagon Papers case which then Justice Hugo Black said abolished "the government's power to censor the press ... so that the press would be forever free to censure the government."

The California Conservative breaks down the op-ed, line-by-line, ridiculing much of Banquet and Keller's points, eventually arriving at their point:

<blockquote>The decision to publish an article about an effective program that the NY Times says doesn’t break any laws because it’s “in the public’s interest” is a flimsy excuse to publish such a valuable program as the TFTP (<em>terrorist finance tracking program, as best I can estimate</em>).</blockquote>

Conservatives have blasted the papers on this point, wiping away the arguments of the papers with a single string of words: "The story compromises our national security." This is a powerful argument but I don't think this debate can accommodate it anymore. At least not until we acknowledge certain things.

The public editor, Byron Calame, for the New York Times wrote a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/opinion/02pub-ed.html">great piece</a> on the subject, exploring for himself the Times' decision to publish the story. One aspect he pointed out was that the Administration has only recently disclosed the program to Congress once they received word that it would be exposed by the media (this was also espoused by Think Progress in a <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/02/feinstein-briefed/">recent entry</a>):

<blockquote>Eric Lichtblau, one of the two reporters who wrote the Swift story, told me the administration briefed a limited number of Congressional leaders — apparently from both parties, but not the full intelligence or banking committees — toward the beginning of the program. It wasn't until the Treasury Department learned that The Times was working on the story, Mr. Lichtblau said, that the administration apparently briefed all members of the intelligence committees.</blockquote>

That alone, he says, is reason enough to publish the story. He also hits on the heart of this question posed by the California Conservative that I believe we will all have to address in the coming years — whether the surveillance programs employed by the Administration are temporary executive acts in a time of war or permanent shortcuts for enforcement:

<blockquote>Temporary emergency measures cloaked in government secrecy can too easily become permanent shortcuts. That's why oversight is important. It is also a reason to publish the article. The reservations expressed by some of the 20 current and former government officials and industry executives who were disturbed enough to talk to The Times were based on this concern: "What they viewed as an urgent, temporary measure had become permanent nearly five years later without specific Congressional approval or formal authorization," in the words of the article.</blockquote>

Is this program a temporary measure employed in this war on terror or is it a measure the executive will for years purport to have authority to maintain in the endless fight against terrorism? If the latter is assumed, this program needs Congressional oversight and approval, period. The Constitution is not a doormat, I'd like to think it still means something in this country.

I also take offense to many points of this debate. By simply spitting out those ominous string of words, you know, the whole "national security" argument, is never supported by facts. The press has addressed national security in publishing these articles. Baquet and Keller point out that mundane details that could be vital to terrorists were omitted because they did not deserve the public's interest. Not to mention the fact the the program has already been publicly alluded to for years (a fact routinely swept away by the California Conservative).

Baquet and Keller even point out the the writers of the Washington Post's secret prison story, which prompted an EU investigation, had the names of the countries these prisons operated in but declined to publish them. If the press had a vendetta against the Bush Administration and, as some pundits like Michelle Malkin purport, were jonesing to aid the terrorists in attacking us, don't you think the New York Times would provide full disclosure?

This debate is very serious and it should not be staged in a partisan way. The press holds a very important role in our society and it is an essential freedom that we are supposedly fighting for in this war on terror. As Baquet and Keller point out, "If freedom of the press makes some Americans uneasy, it is anathema to the ideologists of terror."

I can't believe it. I mean, who would have seen it coming? It appears the tragic priestess Kikyo has died. Or is dying, whatever.

Ok, so why is this a big deal? Well, I don't know. Kikyo is the lost love of anime/manga character InuYasha. Technically, this isn't the first time she has died (and it might not be the last), but since the manga is steadily marching toward its big conclusion, I am forced to consider that this is indeed Kikyo's swan song.

I got into <em>InuYasha</em> about 2 and a half years ago out of curiosity. A friend of mine was very into anime, this one imparticular, and all of a sudden I was pulled into the plot. The anime follows the adventures of InuYasha and Kagome, his friend and budding love interest, as they battle demons in feudal Japan. Kikyo was InuYasha's lover from 50 years prior who sealed him to a tree as part of a tragic betrayal involving mistaken identity and their easily broken love and trust for one another. It's a very mythic, captivating story (if you <em>really</em> try to get into it). It reminds me of the Greek myth of Eurydice, but that's another story.

Anyways, Kikyo comes back from the dead, and she's kind of a bitch at first, but eventually she cools down and gets her eye on the ball and dedicates herself to defeating the anime's primary foe, Naraku. The anime ends rather prematurely, as manga chapters come out once a week and after 167 episodes there were no more manga chapters to adapt. After the finale, the manga continues though, and it has for almost two years now.

I eventually found a great site last summer which posts translated scripts from the manga. I followed it through some pretty exciting developments, all up until this week. Having come face-to-face with Naraku and his twisted ambitions, Kikyo finally makes her attempt to destroy him and fails. His jyaki (weird Japanese word translated in the anime as miasma) overcomes her and starts to kill her. Passing her bow to Kagome and spending her last moments with InuYasha, it is presumed in the next chapter Kikyo's life will end...

And it sucks! I only bring this stupid thing up because Kikyo has been a sort of hero for me, in a sick, twisted way. Even though Kagome is the best woman for InuYasha, I have always been sympathetic to her cruel fate and have been rooting for the lost love to take InuYasha away with her into death. Even though that's not likely to happen anymore.

I wrote two poems about the anime. That's really crazy, but for some reason the story inspired something in me. The figures I explored then were InuYasha and Kagome, but I have not explored Kikyo's voice yet. I know she will be the last in this trilogy of poetry, but I have spent the past few months pondering what I have to say for her. On the one hand, she's so strong and composed. On the other, she is bitter for losing her life and having to go on living a frozen death. She's very seldomly forthright with her feelings, which makes me wonder if she would be sentimental at all. I'm still thinking about it, but maybe this development could give me some ideas.

Anyways, if you have any interest, I suggest you venture out onto the Internet and read the chapter. It's really sad to see her go...

kikyo is aweful.  she is basically a walking zombie.  She is the reason that kagome and inuyasha can't be together.  How can he even committ to kagome when he knows that kikyo is out there somewhere?  She needs to go away so he can let go and move on. it makes me so sad. :kikyo is aweful.  she is basically a walking zombie.  She is the reason that kagome and inuyasha can't be together.

I haven't gone many places since my marathon last month, so I figured I would venture out this weekend. Some very good college friends were visiting San Francisco and I couldn't miss the opportunity to see them. I jumped into my car (after forgetting like 3 essential items before leaving) and finally I was off.

I've been to San Francisco twice before, and as a non-California native, I think I finally got it right this time. The first time I visited I came with a friend who matriculates at Stanford University in Palo Alto. We took the Caltrain up and ventured to Fisherman's Warf, Pier 39 and Ghirardelli Square. We had a fabulous, long day, but we hit most of the tourist traps that offered little lasting satisfaction. Bummer.

For New Year's, I went with a friend from Sacramento to party it up in the city. I thought for sure we would see the better parts of the city, seeing as alcohol would be involved. It was very rainy on New Year's Eve, but I made it to San Francisco in plenty of time. My friend, however, was rerouted several times because of landslides on the interstate, so she was 4 hours late! I was stuck in the city, all by myself, on New Year's Eve! I ventured around where I had landed (which was, oddly enough, the one place I wanted to see on my first visit, the Castro district) and spent copious amounts of time perusing Safeway and plugging away on my computer at Starbucks. When my friend finally did show up, we had a fabulous time, but I feel like I could have done more.

This time around, my friends and I poked around the Haight Ashbury and it was very much worthwhile (enough for me to shrug off parking illegally and incurring a $60 parking ticket). For any of you who aren't away, the Haight Ashbury is this area in San Francisco where all the hippies went to die. I saw so many old hippies! Also, lots of dogs strapped to parking meters on the street, psychedelic painted vans and all sorts of beatnik-themed shops (and a few too many corporate sellouts, sadly).

<img alt="noleft.gif" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/noleft.jpg" width="275" height="275" border="0" class="imageright" />We ate at this very cool sandwich place and I got this delicious lettuce, fried green tomato and eggplant parmesan sandwich. We looked at some of the shops, I got a comfy shirt from American Apparel. We went to Amoeba Music where I feel like we spent a whole hour looking and listening to music. I finally picked up the new Snow Patrol album as well as <em>Republic</em>, an older New Order album that was on clearance for only $3 used. I also noticed the Flaming Lips had released a special album entitled The Fearless Freaks, which according to the album's intro was released on a limited basis at SXSW. It contained a haunting live version of "The Observer," one of my favorite Lips songs, as well as a rare track titled "Enthusiasm for Life Defeats Existential Fear."

After this, I drove my friends back to their hotel and I took on the arduous task of leaving the city. It was hard enough getting to Union Square when I arrived. You might find this hard to believe, but for a left-leaning city like San Francisco, you can't make any left turns. It makes it very hard for a newbie like myself to find his way out of the Labyrinth by instead of making a left turn, having to make three right turns.

It was great visiting, I wish I didn't have to leave so soon. It would be nice spending the night again. I did venture to my favorite Safeway to buy some Soy Crisps. It's a shame I ate them so quickly...

<img alt="light1.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/light1.jpg" width="275" height="325" class="imageright" />I know I should just get off it, but come on...she's really dead! I mean, I know I said she was going to die last week, but the bitch exploded into a blaze of light and souls. I don't think anyone walks away from that.

I mean, there are some many things I could be writing about, but I can't help it. There's a budding war in the Middle East (one we didn't actually start), Valerie Plame is suing Karl Rove because Patrick Fitzgerald is too much of a pussy to indict him and I am faced with the daunting reality that I may actually die hiking up Mt. Whitney in less than a month (more on that later).

And all of this is going on and I still can't stop thinking about Kikyo. I mean, it's not like the death of Superman or anything, but it's like a damn Greek tragedy. You know the kind. She's like the tragic hero, except in this case everyone refers to her as the tragic priestess Kikyo. She's doomed to fall in love, falter in her sacred duty and suffer an untimely death. And even after all that happens, after she's brought back a vengeful, walking-clay pot of her former self she's still brought down like a dog. It's just typical.

<img alt="light2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/light2.jpg" width="275" height="313" class="imageleft" />It isn't the first time one of my favorite heroines has bitten the big one (twice even). We all remember Buffy, don't we? At the end of season 1, they pull that whole, "she's fated to die at the hands of the Master" crap and sure enough, she falls into a puddle and "dies." Luckily, someone was paying attention in CPR and she dodged that bullet. We all thought she was home free.

But then, four years later, when she should have just thrown her sister off Glory's twisted Tower of Babel, she makes up some crap about their blood being the "same Summer's blood" and chucks herself to her own untimely demise instead. I, of course, ignorant of Internet spoilers, didn't see it coming and was completely blind sided. Fortunately, slayers are more like the phoenix than the lamb, and she was back with bells on by the end of the next episode.

Let's have a reality check for just a moment. Yeah, Kikyo has drifted up into the sky among a convoy of soul collectors, but who says this is the end? I mean, she's been stuck down before, who says she can't come back as a phantom or a vision? Who says she can't be some possessing spirit? She could come back from beyond on a visit and provide key insight in our hero's bleakest moments and then drift back up to wherever it is clouds of souls go.

<img alt="light4.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/light4.jpg" width="310" height="150" class="imageright" />Anyways, it's over now. The manga can now march in a new direction. With Kikyo out of the picture, I guess Kagome should give Inuyasha maybe a month to mourn for his twice-dead lover and then swing in for the rebound. I mean, they look <em>exactly</em> the same in the manga, it shouldn't be hard for him to adapt.

Well, she said not to mourn, so it's time to move one. Hopefully there will be no moving scenes in next week's issue and I won't feel compelled to waste this space talking about it. Here's hoping!

<img alt="altapeak.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/altapeak.jpg" width="275" height="242" class="imageright" />Of all the things I could have done Sunday, the <em>last</em> thing on my list was climbing an 11,240 foot mountain. I could have slept in, partied it up into the wee hours of the morning in Fresno Saturday night or even talked to my long-lost expatriate friend who lives in France (who actually called when I was on the hike!) I guess, having lived so close to Sequoia National Park for so long and still not having the pleasure of visiting, my curiosity got the better of me.

I have hiked a few mountains in my day. Compared to the peaks I see just outside my window every morning, you could more accurately describe my past experience as mounting glorified hills. California mountains are no joke. I was a big fearful the altitude and terrain would be a challenge for me, but I can honestly say I did quite excellent. It was quite a ride though.

In preparation of my Mt. Whitney hike on August 6th, I went with a friend from work to tackle Alta Peak, a 6-mile hike. We started out from Visalia at 6:30 a.m. and didn't make it to the trail head until 8:30. The drive up was fantastic. You take 198 through the foothills and finally along side the Kaweah River into Three Rivers. From there, it's up until you get to Sequoia Park and then up several windy roads. You could see Moro Rock as we drove higher up into the park. Finally we got to the Giant Forest and I got my first glimpse of the world's largest trees.

<center><img alt="altahike.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/altahike.jpg" width="350" height="263" /></center>

We started at Wolverton and the first hour and a half just flew by. We hiked through about 2 miles of woods and it was fairly easy. We saw a deer right on the onset of the hike and I got a nice picture of its butt. Once we made it to Panther Gap, you could see out into the mountain range, it was pretty spectacular. We passed this rock that's supposed to look like a bear, but it looked like a big rock to me. The hike sort of dragged at this point and I got pretty annoyed at the steadily sharper grades as we approached Alta Meadow. I told my fellow hiker who had only talked me into the trek a day earlier that I had several four letter words saved for her once we finished this hike.

"Oh, you mean 'fun' with two N's?" she retorted. Yeah. Right.

After Alta Meadow, a mere two miles from the peak, it started to suck. The grades became as severe as 19% and it became very difficult to keep a steady pace without taking frequent breathers. The altitude never gave me more than some sinus trouble and some shortness of breath, but I gave myself the benefit of a doubt if I felt too strained. Better to take it easy the first time.

<img alt="whitneyfar.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whitneyfar.jpg" width="300" height="186" class="imageleft" />We finally got to the point where the tree started to disappear and the peak finally <em>seemed</em> to be in sight. Even this late in the summer there remained pockets of snow all around the peak. It was a relief to put a pile of that on my head. As I ascended, there would always be a pile of rocks blocking my view of the top and it would always seem to be just beyond them. I'd push it to get up to the rocks but there always seemed to be <em>another</em> outcropping, which quickly became very annoying. Finally, with the site of a fellow hiker triumphantly perched at the peak, I bee lined it straight to the summit.

It was quite a view. There were a lot of flies, that was annoying, but you've got to give it up for the view. I even saw Mt. Whitney in the distance. It's amazing to think I will be at the top of the Sierra Nevada range in just a couple weeks.

Long story short, the descent was easier than the climb, but descending the steep grades was very bothersome for my knees. I almost slipped several times. I tore it up through most of the trail and we made it out a whole hour earlier than planned.

I wish I had more adventurous friends and family that would be willing to share an experience like this with me. I too often hear people complain about how they could never accomplish such a feat. It really isn't that bad, you never know you can accomplish something as daring as a mountain hike. I remember thinking Kennesaw Mountain back in Georgia was so incredible, but this was 10 times the difficulty as that. It's an incredible feeling surmounting a height like Alta Peak. I can't imagine what Whitney is going to do for me.

In the aftermath: I have a nasty sunburn, my legs were surprisingly filthy (I wore long jeans!) and I am thinking I might do it again next weekend to further train myself for Whitney. We'll see how that goes, I'd like to see a friend of mine in Long Beach, so maybe it will be a SoCal weekend instead of another day touching the sky.

God I love California.

Sorry I've been so scarce. I had a positively dreadful week last week. After my hike up Alta Peak and the excruciating sunburn I received because of it, work was such a drag. Monday and Tuesday was just unbearable, I somehow made it through to the end of the week. I had to work on Friday night, which is always a bore, but this weekend I had the distinct pleasure of seeing my good friend Padmini in Southern California.

Padmini is involved with Teach for America and she is teaching a class of bright kids in a Compton middle school, and from the way she tells it, these kids are very lucky. Granted, they struggle in an unequal education system where they have been neglected for years, but thanks to the dedication and hard work of Teach for America teachers like Padmini, they have a fighting chance.

I had the lucky opportunity to whisk her away from this god-saving work for a superficial day out on the town. We went to this delicious Indian Food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. I hadn't eaten anything all morning, and though I was not sure what I was eating exactly, I had every bite. It was fantastic.

<img alt="walkoffame.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/walkoffame.jpg" width="275" height="258" class="imageright" />Afterward, we parked down by the Kodak Theatre and took a stroll down Hollywood Boulevard. We sorted around through American Apparel and took a stroll down the Walk of Fame. I am sad to say I did not find Humphrey Bogart on the walk, but I did see Marilyn Monroe! She's in front of McDonald's, but as Padmini said, it's was probably not always there.

The weather this weekend in California was positively scorching so after some water and a milk shake (and another trip to American Apparel) we headed back to Long Beach, where she is staying. We hooked up with B.J., another friend of mine from college, and we ventured to yet another vegetarian restaurant. Au Lac. We all shared vegan lobster, salmon and sweet and sour chicken. Afterwards, we went to a great tea shop and played some games. I must point out that I dominated every game of Connect Four and there was significant cackling involved with a sinister game of Uno (which I also won, at least once).

I stayed over the night and after a delightful drive through gay Long Beach, we had some bagels and I headed home. It was the most fun I've had in Los Angeles by far. I'm looking forward to seeing Padmini at her new digs in Las Vegas. Maybe some day, after she's made it as a successful teacher and performer at the legendary Cheetah gentleman's club, I'll let her take me on in Connect Four again :-)

But I'll still win... 

I'll be sure to update more this week. I'm planning some stuff on this persistant heat wave, maybe the Bush veto, the violence in the middle east, but sadly, no more <i>InuYasha</i>. I'll only beat that dead horse if it comes back from the dead...again.

As you sit in your cool, air-conditioned home, likely far from the sunny state of California, you might wonder how things are going here in the Golden State. It's beautiful, as always, but unfortunatly our golden sunsets (as I captured gloriously just the other day) are accompanied by miserable days of high heat and near-daily brownouts.

Since moving to Visalia, I have gotten several cautious words about the seasons here in California. For one, it only rains in the late fall to early winter, and just a little rain goes a long way (ever heard the emergency broadcast signal for a shower? I have). Also, winters in the Central Valley bring in notorious fog. Just this year, one pernicious day of fog resulted in a 40-car pileup on Highway 99.

The few words of warning I shrugged off concerned the summer. As I and so many other people have learned, summers in the Central Valley send temperatures up into the triple digits. Fortunately, it's not humid often and the discomfort usually lasts just a week in the summer. <em>Unfortunately</em> for me, this summer seems to be the exception:

<blockquote><b>California residents sink to new lows as heat reaches new highs</b><br>
The Associated Press

LOS ANGELES &#8212; In a land of sun worshippers, the heat has become the enemy.

Weeks of record-setting, triple-digit temperatures have turned California into a surreal tapestry of heat-induced torture: goldfish cook in their bowls, milk curdles as it's poured and sweat-soaked civilians stand in line for public "cooling stations" as if they were the latest trendy clubs.

In a region where 119-degree days are very recent memories, nothing is off-limits. One woman shaved her overheated cat; another man fried the proverbial egg on a Burbank sidewalk; a third advocated sliding between the sheets with stacks of frozen gel packs.</blockquote>

I'm currently still using my stovetop to cook eggs and my milk is safe in the refrigerator, as far as I know. I had such a pleasant time on the coast this weekend, it's amazing what a difference some marine air has on this awful heat. Maybe if that "big quake" happens in a couple of days, shaving off a few hundred miles off the state leaving Visalia a beachfront city, I might be able to enjoy some of that relief on a daily basis.

For now, I guess I'm just going to have to bake.

<img alt="sevenyearitch.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/sevenyearitch.jpg" width="275" height="428" class="imageright" />When I first saw Marilyn Monroe on screen, I was watching <em>Some Like it Hot</em> in my Shakespeare in Film class during my senior year of college. We all have our preconceptions of Marilyn. She's a tramp. She's a hussie. She died far too soon. Nothing you think about her, though, holds a candle to who she actually is &#8212; or was. But what do I know. I never knew her.

All I have are movies, and when I first saw Sugar Kane jump aboard the all-girl-band's train to Florida, it was almost like seeing a goddess. Marilyn Monroe, on screen, is so poised, beautiful and innocent. She's not a hussie or a tramp, she's just an actress, and a very good one. Watching her belt out "I'm Through with Love" in one of the last scenes of <em>Some Like it Hot</em> was truly memorable.

I've only since seen her bit part in <em>All About Eve</em> (another excellent film with the immaculate Bette Davis). The quench my thirst for Marilyn, I had Netflix send me <em>The Seven Year Itch</em>, a memorable comedy staring Marilyn and Tom Ewell. Ewell plays Richard Sherman, a middle-aged New York businessman who has just sent his wife and son to Maine to weather the brutal summer months away from the big city. Ewell's crazy imagination gets the better of him when his neighbors above him sublet their apartment to a strikingly beautiful young woman with a very striking resemblance to actress Marilyn Monroe (Monroe is actually referenced in the film, but we never learn the girl's actual name &#8212; she could very well be playing herself).

Richard wrestles with his desire to scratch his seven year itch and sweep the girl into his arms in spite of his dutiful wife (who he imagines is probably off on a flirtatious hay ride with Tom MacKenzie, a strapping young writer). Monroe plays innocent, professing her love for champagne and potato chips and eventually falling a little for Richard.

The movie is very cute, all because of Marilyn. She captures every scene she's in. Ewell is very charming as Richard, so much so, he came back to play the part the most of any part he played all his life (on Broadway after the film was released). The movie contains Monroe's most memorable scene &#8212; standing above a subway vent with her skirt being blown up.

Why don't they make women like Marilyn Monroe anymore? Furthermore, why don't they make actresses like her either? When's the last time you saw a movie and just fell in love with an actress, not just for her portrayal, but because you could sense a bit of the existential struggle she silently endured. I guess Hollywood just doesn't do that to them anymore. Something that got lost in the wash of million-dollar salaries.

Well, at least we can look back. I feel like seeing <em>Some Like it Hot</em> again, but perhaps <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em>. We'll see.

If you haven't seen Marilyn, if you are just unaware, you need to see her. You'll be glad you did.

<blockquote><strong>Marilyn Monroe:</strong> "I think it's wonderful that you're married! I think it's just delicate."
<br>
<strong>Richard:</strong> "You do?"
<br>
<strong>Marilyn Monroe:</strong> "Of course. I mean I wouldn't be lying on the floor in the middle of the night in some man's apartment drinking Champagne if he wasn't married."
<br>
<strong>Richard:</strong> "That's a very interesting line of reasoning..."
<br>
<strong>Marilyn Monroe:</strong> "Sure, with a married man, it's all so simple. I mean, it can't possibly ever get drastic..."</blockquote>

<img alt="georgiamind.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/georgiamind.jpg" width="275" height="324" class="imageright" />This entry is one small part reminiscence and one larger part wanting-to-blog but not sure whatfor.

A year ago today, it was my first day in Ohio after leaving Georgia after ten years. My time in Ohio was brief and fairly uneventful, but leaving Georgia was such a huge thing for me, it's just been on my mind. I'm glad I left, though. I feel like leaving proved to me that I could go anywhere. I'm sure one day California will seem dull, and knowing I have left Georgia with much success will mean that I could conceivably go anywhere. Anyways, that's my Georgia piece. Short and painless...

We're hiking up Whitney this weekend. Still not sure if we're doing it in one day or two. I'm aiming for one, which will be rough, but at least I can make it to work on Monday.

Since the Whitney portal is on the eastern side of the park in Inyo County (and there is no direct way to the east side without going around the whole mountain range), it's going to take us probably 4 hours just to drive there. We get to drive through Tehachapi, which was this neat city I blazed through when I was going from Vegas to Visalia. 

I had a dream about Mt. Whitney last night. Something about it being almost like some rest stop in the highway, like those fiber glass dinosaurs on the side of some interstate. I know I'll be fine, hopefully it can help jump start my exercise routine which has been languid these past few weeks. The heat here has been positively unbearable, it's hard to motivate yourself to do anything.

Anyways, kudos to Shirley for this entry's photo element. I keep listening to "Cup of Coffee," and this photo always reminds me of that song.

Oh, and Diaspora sucks (ain't that right Jeremy).

P.S.: I thought I would post more pictures from Alta Peak. Check them out at my Flickr page <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aliensexfiend/">here</a>. One of these days I'm going to have to put in a module, maybe Padmini will have to show me how...

<blockquote><b>Jesse:</b> I've been to marriage counseling. I've done things I never thought I would have do: Lit candles, bought self help books, lingerie...<br>
<b>Celine:</b> Did the candles help?<br>
<b>Jesse:</b> Hell no.<br></blockquote>

<img alt="beforesunset.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/beforesunset.jpg" width="275" height="366" class="imageright" />A few months ago I watched <em>Before Sunrise</em> at the suggestion of my cousin Laura. I suppose I didn't have the blog at the time (maybe, I could have just been too lazy to write about it), but it was a good movie. I watch so movies so often now, a lot of times, when I sit down to watch one I don't give it the attention it deserves. Maybe I neglected <em>Before Sunrise</em>, but I know I liked it. Fortunately, I did not neglect <em>Before Sunset</em>. This one stuck.

It's so funny that I actually like an Ethan Hawke movie. I can't stand the guy. I honestly couldn't stand the first half of <em>Before Sunrise</em> for the sole reason that Ethan Hawke was parading on screen like a horny American college student. Hideous...but I got past it. His chemistry with Julie Delpy is great. They have such an endearing, consuming quality about them and you can't help but wish they were make it past sunrise.

Though the first movie ends with you wanting more, you get the payoff in Before Sunset, 9 years after Jesse and Celine's first encounter in Vienna. Hitting Paris as the last city in his European book tour, Jesse is just wrapping up a book signing and Q&A session when Celine drops by. This monumental occasion &#8212; seeing the woman that made the most memorable impact in his romantic life &#8212; is fumbled by the two of them. You expect the music to crescendo and the scene to be framed by the setting sun, but they handle the situation as anyone would. It's natural and the whole movie progresses as so.

Jesse has to go to the airport in an hour, and a quick coffee with Celine turns into a swift afternoon stroll through Paris. The two take a walk through a park, a boat ride down the Seine and engage in a tumultuous conversation on the ride back to her apartment and their final curtain call.

Jesse is married and Celine is involved, but neither is happy. The movie begins with the two happy to conceal these facts but as they eventually see how much they regret not seizing upon their moment 9 years earlier, the two break down so beautifully. It's a romantic, touching film.

I like it so much because I'm so jealous. My friend Nicole went to France and fell in love. I wish I could do something so romantic! I get to go to Paris in about a month to see Nicole, so I'll be on the lookout for horny French romantics, but I imagine the language barrier might be a problem. At least I have this movie to quench my thirst for good romance.

<center><img alt="whitney1.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whitney1.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></center>

It's absolutely crazy to think that a week ago I was still on Whitney. I've had a week to think about the experience (and produce a special Flash presentation of it for the Visalia Times-Delta which you can view <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/news/multimedia/Whitney.swf" target="_blank">here</a>).

Several months ago, I was asked by Laura at work if I wanted to join her and others on a hike up Mt. Whitney, which she had surmounted less than a year prior at the time with another copy editor from the paper. I enthusiastically agreed, seeing it as an opportunity to do something truly unique in Tulare County. Mt. Whitney it just at the corner of the county in Sequoia National Park between the county and Inyo County and Inyo National Forest. Since I was in the midst of training for a marathon, the thought of topping a 22-mile hike up a 14,505 foot mountain seemed like a piece of cake. I was so wrong.

Hiking Mt. Whitney is not picnic. Aside from the head-pounding altitude, there are 96 relentless switchbacks that are seemingly never ending and so very discouraging. It took 16 hours to get off that freaking mountain, and in just a scant few paragraphs, I will attempt to boil down the experience for you.

<img alt="whitney2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whitney2.jpg" width="275" height="367" class="imageright" />We left for the hike on Saturday morning at 4 a.m. We didn't start the hike until 24 hours after this point, but it was important that we arrive to receive our hiking permit first thing in the morning and have a day of camping to acclimate ourselves to the vicious altitude (which, by nominal standards, isn't that bad. I mean, it's no Everest). You would think since Mt. Whitney is in the county, it would be a short drive away. Also, since it's the tallest mountain in the state and the whole 48 contiguous United States, you might think you would see it from my living room window. All not true. Mt. Whitney is on the far eastern side of the Sierra Nevada and Visalia is nestled on the Western side of the range. We had to drive south to Bakersfield to go around the whole freaking range an into Owens Valley, a graben.

Once we made it to Lone Pine, a small town ness led at the base of Mt Whitney (which was in plain view at this point), we went to get our permit. Interesting note about Lone Pine, it is where most of the Westerns during the Golden Age of Hollywood were filmed.

With permit in hand, Laura, myself and Tiffani (my boss at the paper) made our way up to the Whitney Portal where we were to camp. It was a short drive and my car handled it well (though it nearly overheated). The trail begins at 8,000 feet (Owens Valley, a high desert, is 4,000 feet). I wasn't being hammered by the elevation at this point and I spent most of Saturday relaxing, taking in the scenery and preparing my hiking pack.

We started out at 3 in the morning, waking up and having breakfast. The sky was absolutely breathtaking. I have never in my whole life seen such a complete view of the sky. Looking up at that moment made me wish we had reached the summit at midnight. It was truly amazing.

Starting the hike was pretty easy. The first three hours breezed by, and soon the sun was up and we were approaching Trail Camp. Most hikers will hike from the portal to Trail Camp before making the final ascent up the mountain. Oh, but not us...we had to do it on one day!

<img alt="whitney3.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whitney3.jpg" width="275" height="367" class="imageleft" />Once I reached the Whitney zone (which required the permit) and Trail Camp, the switchbacks were pretty difficult. They weren't too frequent until beyond Trail Camp, where an endless parade of switchbacks eventually made me a very unhappy camper. At this point, my head was throbbing from the elevation, we were much higher than we were at Alta Peak (nearly 12,000 feet in elevation). I would have to stop at several points just to take a breather until the pounding subsided (which quickly reached its fevered pitch whenever I started the ascent again). I was pretty far ahead of the others (Laura quit early on but Tiffani and her boyfriend Ethan were still with me), but as the elevation had more of an effect on me, I had to slow down and hike with the group.

We reached Trail Crest, a feat in of itself, and we entered Sequoia National Park on the western side of the mountain. I thought we were nearly done, but the trail continued for another two grueling hours (but minus the switchbacks, thankfully. Just a steady steep grade, oh joy!) At times during this point, Tiffani and Ethan were far ahead of me, as the elevation wreaked havoc on my head. I caught up though.

After what seemed like forever, we finally reached the summit and I plopped myself on a rock and enjoyed some lunch. Some fearless birds came along and shared some of my lunch with me, it was pretty cool. But, as is all too true with hikes like this, reaching the top is only half of the story. The hike down was just brutal.

I reached the trail head at just after 8 p.m. (we reached the summit at 1 p.m. but didn't leave until 2 p.m.) The hike down was by far the worst part. I relied heavily on my filter water bottle since I had run completely out of bottled water. By the time I reached Trail Camp, I had so many blisters on my feet, but I knew resting every few hundred feet would only mean my blistered would get worse having to endure longer on the mountain, so I tore it up on the way down. I didn't care how much my feet hurt, I wanted to be off that mountain as quickly as possible. I was so relieved when I reached my car, I felt like bursting into tears, that's how significant the moment was.

So, having reflected on the hike, I feel confident in saying the hike was so much worse than running a marathon. Granted, it was only 22 miles, but you have no idea how long a hiking mile is until you've actually tried it. It's no picnic. Also, at least the marathon was over in 5 hours. If I have to spend 16 hours on a mountain more than 2 miles from a comfortable tent and sleeping bag ever again in my life, it will be too soon.

But, who am I kidding? I said I'd never run a marathon again, and just this week I resolved to run the inaugural Georgia Marathon with Marilia on March 25, 2007. Who knows, I may be taking a trip up Whitney next year.

If you feel up to it, do let me know.

Apologies for taking so long to write. I've been a very busy bee as far as running, last week I made it to 5 days. I took a nap today though, so maybe I will make it up with a Saturday run &#8212; we'll see. Even though my next marathon is over half a year away, I want to be in shape and prepared to start training...but more on that later.

<img alt="highsierra.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/highsierra.jpg" width="275" height="438" class="imageright" />Though I wish I could have seen it before I took on my own grueling 16-hour hike in the high Sierra, I watched <em>High Sierra</em> last week, a film noir staring none other than Humphrey Bogart. The movie was suggest to be my Jim Houck, our newspaper's city editor, but I had had my eye on it in the weeks leading to the Whitney hike. I didn't know much about it besides its suspenseful car chase up to Whitney portal, but any Bogie movie is worth checking out, I would venture to say.

The movie begins with Roy Earle, infamous crook and recently pardoned prisoner, being tapped for a big score. He agrees, drives across the country to sunny California (a trek I can identify with) and stops at Whitney Portal to meet with his associates. There, he meets the two men who will be working for him and also a young runaway Marie (Ida Lupino), a wide-eyed, wicked little woman who is smitten with Roy at the get go.

While casing the illustrious California resort they plan to swindle, Roy aids a family he had met earlier, along with their crippled daughter, Velma (Joan Leslie). Roy falls in love with Velma, and though she is in love with another man, Roy insists on financing the surgery that will grant her the freedom to walk and lead a normal life. After the procedure, Roy offers a sincere proposal to Velma, who soundly strikes it down, breaking his heart. Hurt, Roy returns to Marie and the boys to prepare for the job at hand.

Suffice to say, things do not go according to plan with the heist and soon the cops are onto Earle and Marie. While waiting for their cut from the score, Roy takes one last look at Velma following her recovery. She is engaged and sublimely happy, drunk and dismissive of Roy's lingering feelings, who leaves in a huff. Marie, loyal to Roy and curious of the other woman, provides comfort to Roy and intends to stick with him to the bitter end.

The movie is pretty dark, which I really liked. The way Earle gravitates toward Velma but soon finds himself fixed on Marie doesn't resound of that typical Hollywood romantic nonsense, which is probably what I enjoyed most about the film. Also, while planning the heist at Whitney Portal, Roy takes on an orphaned dog (Bogart's real-life pet at the time) which is said to be cursed, having its two previous owners die. The dog is fiercely loyal to Roy and offers a bit of levity to the film noir.

It's worth checking out, but I do make one suggestion: Don't watch it while throwing back shots of Malibu while entertaining a friend. Bogart is worth more than that.

It's been a while since I've had any "good news," so I thought I'd offer up something different for a little change of pace. I'm proud to say this comes from our very own Visalia Times-Delta.

<a href="http://visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060823/NEWS01/608230303/1002">Siblings admit to burying mother</a>
By David Castellon
Visalia Times-Delta

An autopsy has yet to verify whether the body of a woman found last week buried behind a Springville home is 91-year-old Acevia Crafts, but court records show that her children have told investigators it is their mother's body.

One of Acevia Crafts' three children, Addison Crafts, 56, admitted to a Tulare County sheriff's detective that he buried the body after she died in April of 2005 — and last week directed investigators to the spot, which he had covered with tires and fencing, the records state.

A sheriff's report containing this information was filed with the Tulare County Superior Court in the case of Addison Crafts and his two siblings, Arthur Crafts, 65, and Elaine Verna Crafts, 60, who stand accused of keeping their mother's death a secret in order to continue receiving her pension checks.

Over more than a year, those checks total about $15,000, according to documents filed with the court.</blockquote>

It's pretty sickening to conspire with your fellow siblings to pull some Weekend at Bernie's trick on your dead mother just so you can continuse to finance your rural home. I can't peg exactly which tragedy best suits this melodrama, but I have a feeling it's King Leer.

<blockquote>[The court document] goes on to say that Elaine Crafts claimed she was disabled and had no other income, so she was sure she would lose her mother's house without the pension income. Even so, the sheriff's report states that that the 10-acre property was going to be foreclosed for failure to pay taxes.

Court records show that somebody from the Teachers' Retirement System asked Tulare County Adult Protective Services to arrange a check on Acevia Crafts after a pension fund representative called Elaine Crafts and believed she sounded too alert and oriented to be somebody with Alzheimer's disease.

Authorities have accused Elaine Crafts of pretending to be her mother over the phone.

A deputy first went to the Crafts' house on July 27, but Arthur and Addison Crafts refused to let the deputy speak with their mother, a sheriff's report states. Another attempt was made the next day, but nobody answered the door.

On Wednesday of last week a deputy and social worker from Adult Protective Services showed up at the house.

"Arthur [Crafts] went inside the residence, then returned holding a telephone. He told [the social worker] she could speak to Acevia over the phone," according to the Sheriff's report.

After the social worker insisted on seeing Acevia Crafts personally, she was allowed in, and a woman behind a partially open bedroom door claimed to be Acevia.

The social worker later told deputies that even with her limited view, the woman behind the door didn't appear to be old enough, so she "asked the woman to open the door so he could see her. The woman admitted to being Elaine."</blockquote>

Priceless...those guys are real winners.

I always thought that Angelina Jolie was like a modern-day Helen of Troy. She's so beautiful, and it is almost destiny that Paris (in this case Brad Pitt) abducts her and makes her his forever.

Well, all that aside, <i>guess</i> who looks like Angelina Jolie (according to some silly computer analysis). Me!

<a href="http://www.myheritage.com" title="Click here to create your own Celebrity Collage on MyHeritage - best site for your family tree and photos" alt="Click here to create your own Celebrity Collage on MyHeritage - best site for your family tree and photos" target="_blank"><img src="http://69.93.254.120/F/storage/site1/files/61/35/6135_16342f3f1f4430tafc18.jpg" width="500" height="574" border="0" ></a>

I always knew I was beautiful. I'm waiting for my Trojan to come wisk me away. I'm sure that Trojan will be here any day now...

Well, having checked another goal for the year off my list (climbing Mt. Whitney), it's time to look ahead. I know I have resolved to running the inaugural Georgia Marathon, but that's like months away. I can't even start seriously training for it until November (which, damn, is so much sooner than I think, you know?) For now, I'm so looking forward to my next vacation...

<img alt="eiffeltower.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/eiffeltower.jpg" width="275" height="367" class="imageright" />On September 16, on what will be a grueling, unpleasant day, I will be flying to Paris, France. I've been meaning to do this for so long! Almost a year and a half ago, when I was visiting my expatriate friend Nicole in Marietta, Ga., I promised her that that summer I would go to see her Angers, France. Sadly, my search for a job went on a bit longer than I had hoped, so I had to nix the trip for that year. Since I am happily employed and have a second week of vacation to spare (my first week was spent seeing friends and family in Georgia), I am going to Europe!

It's not going to be one of those frou-frou trips you might be thinking about. While I will be spending some time in Paris, I will be mostly hanging out with Nicole in Orleans, which is not very far south of Paris. We've been exchanging e-mails and I'm getting more and more pumped about my trip. The last time I saw her, over a pitcher of margaritas at Taco Mac, I promised to enjoy some fine French hops with her (I am not a fan of beer so she will have the opportunity of deflowering me). That's really all I have in mind to accomplish while I'm visiting, but I'm sure she has some ideas for me as well.

I have been ruing the day of my departure, how exactly I'm supposed to get to San Francisco at 8 a.m. has confounded me. I know I can just park in long-term parking, but that's not very appealing to me. A coworker has offered to take me along with her to catch my flight but I may have to take a train back to Visalia. It's kind of exciting...

So yah, just to say what's next for me, it's France! A whole week in France. I'll be sure to post photos and chime in now and then (God knows I won't be able to work a phone card). Au revoir!

I just got through watching an excellent film noir. It's always a great feeling I get when I've just finished a good movie. It's like the time I finished <em>Casablanca</em>, <em>Rear Window</em> and <em>Vertigo</em> &#8212; all for the first time. The film was thoroughly entertaining. I only hope my next film noir is as good as this one.

<img alt="doubleindemnity.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/doubleindemnity.jpg" width="275" height="421" class="imageright" />For my first film noir minus the patronage of my favorite actor, Humphrey Bogart, I opted for <em>Double Indemnity</em> &#8212; released just last week on DVD for the first time. In fact, the movie has been sitting at the bottom of my queue for months. I added it shortly after watching <em>The Big Sleep</em> for the second time, when I got that craving for a new film noir. I thought maybe they lost all the DVDs or something, but thankfully it made it to my house today and I couldn't want to take the DVD for a spin.

In case you didn't know, double indemnity is an instance where an insurance company will pay double in case of accidental death. Knowing this, you can surmise that <em>Double Indemnity</em> involves just about the sexiest subject in Hollywood: insurance fraud. Oh boy, it does, and you can bet your whole claim that it's sexy. The film stars Fred MacMurray as the lusty insurance salesman Walter Neff, who is struck by femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson (beautifully played by the sexy Barbara Stanwyck).

The story is very dark, obviously. Phyllis is unhappy with her husband, Mr. Dietrichson, and Neff sees a chance to score the dame and a cash payout. By pawning off an accident policy on Mr. Dietrichson before he takes a trip to Palo Alto traveling by train (an instance in which accidental death results in double indemnity), Phyllis and Neff set him up for murder. But, as you can imagine, no murder is perfect.

Neff soon finds his murder plot unraveling as his boss, Barton Keyes (played by the film legend Edward G. Robinson), quickly smells a fink. Uncovering inconsistencies that seemed so trivial to Walter before the plot, Keyes soon has a noose around Phyllis' neck and the neck of <em>some other guy</em>, an accomplice Keyes knows is involved. The pressure is on for Neff, who realizes all too soon how rotten he's become, even though Phyllis was always a step ahead.

It's a fabulous film and anyone who is up for a saucy jaunt through the mind of a seedy insurance salesman, look no further than <em>Double Indemnity</em>. It's enough to make you look twice before signing that policy with your significant other's pen.

<blockquote><strong>Phyllis:</strong> We're both rotten.<br>
<strong>Walter Neff:</strong> Only you're a little more rotten.</blockquote>

Since last week, the city of Visalia has been terrorized by vicious, man-eating reptiles! Well, it's not quite that bad, but after getting my hair cut the other day and speaking to some of my fellow city-dwellers, the snake and lizard that have been on the loose might as well have been man-eating:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060902/NEWS01/609020336/1002">Lizard compounds neighbors' reptile fears</a><br>
By David Castellon<br>
Staff writer

Residents in a south Visalia neighborhood who have spent the past week nervously looking out for a venomous snake that may be slithering through homes and gardens have a new reptile to worry about.

On Thursday, city officials announced that they had confirmed that a two-foot monitor lizard had escaped from its cage in the same neighborhood where last week it was reported that a dog might have been bitten by a venomous snake.

"The owners of the reptile confirmed that the lizard had been missing a couple of weeks ago and had been captured and returned to its cage, but has now been missing again for several days," said Leslie Caviglia, Visalia's assistant city manager, in a statement.

It goes on to say that the lizard, seen by a police officer, had a "snake-like head and a long, narrowing tail" and that city officials have been told that the lizard's bite could contain bacteria that can cause septic shock and death if untreated.</blockquote>

While none of this foolishness is happening in my neighborhood, I'm just a few blocks away, but I'm not scared. I mean, the lizard and the snake would have to cross a lot of streets to even get close to me, and I'm sure they would be road kill if they even tried.

I tell you what, though, this snake is not something you want to mess with:

<blockquote>[Brendon Mitchell, owner of the Venomous Snake Research Center in Tehachapi], was in Visalia earlier this week helping city Animal Control officers search for the snake.

"They asked if we needed any help in finding the snake, and they said they were experts in doing that, and they said they would help if we let them," said Jerry Herrmann, executive director of the Valley Oak Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which provides animal control services for Visalia. "I said, 'Y'all come. We need all the help we can get.' "

But Mitchell said the search was unsuccessful.

"We didn't come across much of anything. We came across some tracks that could have been a snake, but we weren't sure," because somebody had stepped on them, he said.

Meanwhile, rumors have spread fast and furious about the snake, including that it is a black mamba, one of the world's deadliest snakes.</blockquote>

<img alt="blackmamba.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/blackmamba.jpg" width="275" height="382" class="imageright" />I think it's positively thrilling that a black mamba would be on the loose in Visalia. Of course we've all seen Kill Bill and know just how deadly a black mamba can be.

<blockquote><b>Elle Driver</b>: "In Africa, the saying goes 'In the bush, an elephant can kill you, a leopard can kill you, and a black mamba can kill you. But only with the mamba is death sure.' Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate.'" Pretty cool, huh?</blockquote>

I don't know where they got the idea that a black mamba would be on the loose, but our newspaper has been pretty hush-hush on any references to Beatrix Kiddo, the deadly assasin from the film with the nickname "black mamba," as she is considered the deadliest woman in the world.

It's one of my favorite movies, but considering the venom of an actual black mamba can kill you in a matter of hours (or minutes, if bitten on the face), I don't think I'm going to be reaching into any bushes around Caldwell Avenue and County Center Street. You know, just to be safe.

But no worries, at least one of the reptiles has been found!

<blockquote><a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060901/NEWS01/609010330&SearchID=73255632831025">Lizard caught; snake still loosed</a><br>
By Jed Chernabaeff<br>
Staff writer

Tension in a south Visalia neighborhood was relieved temporarily Friday afternoon when a 2-foot monitor lizard reported missing just a day before was captured by a gardener.

But nerves are still on edge in the neighborhood, as a venomous snake, who animal control officials say may be linked to the killing of a dog after biting it weeks ago, could still be on the loose.

Visalia gardener Ken Peterson said the Savannah monitor lizard, named Steve-O, was crawling on sun-baked pavement while he was driving east in the 2700 block of James Street, near where it was reported to have escaped.
Ken Peterson said a neighborhood resident first spotted the lizard and flagged Peterson down.

"The neighbor spotted the lizard and called 911," Peterson said. "I drove up, and the lizard ran toward the curb toward a tube."

The tube, a drain pipe along the base of a 2-foot wooden fence between two homes, served as the device to trap the lizard, Peterson said.

<center><img alt="lizard.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/lizard.jpg" width="350" height="287" /></center>

"I stuck two sticks on each side of the pipe and trapped it," Peterson said. "Then we waited for police and animal control."</blockquote>

I would have probably left the lizard alone. I mean, he's going to find the black mamba eventually and then the two would have it out, and the victor would become legendary nightmare reptile of southwest Visalia.

That, or they should loose some mongoose to look out for the snake. I'm sure Rikki-Tikki-Tavi would down Beatrix in no time!

I know, it's so unlike me to be self-aggrandizing, right? I have been meaning to get to it all summer, but it has been over a year since I've had a bone fide Web site. Granted, this little place came about because I wanted to have a blog again, but it's so insignificant. I am capable of so much more.

Well, I'm happy to say that this morning I finally got off my toushie and put something together that has gone surprisingly smoothly. I'm so excited about it, I think I will likely have it ready before I take off to Paris for a week (which is coming up in just less than two weeks from now!)

The site will consist of mostly this blog. Past Web sites I've done have been pretty personal, and though I will link to those sites, I want to continue in the direction this site is going in. I think the content is so much better than what I used to churn out.

There will also be links to my online portfolio of work and information on hiring me to build a Web page of your very own. Stay tuned! Hopefully I won't be so crazy busy with running and packing that I will have something together very soon.

I've been pretty busy this last week. On the behest of the newspaper, I took upon myself my second Flash project: <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/news/multimedia/miracleleague.swf">"Miracle on the diamond": The Miracle League of Visalia</a>. It was my first reporting assignment for the newspaper. Though the emphasis for me was the audio and Flash editing, the most intimidating part of the assignment was actually going on location and getting the story. I have to say, despite my reservations, it went really well.

The Miracle League of Visalia is a baseball league for special-needs kids that plays twice a year, 16 weeks a year. The organizers of the program were inspired by the first Miracle League established in Conyers, Ga., which they learned about from a segment on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel. I watched the video in preparation for my interview, and it was pretty inspiring. 

These kids spend their whole lives sequestered from the rest of the world, denied living a normal childhood just because they are different. The Miracle League makes it possible for special-needs kids to play baseball on their own teams.

I was so inspired by the men and women who make something like this possible. The man responsible was so humble, he asked me specifically that his actions not be played prominently in the presentation and that the focus remain on these amazing athletes. I tried my very best to make that possible and I believe I produced a fine presentation. It is a vast improvement on the Mt. Whitney presentation, as I was able to include the navigation buttons. I hope you enjoy!

As far as the Web site, I have been working on it on and off this week. The blog is completely prepared and all I must do is prepare the auxiliary pages that will include my portfolio and past Web sites. It looks very cool, I can't wait to publish it. You can expect it on Thursday night, hopefully.

And in less than a week, I will be in France! I will post something about that later. Oh, and running is going fabulous, though I have to run a day early this week. Friday is going to be insanely busy...and don't get me started about Saturday. I will spend about 10 hours on the ground the whole day!

It's been a few weeks, and our slithering friend is still at large. The community remains on a heightened alert &#8212; the black mamba may strike at any moment.

<blockquote><a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060915/NEWS01/609150310/1002">Residents nervous about snake</a><br />
By David Castellon<br />
Staff writer<br />

Dixie Chapman doesn't feel all that comfortable walking out of her south Visalia home.

Outside, she looks warily at bushes and rocks and even glances up at the trees to see if a venomous snake might be there ready to strike. It has gotten so bad that the normally meticulous lawn in front of her home sits thick with overgrown grass, and fear of a snake has made her and her husband reluctant of get out and tend to their gardening.

"We're just still being cautious," she said, and so are several residents in the 3800 block of South Woodland Drive and the surrounding blocks. They have been on edge for the past three weeks, ever since they learned a neighbor's dog may have been bitten by a venomous snake.</blockquote>

The paper is really digging at the obvious question on everyone's mind: Was there ever a snake at all?

<blockquote>That can be traced back to a series of events that began a couple of weeks before the dog died.

One of the owners of the dog, an Australian shepherd and Queensland mix named Casey, said that some time in early August she was in the backyard of her Woodland Street home when some of her dogs became agitated about something behind a storage shed, and one let out a big yelp.

The woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she caught a quick glance of something either in one of her dogs' mouths, or it had clamped its mouth on the dog's snout.

"I saw the head," something reptilian with slick scales and dark eyes and possibly a couple of inches of a reptile body, she said, adding that whatever it was fell in thick grass and disappeared.

"I can't be sure it was a lizard," the woman said, adding that she's about 70 percent sure it was some sort of snake. ...

As best as she could remember, the woman said, what she saw most looked like a brown snake or a black mamba, with the mamba — one of the world's deadliest snakes — looking the most like what she remembered.

What happened next isn't clear. Residents of the neighborhoods reported hearing stories that a neighbor had lost a pet black mamba, somebody had seen a snake slithering up a tree and other sightings.</blockquote>

<img alt="kiddo.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/kiddo.jpg" width="300" height="189" class="imageleft" />Ok, there are so many problems with this whole "black mamba" theory. I've woken up in a terror, convinced that black widow spiders were crawling on my window shades and walls, but that doesn't mean they were actually there. All it means is I have an overactive imagination and I think this spineless, anonymous woman does as well. What does 70% add up to anyways in this Valley town anyways?

And &#8212; come on &#8212; snake slithering up trees? I've seen black mambas do a lot (slaughter the Crazy 88s, offer Lucy Lui a free hair cut, remove whatever that thing was in Daryl Hannah's eye), but I don't think they can slither up trees. Crawl out of the grave, maybe...

I imagine in another two weeks David will have to update this story again, and the SPCA will continue to perform this stupid charade, failing to admit that they were just wrong about the stupid snake.

Meanwhile, on a grassy knoll, in the Sierra foothills perhaps, a loosed black mamba snake is laughing at all the stupid humans.

So I'm down to my last few hours in Visalia before my trip. I am not getting any sleep tonight. I mean, it's already Saturday in France right now anyways, I might as well get used to it, right?

I so much more excited about the trip now than I was a few hours ago. I guess I've been focusing so much on the arduous trip to and from France that I haven't given much thought to the actual week I will spend there. It is still wholly a mystery to me. I only just an hour ago planned my return hotel accomodations, transportation, train and car ride home. If I can make it to that international flight in Philadelphia tomorrow night in one piece, I will be very happy.

I had a bit of a scare this week, though. Nicole has kept up with me pretty well while I've been planning my trip. We had a communication breakdown last weekend, however. I was nervously pacing before heading out to cover the Miracle League last Saturday when I decided to send Nicole a detailed e-mail concerning the trip. I checked my e-mail that night, Sunday and Monday &#8212; no word. I asked her to call me a few weeks before the trip, but I received no call whatsoever from her! Had she forgotten? Surely not. Was she trying to blow me off for some unknown reason? I know Nicole, and she wouldn't do that...but you never know. This is how disasters happen!

Well, it turns out that moving to Orleans has thrown her world topsy-turvy, so she didn't have constant access to the Internet like I do. She did get back to me Wednesday morning, thankfully, and now I am in the know.

As I wait to disembark and put a close to my final state-side entry of my trip, I want to share one humorous thing I came across tonight. In light of recent foiled terrorist plots in Britain, I can't bring my water bottle and toothpaste on the plane with me. But what about sleeping-pill gel caps? I went to the Transportation Security Administration Web site and luckily 4 ounces of unprescribed medication is allowed on the flight to carry on. But that's not all that's allowed...

Seems like Uncle Sam permits 4 ounces of personal lubricant on the plane too. I'm not sure a cadre of terrorists could bring a nation to its knees with a small bottle of KY Jelly (but I know a few guys that wouldn't mind bending over). It's good to know anyone looking to squeeze into the mile-high club will be able to do so comfortably without it being too much of a pain in the ass.

OK, enough vulgarity, that's it! Leave comments and/or well wishes! I will update on my trip when I can (assuming they have Internet in France). I hear they aren't that far behind the times, so updates are very likely &#8212; so tune in!

Au revoir!

Greetings from France. I'm not certain when this will reach the world wide web, but I am writing it anyways. It's Monday night now at 10:56. I have been in France for almost two days now, and it's fabulous!

I am not taking the tourist route this time around. Staying with Nicole in Orléans has been a great experience. Seeing the people of France go about their normal, day-to-day lives is very interesting. It's nice to see how a whole different world behaves. Also, I must admit, French people are so attractive and dress very nicely. I told this to Alain, Nicole's boyfriend this morning when we were preparing to pick her up from the University...I'm not sure he got the compliment. I guess high fashion is just the minimum.

<img alt="cathedral.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/cathedral.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="imageleft"/>We went to a large cathedral today &#8212; requisite of any trip to France it seems. It was very beautiful (made me a little proud to at least have some tacit understanding of a higher power unlike <em>some</em> atheist French people I know). I said a prayer, lit and candle and awed over the exquisite surroundings. A kind old Frenchman approached us and shared some of the history of the Cathedral. Apparently, when the structure was being built, Joan of Arc used to pray at the site when it still was an old Roman Christian chapel. Joan of Arc apparently liberated England's siege of Orléans in 9 days. She still has a strong presence in Orléans.

I think tomorrow will be more low key than today was. I'm sure Nicole has many more classes to attend. She's in law school of course! We are going running early in the morning and I'm aching for a good jaunt. Any excuse to see some more sexy French men...

Bonjour from France! This is actually my second entry since my vacation has started, but since Nicole practically lives in the dark ages, without Internet, this is the first time I will actually be able to post something to my blog.

<img alt="class.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/class.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="imageright"/>Well, I'm alive and well. My time in France so far has been very restful and pleasant. I arrived in Paris early Sunday and made my way to Orleans to meet up with Nicole. Orleans is a fabulous city and I am very happy to know that such a small town can still be very vibrant and interesting (unlike certain Valley cities I know).

Right now, Nicole is plugging away in some boring French class and I'm in the university library on the Internet. Ah, precious Internet...you have no idea how annoying it has been trying to pick through world events with my limited understanding of French while watching the evening news. This morning, for example, I figured the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had addressed the United Nations, but I had no idea what he said. They even dubbed ol' Dubya in French and I couldn't overhear what he was saying in plain English. Also, The screen kept scrolling this text "Thai PM declares state of emergency" and "Tanks surround compound of Thai PM," but the newscaster would never elaborate on the story. How frustrating...

I've been kicking around the idea of going to Paris tomorrow by myself, but I still am not sure I'm ready to take the plunge. I think it would be good for me and would give Nicole and Alain a break from babysitting me (though it is nice to have the flat to myself for a nice nap -- this is my vacation after all! The past two mornings I have been up to run with Nicole, and boy is she fast! The first day it was like a 30-minute sprint, I could hardly keep up! Today I could tell she slowed down for me...I was really hoping to school her too. I guess I still have a lot of training to do.

<img alt="joan.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/joan.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="imageleft"/>As for the rest of the week, Friday I will probably go shopping with Nicole. I have been so impressed with the beautiful French people and how wonderfully they dress. I think the era of the T-shirt has ended for me, I really need to learn to dress with more style. Hopefully Nicole can help me out.

I should also note that I have really enjoyed the French food Nicole and Alain have treated me to. Every day, for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Nicole has prepared exciting, inventive and delicious meals. Every day at noon, it is a tradition for the French to have a hearty lunch. From Nicole's flat in Orleans, you can hear the cathedral bell ring at noon every day and watch the school children scurry home for this very important meal. 

Unlike American meals, French meals traditionally come in courses. At first, I thought Alain and Nicole were throwing a bunch of food at me because they thought I was hungry. At the end of the meal I finally realized it was all part of the tradition. Most meals start of with a sort of appetizer. Today, Nicole and I had steamed zucchini and French bread. For the entree, we had pasta with tomato sauce and cheese -- delicious. And for dessert, Nicole had some cheese and a nectarine and I enjoyed an apple. Every meal has been like this and the three of us usually spend an hour together talking and enjoying the meal.

Well, apologies that I have no pictures yet. Sort of a technical problem I explained earlier but will post later. I will be sure to posthumously color up this entry, but for now this is what you've got. I will try to post again later this week. Thanks for the well wishes, I will see you all soon!

<img alt="eiffel2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/eiffel2.jpg" width="300" height="400" class="imageleft"/>Bon voyage! I am on the train from the Orleans train station, Les Aubrais Orléans, and headed to la Gare d'Austerlitz...I think. It's hard to tell, of course, but I'm sure that's where I'm going. I've just left Nicole and it was very sad to depart. I had a fabulous time being with my friend and seeing just a glimmer of her life in France. I know that if Nicole was in America, I would be in constant contact, and I'm glad that I was able to at least see her in France since I cannot see her often in America.

The past few days have been pretty incredible. I knew that I would regret not taking the oportunity to explore Paris so I was sure not to neglect seizing upon that this Thursday. Originally, the intent of all this was for Nicole to be out of classes and for the two of us to spend as much time possible exploring France or just cavorting around Angers. Her sudden move to Orléans changed that so my vacation became a more subdued, leisurly habitation of Orléans accented by Nicole's companionship and wonderful cooking.

I'm glad things worked out this way. My vacation to Georgia several months ago was so rushed, I had almost no time to relax (with the exception of the one night I got to stay at the Hotel Mary-Kate). I'm glad I got to spend time in Orléans exploring and taking it easy. Since Nicole was in class on Thursday for most of the day and I didn't want to have to tag along (sitting through French Administrative Law is pretty damn boring, especially if you don't know French), so I took the train to Paris.

I was scared at first. It was the first time I had ever traveled by myself in a foreign city. I'm so glad I seized the opportunity because I had a wonderful time. I enjoyed myself most shopping by the Arc de Triomphe. I got a Louis Vutton bag for Melinda as I promised and was able to replace my camera's memory card. I got some fabulous photos walking through Paris, by the Louvre and on the way to the Eiffel Tower.

<center><img alt="eiffel1.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/eiffel1.jpg" width="400" height="215" /></center>

Standing beneath the Eiffel tower, I was of course tempted to make the ascent. It was sort of a spiritual calling &#8212; I remember the first time I topped the Eiffel tower when I last visited Paris about six years ago (pictured above). I felt so excited and awed by the experience. I couldn't pass it up this time around so I spent the 11 Euros for the timeless thrill. 

Afterward, as I had used up all of my Paris time, I had to scoot back to Austerlitz and head back to Orléans just in time to miss dinner. It was worth it though. I'm glad I went. Had I listened to my inhibitions, I probably would have stayed in Orléans, too fearful of making the solo trip. It was a great thing for me and by the end of the day, when ever a silly Parisian came to talk to me in French, I didn't even sweat saying, "Oh, I don't speak French." In fact, I probably looked more Parisian than ever. Well, maybe...

Long flight ahead, I'll write again about the trip after I've arrived in San Francisco. Au revoir!

Apologies on not posting like any photos from France. I mean, I've only even done one entry of the four I've actually written about it. It took like 36 hours just to get back to California so give me a few days to put something together. I promise it will be substantive and fabulous.

I'm still "unpacking" from my trip to France. This week is kind of hectic. I'll be sure to post my entries with photos, whatever. I'm taking my time, so sue me. This week I'm also retreating from one half of my apartment. This weekend my friend Natalie is moving in. It should make home life much more interesting (Malibu every night!)

But I thought this was funny:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/dekalb/stories/2006/09/25/0925metyarn.html">Yarn thief gets year in jail</a><br />
<strong>By Charles Yoo<br />
Atlanta Journal-Constitution</strong>

<img alt="yarn.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/yarn.jpg" width="300" height="240" class="imageright" />A woman prosecutors called a serial yarn thief will spend a year in jail after pleading guilty to shoplifting Monday in DeKalb County.

Audrey Yandel, a 70-year-old Atlanta grandmother and a retired nurse, has been convicted 12 times in the past two decades, mostly for stealing yarn, according to DeKalb Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney John Melvin.

In the DeKalb cases, Yandel was caught stealing yarn at a Decatur shop in January 2005 and knitting needles at a Dunwoody business in May 2006.

Her attorney, Charles Pekor, said she's been suffering from "compulsive behavior disorder" and has been seeking psychiatric help.

After serving a year in jail, Yandel will be placed on probation for six years. She's now forbidden from entering any specialty store that sells yarn.</blockquote>

Where do you send a 70-year-old serial yarn thief? And, I'm sorry, but is this lady really a menace to society? I hope they stick her in a nice padded prison &#8212; strictly polyester, no cotton.

Lately I have been sort of burned out on Netflix. Instead of hastily watching a movie when I come home and hurriedly taking it to the mailbox the next day, I sort of carelessly hold onto my movies and return them whenever I feel up to it. I suppose that's the way it should be, but to at least liven up my desire to watch engaging film, I have been putting some of my most favorite movies on my queue &#8212; movies I sadly do not own, at least not now.

<img alt="dimanche.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/dimanche.jpg" width="300" height="400" class="imageright" />Today I watched <em>Un long dimanche de fiançailles</em>, A French film from one of my most favorite directors, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who also directed possibly my most favorite film, <em>Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain</em>. Unlike <em>Amélie</em>, <em>Un long dimanche de fiançailles</em> (Or <em>A Very Long Engagement</em> as it is known to American audiences) is much more somber and serious. It is set in France following World War I.

The movie begins following the war, in which Mathilde holds hopelessly onto her belief that her fiancé, Manech, somehow survived his death sentence for self-mutilation, though he has not returned home for almost three years. Mathilde hires a private detective and enlists her family and friends to find out all they can about the circumstances of Manech's death outside of the trench curiously named Bingo Crépuscule.

Manech, having been shot in the hand, is accused of self-mutilation in hopes to return home to Mathilde. Along with four other men who have committed similar acts, Manech and the others are sent over the trench to fend for themselves in no man's land, effectively ensuring their demise. They survive longer than most but according to military reports, they were all found dead. However, Mathilde uncovers stories that seem to suggest a man wearing German boots made it out with another wounded soldier. She holds onto the very slim hope that her Manech is that hurt man.

The movie is very difficult to understand, even with subtitles. I watched it for the first time a year ago when I was living with my mother and grandmother in Ohio. I could hardly understand how the story weaved through the tales of the five men sent into no man's land, but I followed pretty well this time around. It's important to pay close attention to the details of the men's lives and most especially their names. It's always more difficult for me to remember a French name than a traditional American one, so that's probably why I have more trouble.

I won't say much more about the film. All I can say is that no other film I have ever watched has made me cry, except this one. Even a year later, knowing the conclusion of the film, I can't help but cry. It's exhilarating to watch a film that has such an effect on me. I hope that someone else somewhere might feel the same way.

As far as the France stuff, I swear it will be done soon. I just got my photos off of my phone so I should be putting everything together soon. The entries are done I just need to edit them. Blah blah...plus I have a lot of cleaning to do today, so I better get to work. It's sure to be the next thing I post.

Today was a rough day. My grandfather died today. I'm sorry I haven't posted in a while. I'm sorry I haven't posted links to my complete Web site. I'm bad. It's been bad.

Some of the France posts are up. I have pictures <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aliensexfiend/sets/72157594312998403/">here</a>. I'm sorry, but this week is kind of complicated. It's been kind of rough. I had a lot of wine tonight because, I don't know. I've been watching "The Body," an episode of Buffy. It's sad.

I'm going to Reno tomorrow probably. I'm not sure what to think about it. Leave me a message, that would be nice.

Anyways, I have to think of something else, like sleep or running. I like to sleep and run.

Good-night.

Sorry about that stupid idiotic thing I posted last night. My grandfather did pass away yesterday and it was very troubling, but I should point out I am at peace about it. I'm am doing just fine (I had just a bit too much wine and I watched a depressing episode of Buffy).

By the grace of God, I actually spoke to him yesterday. I hadn't spoken to him since I visited in May this year. I told him about my marathon that I ran in June and also my grueling hike up Mt. Whitney in August. He used to live in California so he was aware of the mountain. I told him I loved him and that I would be coming back to Georgia in March to run the Georgia Marathon and I was looking forward to seeing him. That's not going to happen but I find I cannot feel bad about it. It's incredible that I spoke to him the day he died and I was able to make peace with him and tell him that I loved him. It's truly incredible.

I'm in Reno this week and I will post some pictures later. I had a bad sinus headache coming over the Sierra today. My coworkers made fun of my ravings for veggie dogs (don't ask why the subject of my vegetarianism came up in conversation, it always seems to be a hot topic). Tomorrow is going to be a long day and I may do some gambling tomorrow evening. I won't win anything, but what the hey, I can try.

Thanks for your kind words, I'm doing just fine. I loved my grandfather, but he is in a better place. I may be going to his funeral at Arlington Cemetery, so maybe I will reflect on him then. Right now, I am just still absorbing it. But I'm doing just fine (I just need to stay away from my computer as well as my cell phone if I decide to have a lot of wine again).

Good night (what did people think of my France pictures?? They are <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aliensexfiend/sets/72157594312998403/">here</a>, go see them!)

It's hard to believe, but I have been a Californian for a year now. A year ago today I pulled my car up to my new apartment after a week of driving across America. I left my mother, grandmother and Joey in Miamisburg, Ohio and for four days made my way across Interstate 70 to the great state of California. It was an exhilarating experience, one I had been waiting on for so long. I wanted so much after graduation to go some place new and different. Fulfilling that goal was a terrific rush.

A year later, I'm still in the Valley. My apartment is so much more than just the exhumed contents of my packed car and the futon I assembled on my first night in my new apartment. I am so much more than that green, young copy editor from Georgia. I have accomplished so much since I've arrived here. 

In just one year, I have bought furniture and things for my apartment, trained and completed a marathon, climbed the tallest mountain in the state and even fulfilled my promise to my good friend Nicole and made it all the way to France. I'm so thankful for the opportunities afforded to my since I got my job. I feel I have purpose and direction which a year ago were things I desperately sought. My life here is invigorating and I look forward to what the next year has to offer.

A year from now, I hope things will be very different. My goal is to apply to graduate school in the fall with an assistantship at a school in California or hopefully in Washington D.C. or New York (two places I have dreamed to have lived). Before I do that, though, I hope to achieve more in New Media at my newspaper. On the Saturday after Thanksgiving, I will begin training for my next marathon, the Georgia Marathon on March 25 in Atlanta, Ga., which I will be running with my friend Marilia. I am also ironing out the details of a trip to Las Vegas with my friend Jeremy to see our fabulous friend Padmini and visit the hallowed landmark The Cheetah, where they filmed the film classic "Showgirls." I'm going back to Ohio early this January to see my mother and grandmother. I may also be going to see Jeremy in Ann Arbor, Mich., next year.

Apologies, setting goals like this keeps me motivated and keeps things interesting. Like I said, I accomplished so much this last year, and if I hadn't laid out so much I probably would have just wasted away in the boring Central Valley.

Well, before I go, I thought it might be interesting to share my iTunes Top 25 Most Played playlist over the past year. Here it is:

These are the moments you want to savor. You wish time would stop so you could live them over and over again:

<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/us/04pastorcnd.html?hp&ex=1162616400&en=808cf25dcc9ce1a9&ei=5094&partner=homepage">Evangelical leader says he bought drugs</a></b><br>
By John Holusha and Neela Banerjee<br>
New York Times

<img alt="haggard.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/haggard.jpg" width="216" height="282" class="imageright" />The Rev. Ted Haggard, the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals and one of the nation’s most influential Christian leaders, admitted today that he had purchased the illegal drug methamphetamine from a gay escort in Denver, but denied that he ever had sex with the man.

Mr. Haggart resigned as president of the evangelical association and stepped aside as senior pastor of the New Life mega-church in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Thursday after Michael Forest Jones, a self-described former gay prostitute, accused him of having a sexual affair for three years and using the drug, commonly known as crystal meth, during those encounters.</blockquote>

Though the story is throughly lurid and very damning for evangelicals, I was very pessimistic about its truthfulness. The man who is leveling the allegations is a male prostitute and we are merely four days from an election. And his explanation as to why he's coming forward now is not convincing:

<blockquote>"People may look at me and think what I've done is immoral, but I think I had to do the moral thing in my mind and that is expose someone who is preaching one thing and doing the opposite behind everybody's back," said Jones.</blockquote>

OK, I get the whole "doing the moral thing," but he cashed the checks, took the cash for years! I guess it's only immoral in an election year (But even if that were true, it seems like it would have been much more immoral in 2004, considering what was at stake). I'm sure we'll take what we can get, though.

Despite all the questions, this whole situation is freaking awesome. You can't tell me this guy just took a massage from the prostitute and tossed the meth. He was so having sex with the guy, and he's one of the most important evangelicals in the entire country. He talks the the President and his advisers every Monday! This is huge. This is better than Christmas! I can't wait to see what happens.

I know all the most popular blogs are posting it, but I just had to do it. It's from my soon-to-be-favorite documentary, Jesus Camp, about crazed evangelicals. You have to watch the <a href="http://www.jesuscampthemovie.com/">trailer</a>.

Just when you thought a tripping evangelical preacher having gay sex with a prostitute was as good as it gets ... something like this comes across the wire.

<blockquote><b>Naked man arrested with concealed weapon</b><br>
The Associated Press

EL CERRITO, Calif. — A naked man was arrested on suspicion of carrying a concealed weapon after telling police he had a screwdriver in his buttocks.

The man was lying on a tree stump masturbating beside a nature path near the El Cerrito Bay Area Rapid Transit station Thursday, police said.

John Sheehan, 33, of Pittsburg was initially arrested on suspicion of indecent exposure. But when asked if he was carrying anything police should know about, Sheehan mentioned the tool, said El Cerrito Detective Cpl. Don Horgan.

"You can't get much more concealed than that," Horgan said.

Officers drew their weapons and firefighters were called to the scene, but Sheehan removed a 6-inch metal awl wrapped in black electrical tape without incident.

Sheehan, who was paroled from state prison last week, was then booked into the county jail in Martinez on suspicion of parole violations, indecent exposure and one felony count of possessing a concealed weapon.

"When you're talking about an awl or an ice pick and you're dealing with somebody who's fresh out of prison, it's a weapon. That's a stabbing instrument," Horgan said.

He noted that the rear end is a common hiding place for weapons being smuggled into prison.

It was not immediately clear what Sheehan was on parole for.</blockquote>

When the nutgraf of an AP story contains the words "naked" and "masturbation", you know it's got to be interesting. At work this evening, I came up with the perfect subhead for the headline.

<b>Headline:</b> Naked man arrested with concealed weapon

Apologies for being a little short with the film picks. I can't believe the last Netflix film I highlighted was <em>Un long dimanche de fiançailles</em>, and I had already seen it. I think this week I'll be doing something on <em>All About Eve</em>, the excellent celluloid precursor to the <em>Showgirls</em>.

For now, enjoy this YouTube clip of a scene from <em>Beetlejuice</em>, which had me and my coworkers laughing. I don't know how that movie popped in my head, but you've got to love Tim Burton. Enjoy:

It's that time again. Midterm elections. And this is the biggest midterm election. Well, since the last one.

Everyone in Washington is going nuts over this election. It's been on all the pundits minds since the first few days of January 2006 — hell, even the first few hours on Wednesday, November 3, 2004, the day after the last national election.

One thing that I have noticed in the past two years is the media's obsession with the Democrats and their supposed return to power. Since the beginning of this year, after Republicans lost traction on their legislative agenda in 2005, the Democrats fared well in the offterm election and the response to Hurricane Katrina sowed discontent in the minds of the electorate, the media has framed this election in favor of the Democrats. I credit this with the prevailing conception that Republicans will be on the defensive on election day.

After being burned two-straight years in a row, I'm not going to be duped this time around. I believe that the Democrats will make gains on election day, and they may retake the House of Representatives, but they will not pull off a "blue coup." Election Day will be a victory for some Democrats, but it will always be a stark reminder of the voting power of the Republican majority that has twice in recent memory relegated Democrats to second string.

Think about it. After the 2002 midterm election, Democrats lost two Senate seats, dropping from 50 seats to 48. In 2004, the election proved even worse for Democrats, when their minority was widdled from 48 to 44 seats. Now, Democrats are carrying on about how they may be in striking distance of a Democrat majority in the Senate. I find that hard to believe.

After two election cycles — straight losses for Democrats — do they really expect to be handed Congress on a platter? As crucial as this election is to Democrats, President Bush and his miserable failure of a war in Iraq are not on the ballot. Local politicians from across the country are, and they exist in microcosms that are often very different from the national debate that rages in our country. Democrats will fare better in this election, but Republicans will not do too bad either.

Republicans have performed very well in the Maryland Senate campaign, where an open Democratic seat could have been an easy win for Democrat Ben Cardin. Instead, moderate Republican Michael Steele has managed to put the race into serious play. Basically, as they have proven in the past two election cycles, Republicans put on a great campaign. Democrats have a lot to make up if they are going to catch up to the Republican machine.

I'm so excited for tomorrow, I love elections, they are always so very interesting. Also, at the newspaper, we get pizza.

I will probably vote for Democrats when I fill out my ballot tomorrow. Mostly because I feel the only way we're going to change direction in this country is if we elect politicians that won't function as a rubber stamp for the Bush administration. We'll see how much good it does in Tulare County.

Well, the gay-sex preacher story just keeps getting better and better:

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — Long before the first tissue boxes were passed down the aisles for mopping tears, and before the first guitar chords were struck to begin the worship, many of the thousands of people who gathered on Sunday morning at the New Life Church here knew that it would be a service unlike any other in their lives. ...

“We’re living this in real time,” said Rob Brendle, an associate pastor, as he bustled through the 14,000-member evangelical church making last-minute preparations for the 9 a.m. service.

A male prostitute in Denver said in a radio interview on Wednesday that Mr. Haggard had been a monthly customer and a buyer of methamphetamines. Mr. Haggard issued denials, but by Saturday the brief, explosive standoff was over. The board members had heard enough — mostly from Mr. Haggard himself, they said at Sunday’s service — to justify his removal.

What was left for Sunday was to begin sorting the tangled skein of spiritual and political implications, betrayal, anguish, anger and sadness that the episode left behind in the church and across the evangelical world. Speakers urged the church’s members to find a way forward without recrimination or bitterness; a letter from Mr. Haggard was read from the 8,000-seat auditorium’s center stage.</blockquote>

Wow. I can't believe he wasn't in church on Sunday. I mean, seriously, the one day he probably should have gone.

I am so happy to say that I was wrong. Not only did Democrats ride the wave of voter discontent that the media had been foretelling for months, they have wrested the needed fifteen House seats and six Senate seats from Republican control needed to command a majority in Congress. I don't think voters could have done a better thing for America. This is exactly what our government needs: politicians who are not afraid to buck the Bush administration and its policies. It's about time we had a check on Bush.

It was an exciting night yesterday in the newsroom. Though Schwarzenegger soundly beat the snot out of Angelides, I can't feel too bad about it. He's not a horrible governor, and just as Congress checks the president, I suppose Governor Schwarzenegger should keep an eye on the Democratic State Assembly and Senate.

I hope everyone's Tuesday was as fun as mine. And if you're up for a chuckle, be sure to visit all those red blogs today. It's funny to watch an elephant walk around with its tail between its legs. And I have admit, <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2006/11/08/vent-outtakes/">Michelle Malkin's blooper reel </a>was pretty funny.

I'll be sure to chime in later!

I have produced my second video story for the Visalia Times-Delta! This video covered the story of people waiting in line for the release of PlayStation 3 for over 24 hours. It was difficult to make the story very interesting, but I tried my best, and I think it came out alright.

<a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061117/VIDEO/61117009">CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO</a>

... oh, and in case you didn't know, I'm the budding multimedia reporter for the paper, at least when the copy desk gives me some time to do it. I think it's a pretty neat thing to do, and it's what I'd like to continue to do in the future. I'm thinking of going to graduate school in the next year to pursue just such an opportunity. In case you'd like to see the <em>first</em> video story I did for the paper, you can view that <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061117/VIDEO/311170003">here</a>. I think it's much better than my second one.

On another note, the hysteria of the PlayStation 3 reminds me of when I walked confidently into numerous retailers with wads of cash looking for my coveted Nintendo 64. Sadly, I didn't get my prize until after Christmas, but I understand the feeling of asking sales clerk after sales clerk, "Do you have Nintendo 64?"

Luckily, I didn't experience anything like this:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-PlayStation-Shooting.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">Violence Mars PlayStation 3 Launch</a><br>
<strong>The Associated Press</strong>

HARTFORD — Two armed thugs tried to rob a line of people waiting for the new PlayStation 3 game system to go on sale early Friday and shot one man who refused to give up his money, authorities said.

In Sullivan, Ind., a man was in critical condition after emergency surgery for a stab wound after he and a friend tried to rob two men of consoles they waited 36 hours in line to buy, police said.

Nationwide, short supplies of the PS3 and strong demand led to long lines of buyers, some waiting for days outside stores. Once the doors opened Friday, they pushed and shoved their way to the shelves in several cities to get at the limited supply. Two people were arrested in Fresno, Calif., after a crowd trampled people in a parking lot.

It was about 3 a.m. when the two gunmen in Putnam, a town of about 9,000 residents in northeast Connecticut, confronted 15 to 20 people standing outside a Wal-Mart store and demanded money, said State Police Lt. J. Paul Vance.

''One of the patrons resisted. That patron was shot,'' Vance said.

Vance said the gunmen fled after shooting Michael Penkala, 21, of Webster, Mass., in the chest and shoulder. Penkala was in stable condition at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Mass., with injuries not believed to be life-threatening, Vance said.</blockquote>

I have to admit, it's kind of clever. Robbing a line full of pimply teenagers with their sweaty wads of cash waiting to buy a game console that is <em>not</em> worth the money. I feel real bad for the kid who got shot. I can just see the tears in his eyes as he refused to surrender his cash or his dream of owning a PlayStation 3 so he could play virtual football instead of taking a deep breath of fresh air outside and throwing a real football around.

No, seriously, it's sad he got shot, but I just think if these kids were more patient and actually thought about the circumstances — giving up the money or having the thieves pry the PlayStation 3 from your cold, dead hands — they might realize there's somethings more important than flashy game consoles.

OK, that's enough for now.

I've been meaning to start a category on music, which I don't think I'll write about very often, but whatever. Something came up today, so here it is.

A few nights ago, for some reason, Tears for Fears' '80s hit "Head Over Heels" came up in conversation. Since someone on the copy desk didn't recall ever hearing the song, I proceeded to queue it on YouTube for all to hear. After everyone cleared out, I actually sat down and watched the video to that song, which was very odd. I submit it here: Is this really a music video? Was Tears for Fears being clever or have these music video clichés truly left us as we progressed in time.

Enjoy.

And it's not like I don't have things to write. I totally have plans. Three entries have been percolating — one on The Color Purple, the second movie that made me cry; one beginning a series of entries about my training for second marathon; and another one on this album I've been listening to the past year, Nada Surf's Let Go, which is just flippin' awesome.

Anyways, for now, I'm going to chime in with a beautiful photo of Marilyn Monroe. I added Gentleman Prefer Blondes recently and I can't wait to see it. Of course, I must first sift through the latest season of my favorite lesbian show and throw back another disk of the Golden Girls. But for now I can bask in beauty of Norma Jean.

<img alt="letgo.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/letgo.jpg" width="300" height="300" class="imageright" />I would certainly qualify my attitude toward music lately to be kind of standoffish. It's been a while since I've bought an album that has just wowed me. I don't buy music that often and there are very few albums a year that make it on my must-have list. The two albums I have recently purchased, The Killer's <em>Sam's Town</em> and the Scissor Sister's <em>Ta-dah</em> were very good, but nothing has blown me away like Nada Surf's 2003 album <em>Let Go</em>.

Sadly, this is not one I have bought yet, though I am only a glance at the music store away from snatching this us. My friend Ali (who I am so happy to say I'm going to see this weekend in Sac-of-tomatoes) sent the mp3's to me via AIM. At first, it was just to supplement my Nada Surf collection, which included a few stray songs, "Popular" and "Bacardi", as well as their 2005 album <em>The Weight Is A Gift</em>, which I liked a lot.

The album came out amid very little promotion and would fit most accurately in the indie scene. I don't remember hearing any song from the album back in '03, but from what I understand, the track "Inside of Love" got moderate airplay overseas, but obviously not enough to overcome to oft-spoken phase, "Nada Surf? Those guys that did 'Popular?'" They are so much more than "Popular."

<blockquote><em>Let Go</em>
<ol>
<li>Blizzard of '77
<li>Happy Kid
<li>Inside of Love
<li>Fruit Fly
<li>Blonde on Blonde
<li>Hi-Speed Soul
<li>Killian's Red
<li>Way You Wear Your Head
<li>Neither Heaven nor Space
<li>Là Pour Ça
<li>Treading Water
<li>Paper Boats
</ol></blockquote>

<em>Let Go</em> is a classic indie-rock album. Every track on the album is inspired and absolutely unique. In the past year, I have had many experience, and it seems with every one of them I accompanied it with a track from this album. In my eternal running effort, "Inside of Love" was just one of a myriad of songs that brought me outside to train weekly for the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon last June. "Neither Heaven nor Space" and "Treading Water" are songs I picked up shortly before my hikes up Alta Peak and Mt. Whitney respectively. I can't help but listen to those songs and think about the heights I reached. Palling around with Natalie, my fabulous roommate, I have partied out to "Blizzard of '77," "Hi-Speed Soul" and even the slow-paced "Blonde on Blonde," which is featured in our favorite Queerstrokes movie <em>Summer Storm</em>.

But I think it was "Fruit Fly" that put me over the edge. Ok, this song is written exactly about what you think it is. The guy leaves a bag of fruit on the table way too long, and when he throws it away, he laments on the fate of the wayward fruit flies that remain. Of course, the flies chime in with buzzing guitars and great enthusiasm:

<blockquote><em>Geometric patterns<br>
Smearing out of control<br>
Only have enough gas left<br>
For the beer can to the bowl<br>
What can you do but go on?</em><br>
<br>
"Fruit Fly"<br>
Nada Surf</blockquote>

This album is just so freaking original and it gives me so much joy. Currently rocking out to the slow jam "Killian's Red," just because it's a great song. 

I don't know why I get such a rush from albums everyone else has long forgot. Like last night, on my way to go out after work I pop in New Order's <em>Power, Corruption & Lies</em>, their breakthrough album from 1983. I can't think of anyone else who might have the slightest interest in "Age of Consent" (but maybe the track "Blue Monday"), but still, shouldn't I be rocking out to Beck or something? My taste in music is so strange, I just thought I'd share.

Anyways, pick up <em>Let Go</em> if you haven't already. If you are into Nada Surf, you won't regret it.

Well, this clinches it. They've got my number with this one:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=53327">A devil food is turning our kids into homosexuals</a>

<img alt="soy.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/soy.jpg" width="250" height="330" class="imageright" />There's a slow poison out there that's severely damaging our children and threatening to tear apart our culture. The ironic part is, it's a "health food," one of our most popular. ...

The dangerous food I'm speaking of is soy. Soybean products are feminizing, and they're all over the place. You can hardly escape them anymore. ...

Soy is feminizing, and commonly leads to a decrease in the size of the penis, sexual confusion and homosexuality. That's why most of the medical (not socio-spiritual) blame for today's rise in homosexuality must fall upon the rise in soy formula and other soy products. (Most babies are bottle-fed during some part of their infancy, and one-fourth of them are getting soy milk!) Homosexuals often argue that their homosexuality is inborn because "I can't remember a time when I wasn't homosexual." No, homosexuality is always deviant. But now many of them can truthfully say that they can't remember a time when excess estrogen wasn't influencing them.</blockquote>

I always wondered why I insisted on the tofu and fake chicken. It seems I need the stuff to sustain the change, huh. Wow, and to think that I only need to give up soy to get into women. I don't know if I can give up a delicious baked tofu sandwich from Watson's Veggie Garden. I mean, the one I had today was positively blissful.

On the heels of my entry discussing the revelation that soy makes men gay, I am not surprised to see this coming:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.ajc.com/health/content/shared-auto/healthnews/bhvr/600136.html">Kids with high IQs grow up to be vegetarians</a><br>
<strong>HealthDay</strong>

<img alt="vegetarian.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/vegetarian.jpg" width="300" height="200" class="imageright" />As a child's IQ rises, his taste for meat in adulthood declines, a new study suggests.

British researchers have found that children's IQ predicts their likelihood of becoming vegetarians as young adults -- lowering their risk for cardiovascular disease in the process. The finding could explain the link between smarts and better health, the investigators say.

"Brighter people tend to have healthier dietary habits," concluded lead author Catharine Gale, a senior research fellow at the MRC Epidemiology Resource Centre of the University of Southampton and Southampton General Hospital.

Recent studies suggest that vegetarianism may be associated with lower cholesterol, reduced risk of obesity and heart disease. This might explain why children with high IQs tend to have a lower risk of heart disease in later life.</blockquote>

It's really funny how the story caught a lot of buzz in the newsroom. I am, shocker, the only vegetarian in the building to speak of (as far as I know). There are plenty of ex-vegetarians, and they are always asking me what's going to push me back to the dark side. I have no idea, honestly, I think when my boyfriend cooks me a big turkey for Thanksgiving or someone sends me a Chick-fil-A chicken biscuit express mail that I'll cave.

Being a vegetarian is positively fabulous. For one, it's always fun to take the moral high ground. I personally do it for nutritional reasons, but I have not shuttered at the idea of wagging my finger when it's funny or convenient. I mean, I cringed running in Yokohl Valley passing all the beef cattle. It's sad to think of all the delicious hamburgers that came from those doe-eyed fatlings.

Next Friday, for our newspaper's holiday party, I am bringing in plenty of fake chicken for everyone. It's going to be delicious, I'll be sure to convert someone or at least get some pompous brat taste the nugget and complain all party on how it tasted like tree bark or something. Oh well, those carnivores are too stupid to understand anyways.

It's not every day that, while working on tomorrow's front page, you have to scrap the whole thing to accommodate the death of a president. But tonight was such a night:

<blockquote><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27webford.html?hp&ex=1167282000&en=8487a0b616667267&ei=5094&partner=homepage">Gerald R. Ford, 38th U.S. President, Dies</a></b><br>
By James M. Naughton and Adam Clymer<br>
New York Times

<img alt="ford.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/ford.jpg" width="300" height="360" class="imageright" />Former President Gerald R. Ford, who was thrust into the presidency in 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal but who lost his own bid for election after pardoning President Richard M. Nixon, has died, according to a statement issued late last night by his wife, Betty Ford.

He was 93, making him the longest living former president, surpassing Ronald Reagan, who died in 2004, by just over a month.

The statement did not give a cause, place or time of death, but Mr. Ford, the 38th president, had been in and out of the hospital since January 2006 when he suffered pneumonia, most recently in October at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif., for medical tests. He returned to his home in Rancho Mirage after five days of hospitalization.

... Mr. Ford, who was the only person to lead the country without having been elected as president or vice president, occupied the White House for just 896 days — starting from a hastily arranged ceremony on Aug. 9, 1974, and ending after his defeat by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election. But they were pivotal days of national introspection, involving America’s first definitive failure in a war and the first resignation of a president.

After a decade of division over Vietnam and two years of trauma over the Watergate scandals, Jerry Ford, as he called himself, radiated a soothing familiarity. He might have been the nice guy down the street suddenly put in charge of the nation, and if he seemed a bit predictable, he was also safe, reliable and reassuring. He placed no intolerable intellectual or psychological burdens on a weary land, and he lived out a modest philosophy. "The harder you work, the luckier you are," he said once in summarizing his career. "I worked like hell."</blockquote>

Of course, I learned in the newsroom tonight that the former president was horrible at walking. Just like the current President Bush will go down in history for his various "Bushisms," Ford had a stride that people will never forget. Remember that time he fell down the steps of Air Force One?

<img alt="homer.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/homer.jpg" width="220" height="300" class="imageleft" />It's always sad when president dies. We actually had a discussion today over how much front page space should be devoted to former President Ford. Is he a strip lede? Is he a centerpiece? Is he a photo sell or tease to an inside story? Well, the centerpiece won out. 

I personally think that the former President Homer Simpson story clearly passes the dead president test: If he's dead, 1A centerpiece lede. William Henry Harrison, the ninth president who died in office from pneumonia after only 30 days because he insisted on delivering his inauguration address in the rain, is probably the only exception. He deserves a downpage 2-inch story that contains.

He might have not been as mounumental as Nixon. He wasn't as charismatic as Carter. He didn't stand up as a Republican to Reagan. Bush 41 could beat him at a keg stand and Bush 43 could at least walk straight. And he probably wasn't as hung as Clinton. But we'll still remember Ford, the man who fell ass-backwards into the most powerful position in the world.

Another Christmas is over and, sadly, this was the second Christmas I spent alone. I know, doesn't that sound depressing? It's really not. it's kind of understandable even. When I moved to Visalia in 2005, Christmas was less than two months away and I had three months until I could take any vacation. Spending Christmas at work was a pretty easy conclusion to come to. I didn't resent it. It sucked, but it was life. In exchange, I got to move to a fabulous new place and get the escape I had so desired.

At the same time I was grabbling with the fact that I couldn't see my family then, I was jotting down a vacation for this very week. I wanted the few odd days I had left of vacation for the year to pile up here so I could spend at least 2006 with my family. Unfortunately, a senior coworker put all his chips down and won out (but not before quitting a week before taking the vacation, effectively preventing me from spending the holiday with my family when I very well could have). Since that avenue was blocked, I looked to New Year's and on Friday I'm gone.

<img alt="joey.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/joey.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="imageright" />It's only four days off coupled with a weekend, but I think it will be enough. I'm flying home to Ohio to be with my mother for a few days. Just like my Georgia trip earlier this year, I am so excited about this trip. The one thing I almost can't stand about living here is the lack of familiarity. Everyone here seems to have some place to call home. They have some enclave to which they can return to. For me, all of that is no less than 2,000 miles over the Sierra. It's very seldom that I feel fulfilled by the familiar.

Having the opportunity to go back is like a breath of fresh air. I am looking forward to throwing Joey's tennis ball around my mother's backyard and harassing that little dog in the fresh layer of snow. I got my mother some thoughtful gifts and I look forward to seeing what she thinks of them. I can't wait to see my grandma and wish her a Merry Christmas in person and thank her again for all she did for me last year. 

Dayton represents to me this mysterious, marginal place. I was born there but I have never had a real connection there. Answering the question, "Where are you from?" has always presented a problem for me. Looking down the runway now, setting aside any other plans I would have for New Year's (and they range from a fabulous wedding to imploding of a Showgirls landmark), I realize Ohio has become something new for me. Now, I am just happy I am going home.

And in three months, I just get to do it again...

<img alt="natalie.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/natalie.jpg" width="300" height="458" class="imageright" />It's entry-palooza this week, isn't it??

I was watching Family Guy last night and I saw something that reminded me so much of my fabulous roommate Natalie. For anyone who doesn't know Natalie, she's this great person I met in California. She's been such a great friend these last few months and we've had a great time tearing it up in Visalia, Fresno and recently Sacramento.

She moved in this last October and, if you read the blog, her entrance corresponds with my sudden drop-off in writing in this silly thing. I mean, two of the entries I have done in the last 24 hours were done in her absense and I was only able to tweak out my President Ford tribute while she was sleeping on the couch.

Anyways, I'm really glad to have a friend like her and I look forward to spending even more time with her next year. We'll be swimming in men next year, I just know it! More on Natalie later if I am able to push out this year-in-review thing I've been throwing around in my head...

Hooray! I'm not dead yet! But I did need to take a lengthy vacation. My computer had a nice time getting it's brain replaced in Tennessee. I, on the other hand, wallowed on my roommate's computer playing Sextris, watching films like My Own Private Idaho and To Kill A Mockingbird and listening to albums like Nada Surf's Proximity Effect and Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. You have no idea how much blog fodder I've had to give up in the past month. I mean, Anna Nicole Smith died! When will I ever get to blog about something that huge again?

Anyways, I am really sorry I have been so scarce. I had no idea that it would be such a big deal, I actually heard from people saying they were wondering why I had stopped blogging. And it wasn't the usual suspects.

Well, I've come up with a personal goal for the year (or at least the next three months). I am aiming for four updates a week, each on different subjects, and they will go as follows:

<ul>
<li>Monday, marathon/personal blog: I had planned on writing about my progress in training for the Georgia Marathon but that just kind of sputtered right out of the gate. I'm still trying to remember to bring my camera to such exotic locales as Yokohl Valley and Rocky Hill so that I can share the sights and scene of my training experience. Just so you know, I'm progressing very well, and despite skipping this last weekend to accommodate my roommate's birthday rampage, I am certain reaching my goal of a 4:30 marathon is within my reach.</li>

<li>Wednesday, movie/music blog: There have been a few films I have seen in the past three months that are certainly worth sharing. If I haven't seen anything good recently, I may reach back for some of those picks or I may begin to feature some of my less favored movie picks. Anyone up for a screening of Gigli (like I would Netflix something like that)? Also, I'd like to blog about some albums I'm listening to, so when appropriate, you'll hear the music.</li>

<li>Thursday, politics/news blog: Depending on what's going on, I may pick an obscure story of the week to highlight or perhaps follow up on some obscure appropriations bill in the House. Someone's got to protect the Pentagon's right to relegate our liberal, San Francisco-values speaker to her connecting flight in Denver. This is when I'll do it.</li>

<li>Friday, news/California blog: On this day, I'll feature the story of the week. Odds are, it will probably be local. For this week, I'm inclined to the <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070212/NEWS01/702120323">(non) story</a> of this girl who was missing for a few hours on Sunday that had webgoers at the <a href="http://visaliatimesdelta.com">Visalia Times-Delta Web site</a> on the edge of their seats. Someone has to bring these stories to light because no matter how many Drudge tips I send, I'm dead to him.</li></ul>
And hopefully more than that. Sometimes blond women who can hardly be labeled as a model, actress or entertainer die and people like myself feel they have to comment as soon as it happens. Just to quench anyone's thirst of what I might have brought to light in such a hypothetical situation, I imagine I would have composed a sonnet exploring her various "achievements" (Don't believe me? It wouldn't be <a href="http://endlessone.com/thursday/journal/spring04/2-22-04journal.html">the first time</a>).

But I'll start all that tomorrow. For now, I have to reformat my hard drive because despite sending my computer to get a new motherboard because the AC adapter was for some reason charging the battery intermittently, I somehow wound up with a bad hard drive. Wow...and something about a bad CD/DVD-ROM too...what the hell? 

A bit of advice: Don't hand your computer to strange postmen. You'll end up regretting it.

Later

A hallowed (imitation) piece of film history has been stolen!

<blockquote><a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20070213-1212-maltesefalcon-.html">Maltese Falcon stolen from San Francisco restaurant</a><br>
<b>By Michael Kahn<br>
Reuters</b>

<img alt="falcon.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/falcon.jpg" width="300" height="381" class="imageright" />SAN FRANCISCO – Where's Sam Spade when you need him?

Thieves have stolen a copy of the bird statue at the heart of “The Maltese Falcon” from the San Francisco restaurant used as a setting for the 1941 film classic starring Humphrey Bogart as the rough-and-tumble private detective.

The small, black figure was swiped over the weekend along with 20 vintage books, including copies of the 1930 Dashiell Hammett novel on which the film is based.

John Konstin, whose restaurant John's Grill bills itself as the “Home of the Maltese Falcon,” said the thief broke into the case displaying the statue over the weekend. Konstin is offering a $25,000 reward for the replica's return. </blockquote>

I'm sorry, but if you saw the movie, they know it's a fake don't they? I mean, it was said the jewel-encrusted falcon was a decoy — a trick to throw off the men who sought the valuable real falcon. The story is even more funny because this particular (knockoff) falcon is a decoy of a decoy.

This restaurant, John's Grill, is supposed to be the hang-out of Sam Spade in the novel The Maltese Falcon. Whoever stole the bird should return it. There's gotta be some Sam Spade curse on it or something, and that's not the stuff dreams are made of...

Explanation for the insanely early post (early that is for the West Coast): I just finished a great run. I didn't run less than a 9:30 mile, which is really good for me at 4 a.m. in the morning. I jumped out of bed this morning saying to myself, "I have to have a good run today. I'm gonna tear it up." And I did. Success!

And, of course, I saw this, fitting for Valentine's Day:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/nyregion/14sex.html?hp&ex=1171515600&en=d9104c9b656a25b2&ei=5094&partner=homepage">The Greatest Generation Learns About Great Safe Sex</a><br>
<b>Corey Kilgannon<br>
New York Times</b>

<img alt="goldengirls.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/goldengirls.jpg" width="300" height="441" class="imageright" />The sex educators had come to a Queens housing complex to discuss condoms and foreplay and sexually transmitted diseases.

Those assembled were told that their demographic was showing increases in sexual activity and an accompanying rise in promiscuity, homosexuality and H.I.V. infection.

As the teacher, Monique Binford, delved into an unexpurgated discussion covering issues from vaginal dryness to Viagra, one student’s cane clattered to the floor, another student adjusted his hearing aid and a third fidgeted in her orthopedic shoes. By the time Ms. Binford got around to describing a safe sexual act involving Saran Wrap, a woman shouted, “Enough, already!” and the room erupted in laughter.

The sex educators had news for this class of 40 people in their 70s and 80s, just in time for Valentine’s Day: Older folks are friskier than ever, and it’s never too late to learn about safe sex.

Sexually speaking, said Norm Sherman, who organized the presentation, “It ain’t over till it’s over.”</blockquote>

This story made me smile. There's nothing I like better than hearing older people get some. There's just something so sweet about that. Just because you're 60 and single doesn't mean you shouldn't get laid.

For the past year, I've been making my way through over 200 episodes of The Golden Girls. In my Netflixing rule book, I pick one series from which I rent one season after the other until I've proceeded through the whole series. The series I watched before The Golden Girls was Sex and the City, and it seemed only appropriate I follow a great show with its obvious antecedent.

I'm winding down season five now and I'm about to tear through six and seven (the final season). It's been a great show, if repetitive as sitcoms usually are. I really felt almost bored in the first three seasons. I thought I'd die if I heard another St. Olaf story from Rose, but by season four and five, you can really tell that the actresses had grown into their characters and were able to bring them to a really fresh and funny place.

I like Dorothy the best, but you have to give it up for Blanche. I watched an episode with commentary this past weekend (the one where Sophia and Dorothy dress up as Sonny and Cher) and actress Rue McClanahan reflected on her character's overwhelming gay following: "I asked a gay young man, 'Why do you like Blanche so much.' And he said, 'Don't you see, it's because we want to be Blanche.' "

Oh, to have as many men as Blanche. I only wish I got that much play when I'm 35...he he he

Well, after my first week back, I think I did alright. I'd like to log 4 entries a week, and this week I did three (I don't count the return entry). I'll try to stick to the schedule, but when you are up at 5 in the morning and are likely the first to see an article about senior citizens getting it on and you want to blog about it, there's no better time than now as opposed to saving it for the Thursday news/politics spot.

But one thing I neglected this week was my film/music blog. So here goes...something I should have done a long time ago...

<img alt="colorpurple.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/colorpurple.jpg" width="300" height="460" class="imageright" />My favorite thing about Netflix is getting the opportunity to see movies that I know I should see. Something told me that The Color Purple was a movie I had to see. Honestly, I had no idea what it was about. For some reason I thought it had either Janet Jackson or Oprah in it (It did indeed have Oprah in the movie, Janet Jackson was in Poetic Justice, which at some point I confused with Dead Poet's Society). After rising slowly to the top of my queue and eventually reaching my mailbox (to the chagrin of my roommate who's more interested in picks like Entourage), it was showtime.

The Color Purple is about two black sisters, Celie and Nettie, who grow up in the South under difficult circumstances. Celie looks after her sister as best she can, and when an older man comes calling for Nettie's hand in marriage, the girl's father (who rapes her often and fathers a child with her) palms off Celie instead. Celie begins her difficult life with Albert and his kids where she is regularly beaten and terrorized. She's expected to clean, cook and even shave her husband. It is a miserable life, and Celie is completely subservient to her husband.

Her one joy comes from her relationship with her sister, who eventually comes to stay with Albert and Celie. Albert, still feeling the urge to bed Nettie, follows her to school one day and attempts to rape her. Nettie refuses and she is driven from his home. Though she promises to write, Albert forbids Celie to even touch the mail and for several years effectively imprisons her in her empty, loveless life.

Celie is portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg, and I have to admit, I have never seen such fine acting as this from Whoopi before. The whole movie you watch the tragic life of Celie and you just wish she could find the strength and confidence other characters, like Sofia, portrayed by Oprah Winfrey, find in their relationships with men. Celie initially finds this defiance toward men as wrong, and tells Sofia's husband, her stepson Harpo, to beat Sofia. Eventually, though, Celie sees in Sofia the woman she needs to be.

I don't want to say too much about the movie because it is truly a great film. It was released in 1985, so a few people might not be inclined to give it a chance. It's really worth it. I may have mentioned that A Very Long Engagement is the only film that has made me cry. That's not true anymore, the ending of The Color Purple brought tears to my eyes, it was absolutely beautiful.

Please check it out. I wish I could say more, it's just been a few months since I've seen it so the scenes aren't fresh in my mind.

And check back this Wednesday (hopefully). I just watched a great horror movie and I'm aching to write something about it. You might have heard of it...Jesus Camp.

<img alt="marathontable219.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathontable219.jpg" width="300" height="315" class="imageright" />It's a shame that I've been training for the Georgia marathon for the past 3 months and I haven't written very much about it. I had intended on updating my progress every week as a way to blog about something very interesting to me as well as to coach myself through the training. Sadly, that never materialized, but with just a scant 122 miles left in my trek, better late than never.

Training for a marathon is a very amazing feat. Pulling together all those numbers to come up with 247 miles run since late November is staggering. I had to add up the runs again to be absolutely certain I didn't make a mistake. They really do add up.

When I started training this time around, the marathon itself was cemented firmly in the center of mind. I knew running 4 or 5 miles each training day had a point because it was going to make that first stretch of the marathon that much easier. After a while, though, the marathon drifts in your mind and you begin to take each week for what it is, almost forgetting all these miles amount to something. I'm at the point in my training when that once-sought goal is beginning to rise again.

This Saturday's 16 mile run was not very successful. Granted, I did the run, but I kept thinking during the run that my heart just wasn't in it. I've been working long hours at work with little return. I'm having to accommodate weekly runs by waking up at 3:45 in the morning in order to get them out of the way before I have to go into work. All of this weighs heavy after a while and when you finally get to the one day a week you get off (I was supposed to have the weekend off, but that changed), you realize all you want to do is sleep. I walked a bit of the run because I was just exhausted. I'll make it up next week.

Anyways, back to the larger point: the goal. This past Saturday was the first in a line of the most intense training days I will have before the marathon. The next two runs will be 18 and 20 miles respectively, and they are very important. At mile 8 this past weekend, I sat sipping my Gatorade thinking, "I'm only 2 miles away from 20 miles," meaning only 2 miles from the 10 mile mark, the halfway point for my longest run of the training. I can't wait to get there.

After that point, the marathon itself will begin to crystallize for me. My trip to Atlanta will be a double-edged sword: I get to see my friends and family, but I also have to tackle a 26.2 mile behemoth. I know that by the end of that 20 mile run, I'm going to be ready to comprehend exactly what I need to do to make that goal.

To do better this week, I am going to try to wake up early instead of taking the run later in the afternoon. I think I will have more energy then. Here's hoping! We'll see how it goes...

Next week I'll try and bring my camera to share some sights from Yokohl Valley and maybe even Rocky Hill.

<img alt="jesuscamp.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/jesuscamp.jpg" width="300" height="444" class="imageright" />As the credits rolled after the documentary film Jesus Camp and the raised eyebrow on my face began to dip south, I started to realized the fundamental flaw in characterizing the film as a documentary. This film is a certified horror movie. Scariest thing I've seen all year.

The documentary, by directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, chronicles only a very thin slice of evangelical Christians in the United States. Most of the film focuses on the children's ministry of one Becky Fischer, who actively evangelizes to children and encourages them to spread the gospel amongst their family, friends and community.

The scene of the film is rather horrific, the number one worst day of the Bush presidency: Sandra Day O'Conner's announcement that she is stepping down from the Supreme Court. The stage is set for what evangelical Christians consider paramount to their agenda of re-establishing a Christian government in the United States. The cameras then descend on one of Fischer's children's conferences where kids are indoctrinated with the Christian faith.

What's really horrific about this film is the extent that these poor children have been completely mind-warped by this twisted woman. The film revolves around a boy and a girl, Levi and Rachel, who actively press strangers about the Christian fate, even asking one man, "If you died right now, where do you think you'll go?" At parts in the film, the kids are even encouraged to speak in tongues as adults press their hands on them to encourage the "holy spirit."

I don't know where to start with this movie. It's an excellent documentary and I think the filmmakers were very fair to Fischer and her cause. Even though she has been forced to shut down the "Kids on Fire" summer camp due to negative reaction to the film, she herself has stopped short to condemn the film. She feels the film helps communicate her message of faith and our children to the world. I couldn't agree with her more, I'm getting her message loud and clear.

She begins the film watching some of the filmmakers raw footage and remarks, "Liberals must be shaking in their boots when they see this!" I wouldn't label myself a "liberal," though I was shaking, but not because of my fear of the rising tide of evangelical youth prepared to spread the word or God to the masses. I felt very sorry for these children, who no longer play with action figures and dolls, play in baseball leagues and softball, they are forced to handle more difficult concepts like abortion and culture war in their parent's and pastor's despicable plot to impose their political will on this nation.

I am thankful that I never had to experience the kind of spiritual agony these kids must endure. I can't tell you how many times I could imagine every word through these children's mouths came from someplace else. They are mindless androids, and denying them the right to learn and make their own decisions is, as one commentator in the film suggests, a mortal sin.

If you're dying to see this film, please pick it up. But don't turn the light off...

Yeah Nick this movie was disturbingly good. 

It was really crazy how Becky's thoughts on the camp were...if the Muslim world can train their children to kill at an early age then Americans should take that example to train our children to be the soldiers of the lord.

twisted.

did it bug you (or was it just me) that that Levi had a really ugly mullet?

The saga that was Anna Nicole Simpson's life doesn't seem to have been snuffed like a candle in the wind. Despite rising to that glorious centerfold spread in the sky, various lovers, family members and diabetic lawyers have positioned themselves in an all out brawl over who's going to get her body.

It's pathetic:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/02/22/smith.ruling/index.html">Emotional judge rules on Smith's body</a><br>
<b>CNN</b>

<img alt="annamom.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/annamom.jpg" width="300" height="339" class="imageright" />MIAMI, Florida — Custody of the body of former centerfold Anna Nicole Smith was awarded today to the guardian for her 5-month-old daughter, Dannielynn, by Broward Circuit Judge Larry Seidlin.

Seidlin directed the guardian — Richard Milstein — to consult with Howard K. Stern, Smith's partner and lawyer at the time of her death; Larry Birkhead, Smith's former boyfriend; and Virgie Arthur, Smith's mother, about burial plans.

Smith died February 8 in a Florida hotel, but the cause is still unknown.

Shortly after the ruling, it appeared all the parties had agreed to a burial in the Bahamas.

Thursday's ruling capped several days of unusual courtroom proceedings that touched on child custody and paternity, though the issue at hand was limited to the disposition of Smith's body. Some called the proceedings a circus.

Before ruling, Seidlin told the parties in the case, "I feel for you, I absolutely feel for you."

"I've reviewed absolutely everything. I've suffered with this," Seidlin said.

He addressed Smith's mother several times as "mama" and told her and the others he was trying to reach an equitable decision.</blockquote>

I think it's pretty sad that these grown adults can't come to a consensus on the wishes of the departed. I think it's pretty clear she cared very deeply for her son, Daniel Smith, and wanted to be buried in the Bahamas with him. I don't know why this idiot judge let her estranged mother spend more than 2 seconds in that courtroom. It's perfectly clear she's only after a slice of the silicone...err, money.

I truly hope the judgment means Smith's body will be buried next to her son. I'm sure that's what she would have wanted.

But on a lighter note, we really do have more to look forward to from Anna Nicole Smith. Even in death, she never ceases to amaze.

Meanwhile I have a huge itch to go watch the Anna Nicole Smith Show. Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna! Anna Nicole!

<center><img alt="yokohl1.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/yokohl1.jpg" width="558" height="419" /></center>

I was gushing about my weekend plans this Friday in the newsroom. I really only had one major thing on the agenda: run 18 miles at Yokohl Valley. This guy who I work with, a real cynical guy, asked me, "Why?" I told him I was training for a marathon. He asked again, "Why?" And I told him it made me feel good. And he asked again, "Why?" I think I blubbered something about accomplishing something incredible, and blah blah. He just brushed me off and told me, "You're crazy."

<img alt="marathontable226.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathontable226.jpg" width="300" height="315" class="imageright" />I don't know if he's right about that. I must be crazy to trump a zillion more pleasant things to do with my weekend by insisting I spend nearly 4 hours slaving in the sun trying to beat the clock. I don't know, it seemed to make sense at the time.

Unlike the week before, I've been doing really well this past week. When I laid out that 122 miles on that little .jpg graph last week, it made me feel more inclined to complete my miles for the week. Of course, whenever I complete my plan for the week, I always feel good. Since it's been up and down the past few weeks, I guess I really wanted to feel like I was pulling it together for the big day. That day, of course, is this Saturday.

Last year, when I was training for the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon in San Diego, I never ran the 18-mile training day. I did 16 miles in Athens when I was visiting in Georgia, but that was hardly comparable to what I accomplished this weekend. I remember walking a great deal and I don't think I even completed 16 miles. I was just above 15 when I finished. This past weekend, I kept myself above my goal 10:17 pace with the exception of one mile, which included the most grueling hill of the entire circuit. I let it slide.

<img alt="yokohl2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/yokohl2.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="imageleft" />My only problem at this point is the water breaks. The only way anyone can really finish a marathon for the first time without extensive experience is by breaking it down into small pieces. The way I see it, I'm just running two miles until the next water break. When I get there and am refreshed, I take on another two and possible take a gel to help increase my energy. This has been a real problem on days like Saturday. After hills like the one I just mentioned, I tend to sit on a stump sipping my Gatorade and taking a break. During the marathon, that's not an option.

I will probably break a few times for my 20-mile training day — I have to. It's so long, it's probably impossible for me to take it all in one gulp. I think once I finish this grueling day and throttle back to shorter runs. I may try to scale back my break times. During the marathon, there being no stumps to sit on, I will probably have to get by with an occasional stroll through a water stop or a light jog.

Anyways, I did take pictures as I promised. I may share some more next week. I can't believe how good I looked before taking on the day! It's amazing how much eighteen miles takes out of you.

But, I can honestly say, it was worth it.

It's funny, when the thought occurred to me to move to California (which happened shortly after the state of Georgia passed a blatant, inexcusable measure designed to denigrate gays and lesbians as second-class citizens forever), I figured I would be free from all of that in the bluest of the blue states. On the whole, that is very true. California is a great state and I live confident that even with a Republican governor I am respected and honored as a citizen. But even the blue states tend to have a red streak.

Visalia is a pretty conservative, family place. It's a gorgeous, wonderful place to live, but there are also many Bible-thumping freakazoids that like to throw the good book around into people's faces. Letters often appear in our paper that lash out at the "homosexual deviants," and I place them, because I think it's very healthy for people to speak their minds (even though I don't necessarily agree with them). And, thankfully, there are people who respond to such nonsense. One such response in its entirety:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070302/OPINION03/703020352/1014/NEWS17">Homophobia is rampant in this community</a><br>
<b>Jim Mancini, Visalia</b>

Why does the Times-Delta seem compelled to print so many letters from Visalia's Christian, homophobic community?

I've lost count of the number of letters from Christian dogmatists who usually quote a passage in the bible that "clearly" condemns homosexuality. The latest, from Sam Lukes, quotes one of their favorite passages, (Romans 1:26:27). He says, "God is quite clear."

Even as a high school student who studied the Bible (Roman Catholics' version) for two years every day in religion class, I realized that it is a collection of writings by people of ancient times who were new and zealous converts. Furthermore, someone had to edit these writings and choose which ones to include. So today we have many versions that claim to be the true interpretation.

With all due respect to those who interpret the Bible literally, there are many of us who do not. The social context and language usage at the time that the stories in the Bible were collected, edited and published were much different than today. These writers were from different cultures quite limited in their scientific knowledge. Add to this the various language translations and the Bible is far from "quite clear."

Many modern biblical scholars interpret that passage in Romans quite differently than Mr. Lukes. He might try to open his mind just a little and research other points of view. All the Bible thumpers out there who like to quote verses that justify their homosexual bigotry should also mention that the Bible condones genocide, mass murder and slavery.</blockquote>

God bless you.

Anyways, we have this wonderful "StoryChat" feature on our Web site that makes it very easy for those indoctrinated nutjob drones to instantly respond to a reasoned argument. You can only imagine what things were said, but I thought this response deserved the spotlight (but there are several worth mentioning):

<blockquote>If you don't like the religious justification against homosexuality, how about this.

A lesson in basic plumbing explains it for me. The human body has "in" holes and "out" holes. When it comes to traditional love making, men do not have an "in" hole. Women do! Two men together or two women together have to break the laws of basic plumbing to attempt to make love. Using "out" holes as "in" holes is not a good idea. Seems simple to me.

How about from natures perspective. Natures goal for animals(including humans) is to promote survival and create offspring. man + man = no offspring... woman + woman = no offspring. Again... seems pretty simple!

— ForTheKIDS</blockquote>

You know, he's got a point. I mean, nothing ever comes out of a vagina, ever! Only in. A special trap door must open when it's time for babies or "that time of the month." 

And it's a good thing God-fearing Christians NEVER use that other "hole" they must be speaking of (the anus), because they have so many other holes to choose from. And I guess if the vagina has that coveted "in-hole status," the mouth must also be dubbed an "in hole" since things more frequently go in than out. And of course, no one has been impeached or sent to fiery damnation for sticking their dick in that, now have they.

Freaking psychos...

It feels strange to be on the other side of March 3rd. It really wasn't anything more than my 20-mile run, but last year that meant so much to me.

When I took on the 20-mile run in preparation for the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon in San Diego, I had never really run more than a few feet over 15 miles. I had taken a serious stab at the 16-mile run when I was visiting in Georgia last May, but it was very half-hearted. It was more a tour-de-force of my former stomping grounds. I ran all the way from downtown Athens to my old apartment and beyond. I walked often and when I returned to my friend Padmini's house, I scoffed at my recently-acquired GPS personal trainer that said I had only run 15 miles (of course now I can testify to the accuracy of that nifty device).

This year, I have made it to the top of the hill at mile 8 on more than one occasion. I have begun to frequent the water stops that I no longer need to set my odometer when I'm driving ahead to place my water stops. Twenty miles, to me, represents no more than two miles more than last week, and that's somewhat disappointing.

I almost think that the 18-mile run was more difficult. It was such a nonstarter. Still having the same problems: too much rest. I'm going to run the remaining training days without stopping for water. I can easily run an 8-mile run without water (I think I'm overly hydrated as it is). The last Saturday run — only 10 miles — I can bring the water-bottle pouch I bought for the last marathon if I need it. I know during the race I won't have the opportunity to sit on a stump and take a breather, so at least any sluggish time won't be as wasteful as standing still for 5 minutes. It's going to be cool...

<img alt="marathontable305.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathontable305.jpg" width="300" height="315" class="imageright" />One thing I did do last week was skip my mid-week runs. I lost a total of 11 miles on my training schedule, but it was totally worth it. At this point in the training last year, I was having shin splints and I was in bad shape. This time around, my legs are aching all the time. Now that I'm through the thick of the training, I just need to keep them warmed up and ready for the big day. There was no point subjecting them to unnecessary strain in advance of the big 20-mile Saturday. I knew I was going to make it, with or without the extra training.

The photo I included this week is the "T." When I was training with Team in Training, I always imagined it stood for that since we parked a few hundred feet from that sign. Now, when I see it rising over the hill, I know the run is almost over. Now that I'm slowing down in anticipation for the actual race, it's sad to think that the training is really coming to an end.

I'm so pissed that I didn't hear about this sooner:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/09/arts/television/09inman.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">John Inman, Television Actor, Dies at 71</a><br>
<b>Agence France-Presse</b>

LONDON, March 8 — John Inman, the British actor who became famous for his role as an eccentric shop assistant in the BBC comedy “Are You Being Served?”, died here Thursday. He was 71.

His death was announced by his manager, Phil Dale. He had been suffering from hepatitis A.

He starred as Mr. Humphries in the popular comedy, which was broadcast from 1972 to 1985. At its height it attracted an audience of 22 million viewers in Britain and was then sold around the world.

His camp catchphrase “I’m free!” helped him win an award for Funniest Man on Television presented by the British weekly TV Times in 1976. In recent years, Inman regularly appeared in pantomime productions.

He is survived by his partner, Ron Lynch.</blockquote>

If you haven't seen the britcom "Are You Being Served?" then you are really missing something. Mr. Humphries was my favorite character (well, I was partial to Mrs. Slocombe). He was so flamboyant and gay, but he always knew how to play it cool. It was never 100% obvious he was gay, he was a fabulous actor. He's my britcom hero.

I'm sad, don't know what else to say. It's best to let Inman lead us out:

It's great that The Associated Press has started to slug the fun stories with the word ODD in all caps. It makes finding gems like this so easy:

<blockquote>3 injured by cats that invade house in Nebraska<br>
<b>The Associated Press</b>

<img alt="lilyohio.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/lilyohio.jpg" width="300" height="210" class="imageright" />NORTH PLATTE, Neb. — Two stray cats got into a house and attacked three people inside, then were euthanized and checked for rabies, authorities said.

The cats entered Melissa Breva's house through an open front door on Monday, and attacked two women visitors and a boy, authorities said.

"I thought I had seen it all, but I have never seen anything like this," Chief of Police Martin Gutschenritter said.

Animal control officer John Pettit responded to a call for help, Gutschenritter said.

One woman was scratched and bitten on her legs; the other woman was bitten on her right calf, authorities said.
After talking to them, Pettit went to his truck for snares, then heard screaming from inside the house.

"When he ran back, he saw a young male with blood over his face," Gutschenritter said. "He was bitten on his forehead, nose, left ear and right cheek."

After some first aid from Pettit, the three were taken to Great Plains Regional Medical Center.

When investigator John Stadler arrived and opened the bedroom door, "he saw a gray and white cat baring its teeth in attack mode," Gutschenritter said. "He shut the bedroom door and returned to his car for a dart gun."

Both cats were shot, tranquilized and taken to the animal shelter, where they were euthanized.

The bodies were sent to Lincoln for rabies checks, Gutschenritter said.

Authorities want to find out who owned the cats. Under a city ordinance, cats may run free if they don't become nuisances.</blockquote>

I don't know about you, but I think if a cat came at me in "attack mode," I think it would be time to whip out the Kung fu, John Inman style. Waaaa!

More on my pending marathon soon. My leg has been bothering me this week, trying to take it easy. In a week I'll be in Atlanta!

<img alt="marathontable325.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathontable325.jpg" width="300" height="315" class="imageright" />Well, the marathon has arrived. I know I haven't chimed in with an update really since I started my whole post-20-mile slow down. There really hasn't been much to report besides this nagging pain in my leg that I'm praying isn't as bad as I fear it could be. I took things really easy on myself for the past two weeks. I feel very lazy though, I am kind of itching for a good run. It would have been nice to get a few more training runs in, but I want to be 100% on Sunday.

I'm on the plane writing this now, actually, and there is a woman sitting on my row who has taken on the same goal that I have been considering: running a marathon in all 50 states. It's an incredible goal, and when I mentioned it in my typical blabbering manner to the man who sold me the shoes I'm going to wear in the race on Sunday, he laughed out loud. "Who would want to do that??"

I need to keep the long runs up though. I must admit I really enjoy my Saturday runs. Though I'd much rather get sleep, There is something so calming about lacing up at 6 a.m. and trotting down Yokohl Drive alone. It's breathtaking and I always come home feeling incredible. Regardless of what happens Sunday, how can I not do this again? Why wouldn't I want to committ my adult athletic life to something spectacular that only a very select few could ever hope to accomplish. It's these goals that keep me going, these personal feats that provide me with great personal pride.

But that's the day after the day after tomorrow, isn't it? Shouldn't I be more concerned over the fact that my friends have noticed a slight limp in my step the past two weeks? Shouldn't I be wary of all those extended breaks I took at every water stop in Yokohl Valley? Is there anything more I can do?

The race Sunday will be great. I'm expecting, in light of my sometimes sluggish sum pace on my training days, I will finish between 4:40 and 5:00. That's commendable, but I want to do better. I still somewhat consider that a lazy marathon (but an improvement on my first).

I think I might surprise myself tomorrow. While I did take the water stops slowly while training for Rock 'n' Roll Marathon last year, I also walked a whole lot more than I did this year. I ran at a brisk pace for the majority of all my runs this time around. I also showed up to an impressive amount of mid-week training runs. I followed the schedule very closely, so I may find that even walking through the water stations on Sunday will still bring me to a 4:45 finish (maybe even 4:30). I'm just trying to be realistic and not get my hopes up.

In concert with running my second marathon and marking a second state off my marathon list (only 48 states left!), I will be visiting Georgia, where many of my dear friends still live. I'm looking forward to this very much and I'm thrilled I will have the opportunity to share this race with the people I care about. I'm especially proud of my friend Marilia, who will be running her first marathon on Sunday. I can't wait to see her sprint across the finish line. I just hope her experience will be as positive as mine has been.

This is a dream come true for me, I've looked forward to this weekend since last summer when I was bemusing crazy thoughts with Marilia on a Sunday evening. It's amazing how far I've gone. I've run over 300 miles since November 20th. I've been so committed to this, I'm so stoked to see it finally come full circle. Please wish me well and thank you so much for your support!

I'm sorry, I thought of this headline, and since it's getting no facetime in the newspaper, I have to put it here.

<blockquote><a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070402/NEWS01/704020307">From caskets to Easter baskets</a><br>
<strong>Staff reports</strong>

<img alt="caskets.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/caskets.jpg" width="300" height="197" class="imageright" />Dozens of children gathered in front of Miller's Funeral Home in Tulare on Saturday to celebrate Easter a week early.

The event featured face-painting, a bounce house, a coloring contest, games, food and an Easter egg hunt for two age groups.

hapel supervisor Mary Mendonca said this is the first Easter event the funeral home has held.
Usually, the funeral home holds a Christmas event.

"We just wanted to see how it works," Mendonca said. "A lot of people say 'Why have an Easter event at a funeral home?' We are just giving back to the community and the families that we have served here in Tulare. That's all it is."</blockquote>

I also came up with "Funeral home brings new life to Easter," but my editor shot me down. Lame!

Expect photo-induced marathon post soon! I've been lazy, blech!

<img alt="vegas1.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/vegas1.jpg" width="300" height="348" class="imageright" />It was amazing. I felt like Nomi Malone walking into Ver-sayce for the very first time: My first trip to Vegas since my "Showgirls" awakening. This weekend I went to see my good friends Padmini and Braniff, who moved to Las Vegas last year after graduating UGA.

It's quite extraordinary. I only have Jeremy to blame. Ever since that DVD took a spin, I have been devoted to the crazy film that is a considered a camp classic as opposed to the abysmal film most people remember. There are many memorable scenes, but none as outrageous as the Spago scene. Shortly after I disembarked from McCarran, Padmini and I ventured to the hallowed film landmark that is the Forum at Caesar's Palace. There I was on cloud 9.

The highlight of the trip would be asking the waiter at the ritzy Spago retaurant for chips, even though they were not on the menu. When they were brought to the table, I couldn't help but relive that awesome scene...

<blockquote><strong>Crystal:</strong> Do you like brown rice and vegetables?<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> Yeah.<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> You do?<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> Sort of...<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> Really?<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> Worse than dog food. It is!<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> I've had dog food.<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> You have?<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> Long time ago. Doggie Chow.  I used to love Doggie Chow.<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> I used to love Doggie Chow too!<br>
<em>[As if the wall that had once separated them had been felled by wave of Doggie Chow, Crystal raises the chip in her hand and Nomi touches her chip to it and they toast chips.]</em></blockquote>

<img alt="vegas2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/vegas2.jpg" width="300" height="318" class="imageleft" />It was like everything I dreamed it would be. Afterward we went to the Ver-sayce and I couldn't help but notice that the photo I took resembled a doorway to heaven, likely the same image that came to Nomi's mind when she first laid her eyes on the establishment. If only the sight of expensive dresses could bring me to the heights it brought her, but I will be just fine living vicariously through the acting of Elizabeth Berkely.

Well, now that I've gotten over the Showgirls-related goodness (we took a photo outside of the Cheetah too!), I can talk about how wonderful my trip was as a whole. Padmini was so wonderful and I had such a great time going around with her and Braniff. Never have I seen such a complete picture of Las Vegas. Oh so often, tourists are relegated to the two or three miles they decided to walk along the Strip. There's so much more to Vegas than that. There's the renowned Thai restaurant we went to on Friday evening. There's the delicious vegetarian Chinese restaurant Braniff and Padmini took me to before we went to "Mamma Mia." And then there's Red Rock Canyon, a beautiful natural landscape that not even California can claim.

We also enjoyed many things on the Strip. I got to see the aquarium conservatory at Mandalay Bay. There was the fountain at the Bellagio that played "All The Jazz" from "Chicago." And the premium outlet where I spent too much money. It was truly the vacation that I never expected. I would have been perfectly happy with chilling at the apartment with Turtle (the cat) watching a movie with friends.

So that was my vacation to Vegas. It was wonderful and I can't wait to go back again (I hear there's a marathon in December). And I really can't wait for Padmini and Braniff to come visit me. There's nothing like sharing the Sierra with friends.

And I swear, marathon entry this week!

P.S.: Video bonus, Padmini's sister's commercial for Swami Pretti Dance Studios. Fabulous! All it's missing is a star wipe, but the bubble wipe almost just as good!

There's no reason why I shouldn't have written this a month ago but I have just been on a break. 26.2 miles takes a lot out of you, and so does working 50 plus hours a week. Things are finally slowing down now and a lot of interesting changes are coming down the pipe. Before I go into all that, it's important that I at least address my major accomplishment, at least once before it fades into obscurity.

It was Sunday, March 25, and I woke up at my sister's friend Tyler's apartment feeling just a tiny bit uneasy about the race. I had spent the three weeks prior taking it real easy. After finishing a grueling training schedule, I had hoped to keep up the pace in the weeks closing in on the big day, but pain in my leg had forced me to rein in my ambitious plans. I woke up that morning thinking that maybe I had eroded a lot of the ground I had worked so hard to gain footing upon. Part of that was true.

Regardless, I could only race with the body I had and not the body I wish I could have had. My leg was thankfully not bothersome on race day and I made my way down to the MARTA station in Midtown Atlanta at the fine hour of 5:30 in the morning. The race was an hour and a half away.

I arrived at 6 a.m. and called Marilia. She had it real rough, a lot worse than me. I'd done this before. A marathon for me would be 26.2 miles of deja vu. Sure, it was going to be rough, but at least I knew I had once stood (barely) at the finish line. For Marilia, finding the finish was not a done deal. Also, catching the train on time was also missing from the cards — she arrived 10 minutes before the race. I tossed her her things, gave her a Tylenol 8-Hour, a kiss and I told her I loved her and good luck. It was her race and I couldn't run it for her. Besides, I had a race to run myself.

<img alt="marathon2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathon2.jpg" width="256" height="384" class="imageright" />It wasn't until the mass of people started to finally eek its way to the start line that it finally hit me: I was really running this. I got a chill down my spine and I felt something I didn't expect I'd feel in the warm familiarity of the brisk Atlanta morning: I was in this all by myself. Sure, Marilia was probably a half-mile behind me there, but just like the first race, I ran this one alone. The track was familiar. My sister was a text message away, but I was still in this for myself. I somehow thought that running on the streets of Atlanta would be like seeing every neighbor and friend cheering me on, that somehow an envelope of everything I remember from my years in Georgia would whisk me joyfully to the finish line in a rush of joy and triumph. It wasn't like that at all. I had to run every single one of those miles and all the city really afforded me the comfort of was a few moments along the lines of, "Oh, Decatur...I've been there."

Well, I didn't have a cheering section, granted, but I didn't have one in Yokohl Valley either and I had some of my best runs out there. I could do this. The early race went very well. I kept up a very great pace and walked through many water stations for maybe 45 seconds or less. The only major train wreck came from the race itself — no Powerade! It was promised but the race barely delivered. At best we'd get a heavily watered down sprinkling of Powerade powder and at worse we got no water at all! Between mile 3 and mile 8, there was no water at all! And the worst part of it all was the signs promising water that didn't actually deliver until 3 miles later! It was awful, but it was a real boon for me. I never walked substantially until the half. I was in prime form.

Sadly, the hills of Decatur hit my pride hard and I began to conserve my energies. Conserving began to weaken my resolve and I started to scale back my goal from 4:30 to 4:45 and 4:50 (4:59?). I walked a lot toward the end and I only have myself to blame. Besides that, water stations were never reliable and Powerade was absolutely no where to be found in the second half of the race. I had relied very much on Gatorade in my training so I'm almost certain that had an effect on my energy. How much, I'm not certain, but I still tried to stick it through.

<img alt="marathon3.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathon3.jpg" width="255" height="384" align="insetright" />In the end, I finished the race in 5 hours and 4 minutes — a full 15 minutes faster than I did in San Diego almost one year ago. It was a fabulous end to a marathon effort. I am very pleased with my finish and I only hope to roll back my time 15 or 30 minutes more in my next race. My goal is to surmount a marathon again before the end of the year. I have my eyes on the Sacramento race in December but I may also try for a summer race along with a quicker training schedule.

Also, I am considering rearranging any future marathon training schedule. Distance is no longer taboo for me. Fourteen miles is a drop in the bucket, and 18 to 20 is also very doable, even now after slumming it for almost a month. I would like to start running longer distances and working on speed in my future training. I know I can make 4:30, I just need to chip away at it more and more.

For now, I'm taking a serious break. My leg pain really worried me and I think I've been overdoing it so long. I think I may have slipped into a postrun depression too, which is kind of unsettling. An almost, "What's the point?" feeling has settled over me. I run so much, it's like there is no end. The race was the end, in this sense, so what next? I'm still thinking, but I know I will be running again soon. Maybe I need a special treat, like a new iPod to bring me into play again. I just know I'm not through. I will be running a 5K on May 5th at the very least. I may try for an exotic half-marathon somewhere in California. I just need to rearrange a few things and soon I'll be laced up and on the run again.

If you have ever experienced something similar, please offer up some pointers. I'd love to get myself out of this post-run depression and get back on the road.

So that's that. More on some of the other stuff later. Right now I'm going to enjoy the rest of my evening and listen to some tunes. Later.

<img alt="golden.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/golden.jpg" width="400" height="604" class="imageright" />It might be described as a mistake, maybe, but for the past year (and more) I have been going about the arduous task of watching the entire "Golden Girls" series on DVD. One might ask, "Why?" and I might need to remind one that I don't have cable so its difficult to take a walk down memory lane by clicking through the dial to Lifetime. After finishing "Sex and the City" so long ago, I decided to jump to the antecedent and get a glimpse of television history. Oh boy, did I get that in more.

Watching a sitcom on DVD, at least at first, can be very difficult. A half hour is not very much time, but a nine half hours of repetitive television writing, especially in those early seasons, can really suck the fun out of the better part of three hours (though episodes of "The Golden Girls" are very enjoyable to throw back on a lunch break). It's been quite a trip, but I finally made it through all 180 episodes.

If I could give my opinion on the series, I would say that it is most certainly excellent. There are so many episodes that are worth watching. Some that are just hilarious. Some that are very obviously ahead of their time. Some that are surprisingly current and touching. My all time favorite I think would be the one where Dorothy and Sophia dress as Sonny and Cher and sing "I've Got You Babe." Fabulous. I wish I could find a clip.

The series really hit its stride in seasons 3 and 4. You could really see it try a resurgence in season 6. I really thought that Dorothy and Stan were going to get back together. Having Leslie Nielsen come swoop up Bea Arthur without a fight was pretty weak. It would have been nice to see Stan and Dorothy get back together, but I guess some things are not meant to be. By season 7, the series was truly done, and I'm glad it bowed when it did. Hopefully I'll have an opportunity to see "The Golden Palace" because its always great to see an old friend.

For now, for better or worse, Dorothy, Blanche, Rose and Sophia are still with us. Bea Arthur has completed a one-woman show on Broadway. Rue McClanahan has finally written the book she was meant to pen, "My First Five Husbands ... And the Ones Who Got Away" (It's available this month, go get it! She's led an amazing life). Betty White has lived a long and lovely life and now works tirelessly for animals, her lifelong passion. And sadly, our champion Estelle Getty lives out of the public eye, suffering from a debilitating disease, but still committed to raising money for AIDS research and living each day to the fullest.

It was a pleasure exploring the work of these fine women. So, I find myself at an interesting juncture: What next? From "Sex and the City" to "The Golden Girls," I may take a brief stop with the serials "Dead Like Me" and "Entourage" before moving on to "Six Feet Under." I want a reason not to go there, but I haven't found one. So, hopefully the next one won't take me all year to finish.

For fun, a clip of Estelle Getty, Betty White and Rue McClanahan:

When a classified ad appeared in the Fresno Bee last month looking for the owner of a lost goldfish, David Letterman couldn't help but bite. But the Fresno Bee bit off a little more than it could chew:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.fresnobee.com/263/story/46745.html">'Reunion' turns out to be just one big fish tale</a><br>
<b>By Cyndee Fontana</b><br>
Fresno Bee

<img alt="goldfish.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/goldfish.jpg" width="300" height="251" class="imageright" />Did you hear the one about the fat, blind goldfish rescued off a lawn and reunited with his owner?

Turns out it was more than just a fish story. It was a hoax.

Wednesday -- when The Bee published an article about Charley the goldfish's reunion with his owner -- some readers called to blow holes in the story.

Charley is real. So are Lori Igasan and Bernadette Planting, the two women featured in the article. But they're not strangers to each other, as they told reporter Will Albritton, and good old Charley never was lost or discovered on Igasan's lawn.

"Journalists are trained to be skeptical, but at some point we have to take people at their word," said Betsy Lumbye, executive editor and senior vice president of The Bee. "We're disappointed that these ladies weren't honest, and disappointed that we didn't catch the hoax."

Both women said they meant no harm with their yarn, which started with a classified ad in The Bee and achieved minor notoriety on "Late Show with David Letterman."

To Igasan and Planting, friends for several years, it was simply a joke.

"It was not our intention to hurt anybody," said Igasan, who launched the hoax with an ad that read: "Found: Large, obese goldfish. Approx 11yrs old, blind as a bat."

Igasan said the ad was part joke, part genuine effort to unload a fish she no longer wanted. She said she received about 150 telephone calls.</blockquote>

I know it's kind of hard when the sources are working against you, but you've got to admit the story sounded a little fishy from the get go. This particular story got my attention mostly because they did a video story on it and that's interesting to me because I'm our newspaper's new multimedia reporter. The story was so-so, and now it's a complete fraud.

I think more should have been done but whatever. It was fun while it lasted.

I'm kind of in one of those funks at the moment but I feel it may soon translate into some more entries. Hooray! Next week should be better!

<img alt="neworder.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/neworder.jpg" width="300" height="283" class="imageright" />They may have passed quietly, but I heard it. And thankfully the sound is still ringing in my ear.

New Order, one of the most enigmatic and inventive bands of the last 30 years, have finally called it quits. The band formed from the band Joy Division after the suicide of Ian Curtis. They have produced hits such as "Blue Monday," "True Faith," "Crystal," "Age of Consent" and "Bizarre Love Triangle," by far my favorite. Bassist Peter Hook announced the band's split on his MySpace blog on Wednesday:

<blockquote><a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=180575671&blogID=262679181&MyToken=c77a2624-ef19-44e9-8db5-ce4cc439be11">life goes on!</a><br>
<a href="http://myspace.com/180575671">http://myspace.com/180575671</a>

well here we go again another action packed week.

i suppose it was the interview with clint boon that started it all off hed asked me for a few words on perry farrells satellite party single dogstar [which he thought was great] so i went on and lo and behold mentioned the N>O> split so i suppose because it was me sayin it it was out at last. im relieved really hated carryin on as normal with an awful secret so lets move on shall we?</blockquote>

It was as recently as Friday night that I was driving with Natalie rocking out to "Age of Consent" on the lonely drive back from Fresno. I've even turned her on to the band, burning her a copy of <em>Power, Corruption & Lies</em>, the bands seminal 1983 album that beget "Blue Monday," which still influences artists in the realm of Trance and House music.

New Order is part of my own personal trifecta of musical groups that I'm always citing: garbage, New Order and The Cure. Garbage announced Friday that their long-expected greatest hits album <em>Absolute Garbage</em> would be hitting stores soon and The Cure have been riding rumors of a new album since the whole of 2006. I had heard New Order was keen on releasing a new album from their <em>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</em> recording session, but now that is a big question.

This isn't the first time New Order has ducked from the music scene. Between the release of <em>Republic</em> and the recording of <em>Get Ready</em> in 1993 and 1998 respectively, New Order seemed a lost relic of the '80s. Hopefully they can demonstrate the resilience and fortitude to reunite and forge another album to close out the decade, or at least bring us into the next. They are talented and timeless musicians and I am very sorry I may never have the opportunity to see them play again.

For now, I'll leave you with the video for "Krafty," from the <em>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</em> album, which helped to rescue me from a endless, consuming depression.

<img alt="whywefight.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whywefight.jpg" width="300" height="396" class="imageright" />One of those "green vegetable" films I've had on my Netflix queues for a while is the 2005 documentary <em>Why We Fight</em>. The film explores the now long-established American industry that makes war and purports to defend this nation from threats both foreign and domestic — an entity dubbed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Commander during World War II and two-term president, as the military-industrial complex.

The concept of a military-industrial complex is something not easily grasped by someone from my generation. The apparatus itself is not wholly visualized in a government building or agency. It is not limited to one group of people or particular creed to statue. The first time I ever heard the term was in my high school history class where my teacher went to the extraordinary precaution of closing the door and swearing us all to secrecy while he divulged his theory as to who was really responsible for the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The movie never directly addressed these controversial judgments of history, but it did hit on one event that I will likely fully conceptualize throughout my entire adult life: The Iraq War.

Ever since I was a young boy, I have heard of the evils of Saddam Hussein and how imperative it was to U.S. interest to eliminate him from the world. I have never been personally slighted or directly influenced by the evils of this man, but I have nonetheless heard the steady drumbeat of war coming from the mouths of politicians, whether on Capitol Hill or on the Sunday morning talk shows, since the early nineties and to the final days leading to March 19, 2003, when George W. Bush ordered U.S. military forces to end the Iraq regime and uncover the fabled "weapons of mass destruction."

I remember that day very well. I was in my hotel room on my spring break vacation in New Orleans. I was with my friends Missy, Sonya and Ilya and we had just recently arrived in New Orleans and were preparing to go out for the evening. I paid particular attention to the television screen that evening as the opening shots of the war were fired. I remember hearing Sonya ask why I would watch something so uninteresting and I couldn't help but point out the seriousness of history that was occurring at that very moment. That moment was as serious then and it was a turning point for all Americans, whether they tacitly approved of our involvement and turned their televisions off that evening and slept soundly or if they very earnestly tried to convince their politicians to change course and sat awake fearful of the results of our actions.

The film seizes on this shared experience we all have and attempts to connect the invisible, faceless machine that is the military-industrial complex the Eisenhower choose to warn Americans about in his waning days in power. The film attempts to explain why America fights in conflicts around the world and tries to uncover the shifty, mysterious agendas of public figures, corporations and shadowy think tanks that collectively built the machine that paved our way into the conflict.

As an concerned American and journalist, I look at the Iraq War, like many, with increasing impatience and anger. Is this the conflict our president said was ours to fight in the wake of 9/11? Did we truly enter this war with no exit strategy or were these policymakers neglecting to tell us the whole truth on the subject — that we would never leave.

The role of the military-industrial complex might not be the whole bogeyman the film paints it as. There are some conclusions drawn in the war, especially regarding American motivations at the end of the Second World War and at the beginning of the Atomic Age, that my roommate and I openly objected to while watching the film. But the film's detailed exploration of the military-industrial complex, from the larger conflict today to its affects on ordinary people with ordinary lives as military contractors, soldiers and weapons engineers, is very accurate and eye opening, especially to someone who might be completely unaware of the beast that lives in breaths in and out of our government today.

No one should watch this movie without an open mind and willingness to engage the facts in open discourse. As Eisenhower said in his closing address, "Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together." While many in the annals of history have failed their countrymen in this endeavor, anyone hoping to conceptualize today what Eisenhower warned of so long ago cannot do so blindly and without a firm grasp of the facts at hand.

Please watch this film.

It turns out Jerry Falwell, founder of the "moral majority," has died at the age of 73.

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/obituaries/16falwell.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">Jerry Falwell, Moral Majority Founder, Dies at 73</a><br>
By Peter Applebome<br>
<b>New York Times</b>

<img alt="falwell.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/falwell.jpg" width="298" height="340" class="imageright" />The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the fundamentalist preacher who founded the Moral Majority and brought the language and passions of religious conservatives into the hurly-burly of American politics, died yesterday in Lynchburg, Va. He was 73.

His death was announced by Liberty University, in Lynchburg, where Mr. Falwell, its founder, was chancellor. The university said the cause had not been determined, adding that he died in a hospital after being found unconscious in his university office yesterday morning.

Mr. Falwell went from a Baptist preacher in Lynchburg to a powerful force in electoral politics, at home in both the millennial world of fundamentalist Christianity and the earthly blood sport of the political arena.

As much as anyone, he helped create the religious right as a political force, defined the issues that would energize it for decades and cemented its ties to the Republican Party.</blockquote>

Am I sad that Jerry Falwell is dead and gone? Hell no. He was a hateful, narrow-minded man who empowered a generation of hateful, ignorant, like-minded bigots to rise up against innocent people they disdain and refuse to accept. Would you honor the life of a racist man if you were black and witnessed first-hand the effects of polarizing hate perpetuated by that one man?

I find it insulting to read <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2007/05/15/breaking-jerry-falwell-in-gravely-serious-condition-after-being-found-unconscious/">certain red blogs</a> that are playing "gotcha!" with other left-leaning sites for taking a shots at the holy man. If my prayers would be for anyone, it would be for the man's family and loved ones. They are the ones who deserve mercy, but not that hateful man, one who spoke these shocking words after one of our country's most tragic events:

<blockquote>I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.' ~ Jerry Falwell, September 11, 2001</blockquote>

In the coming years, that man will be remembered more for his hateful, polarizing rhetoric against gays and lesbians than for his upholding of the faithful tenets of Jesus Christ. Anyone who hesitates in this fact will grow to regret it in the coming years and decades. This man is a dinosaur and the world is better now that he has passed.

An interesting thing came up in the debate between Republican candidates for President Tuesday night: blowback.

I found something very interesting in the film I watched the other day on that very subject. I wish I could express myself more clearly tonight, but this is something that I think is very important and it's something that I have always suspected since the very first few days after 9/11. Chalmers Johnson, a CIA expert, had some very interesting things to say about "blowback" in the documentary <em>Why We Fight</em> (which have been conveniently posted on <a href="http://www.collectedthoughts.com/blog.aspx?id=11462">this blog</a> for you to see for yourself):

<blockquote><img alt="chalmers.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/chalmers.jpg" width="200" height="302" class="imageright" />There is a direct connection between events that happened more than 50 years ago and the War in Iraq today. In 1953, the prime minister of Iran, Mohammed Mossadeq became extremely irritated the British were ripping off his country's national resources, he wanted a greater share in it. The British came to the new president, Eisenhower, and asked for help on this. Eisenhower very conveniently declared Mossadeq to be communist and we then set the CIA to overthrow him. 

The result was we brought the shah to power and he created an extremely repressive regime that within 20 years had led to a revolution against him. The Ayatollah Khomeini creates a government that is violently anti-American.

In the after-action report by the CIA on what they had done in Iran in 1953, they said "we're going to get some 'blowback' from this."

We then made a puppet out of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, who was a friend of ours. He was an asset in the CIA's computers. We did so because he was anti-Iranian. He was very fearful that the revolution in Iran would spread into his county. He therefore went to war with Iran. The war was extremely bloody, went on throughout the 1980's. Unfortunatly for Saddamm Hussein, he began to lose the war.

At that point, in comes the United States in the form of Donald Rumsfled sent to Saddam Hussein by President Reagan to tell him, "We will provide you with intelligence, we will supply you with the weapons you may need thorough covert means." It is why cynics in Washington say "We know Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We have the receipts."

This is what we mean by blowback. He remained a friend of ours right up to his invasion in the summer of 1990 of Kuwait. We became alarmed when he invaded Kuwait that he could also go on and invade Saudi Arabia itself, the largest reserves of oil on Earth. We stationed troops in Saudi Arabia. It was a mistake in every sense of the term.

Remember, Osama bin Laden had said, "I resent the government of Saudi Arabia for using Americans to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq." At that point we began to fear we were going to lose our position in Saudi Arabia. Well the second largest source of proven reserves on earth are in Iraq. This leads us now to demonize our previous ally and to prepare the American public for the thought that we must take him out.</blockquote>

Presidential candidate and Texas Representative Ron Paul brought up the issue of "blowback"  in the debate last night and has since been blasted by conservatives for daring to suggest 9/11 was in any way our fault. I believe he handled himself very well in harsh light day on Hannity and Colmes last night (hat tip to <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/05/16/ron-paul-schools-hannity-on-blowback/">Crooks and Liars</a>).

I never understood why it was so outrageous to think that the terrorists who attacked us on that horrible day had some defensible vendetta against the United States. I for one do not believe we should lump "terrorists" into convenient categories such as "evil-doers." I certainly don't think they have a legitimate excuse to attack Americans, I'm just saying their reasons, given their unique, individual experiences with U.S. foreign policy seem to explain why a certain group of people in this world hate us.

They don't hate us because women can vote. They don't despise us because we have the right to speak freely. They have simply experienced the day-to-day hell that has been inflicted, either directly or indirectly, by our government's actions in the world. Look at what happens in Iraq day in and day out and tell me you can't understand why someone would take arms against our country (or dare to attack us on our own soil). Again, not to say I defend their reasons...I simply acknowledge that they have a position.

I think what Ron Paul said last night at the debate is what Americans need to hear in this national contest: honest, frank conversation that seeks to uncover the root of the problems that our forces are facing today. Maybe if we considered things like "blowback" when we decide to unilaterally impose our will on another country, things like 9/11 would not happen. <em>Again, wrongs made by elements of the military-industrial complex and not everyday Americans who somehow invited tragedy on that fateful day</em>.

I find this incredibly entralling and it would be even more interesting to see more of this in our national debate.

Law enforcement sources tell TMZ that while Paris' medical condition has stabilized, she is emotionally still extremely fragile and is holding on by a (100 count) thread. We're told she prays constantly in her cell, asking for strength.

According to sources, Paris says support from her family is the only thing that is sustaining her. That and the prison gruel.

<img alt="thebridge.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/thebridge.jpg" width="300" height="444" class="imageright" />This is a documentary I have been waiting quite some time to see. There is something so horrific and alluring about this film, a documentary on one of the world's most-chosen suicide spots. Jumping from the crosswalk on the Golden Gate Bridge almost always results in death. Falling helpless into such a grim certainty was enough for 24 individuals during 2004, and this film captured 23 of those individuals' deaths.

I have been so fascinated by death since I graduated from college and started a life on my own. Growing up, there are so many things before you, death is rarely acknowledged or considered. It was only when I had embarked on that my career's empty road that I really began to consider the inevitability that I will one day pass. It's scary to think about. It's even scarier to imagine what it would be like for someone to face that inevitability in less than 5 seconds — the time it takes for your body to fall from the bridge and hit the bay.

The film was very good, but it was not "horrific" as I had expected. You get a lot of what you expect to see. The footage is amazing and what you'd expect. Nothing is very close-up, so its impossible to capture much of the person's emotion in their final moments. In the end, the film is horrific in its premise: How can a filmmaker set up a camera for one year with the intention of capturing suicides on film and not actively intercede on behalf of very these troubled individuals? According to the filmmaker, efforts were made when a person was observed making moves as if they were about to jump, but that creepy feeling is not fully shaken through the whole of the film.

What I found most disturbing about the film were the interviews with family members and friends of individuals who had jumped from the bridge. In many cases, they had anticipated the attempt and even tacitly encouraged it. They had given up any hope on re-affirming this person's hold on this world and instead wanted to let them go in peace. I suppose this elicits some understanding, but not much from me. One woman had not only given her friend the drugs that further pushed him to his wit's end, she brushed him off on what turned out to be his moment of need, hours before he gave it all up for glimpse beyond.

All in all, I'd say it is worth seeing. It doesn't demystify death for me in any way, however. The film is effective in tying together the varying lives of individuals who are desperate and troubled enough to consider ending their lives. It helps to shed a light on a world some walk in that is devoid of hope and meaning. This is thankfully a world I have never walked in, but hopefully, if anyone I know falls down this path, I might recognize it and intercede on their behalf.

According to filmmakers, one person attempted to throw themselves from the bridge once every 15 days.

<img alt="bushreid.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/bushreid.jpg" width="247" height="402" class="imageright" />For over a year now, our Congress has subjected this country to a grueling and often times heated debate on the status of legal immigration and the question of what to do in response to the millions of people who have streamed into this country over the years. After passing two versions of immigration-reform measures — one vehemently opposed by Latinos, which favored enforcement and implementation of felony status to undocumented immigrants, and another which imposed a series of fines and other steps that led to eventual citizenship — the extreme right wing of the Republican Party set out to stifle debate and gum up the conference committee process to a stand still, preventing the bill from coming up for consideration before the 2006 Congressional elections. Extreme right-wing Congressmen, who knew they would have to compromise with the more moderate Senate, even held useless public hearings in border cities across the country in a pointless attempt the further "research" the issue.

The country wisely through the Republican leadership out of power in November and once sensible leadership had returned, Democrats gave the conference committee process the proper attention it required and produced the compromise bill the country deserved. Certainly it had its issues. It wasn't a right-wing bill or a left-wing bill, but a measure which made concessions on all sides. It funded the border fence Congress approved last year and it provided an alternative to undocumented immigrants living in the shadows to come into the country legally by either paying the government fines or re-entering the country as part of a guest-worker program, which has been championed by President Bush.

Frankly, I don't really care that much about the bill. The debate is of no personally significance to me, though I do feel the answer to the country's immigration problem does not lie in aborting 12 million from this country. That's not possible. I do believe that this country deserves for this bill to receive a fair hearing in the Congress. The House and Senate should have every member on record because our country deserves a resolution to this debate. What happened today is an injustice to all Americans:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/washington/29immig.html?hp">Immigrant Bill Dies in Senate; Defeat for Bush</a><br>
By Robert Pear and Carl Hulse<br>
<b>New York Times</b>

WASHINGTON, June 28 — President Bush’s effort to overhaul the nation’s immigration policy, a cornerstone of his domestic agenda, collapsed Thursday in the Senate, with little prospect that it can be revived before Mr. Bush leaves office in 19 months.

The bill called for the biggest changes to immigration law in more than 20 years, offering legal status to millions of illegal immigrants while trying to secure borders. But the Senate, forming blocs that defied party affiliation, could never unite on the main provisions.

Rejecting the president’s last-minute pleas, it voted, 53 to 46, to turn back a motion to end debate and move toward final passage. Supporters fell 14 votes short of the 60 needed to close the debate.

Mr. Bush placed telephone calls to lawmakers throughout the morning. But members of his party abandoned him in droves, with just 12 of the 49 Senate Republicans sticking by him on the important procedural vote that determined the fate of the bill. </blockquote>

<img alt="michelligation.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/michelligation.jpg" width="300" height="450" class="imageleft" />I have been reading with great interest many of the right-wing blogs that have gone to war over this bill. I find myself amazed at the effort expended all in the pursuit to snuff out a bill that may not serve the aims of the extreme right wing but instead serves the will of the center. Conservatives pride themselves on the myth that the majority of Americans are conservative and are likened to their agenda. While past elections (with the exception of the last one) have lended themselves to that opinion, I don't see why that should in any way give politicians the impression that the country will be best served caving into the extreme right wing on an issue like this.

This bill is a largely conservative bill. I think the whole reason it died a slow and painful death in the Senate is that the only vocal base willing to come to bat to axe this thing to death was right talk radio and the red blogs. Every other constituency felt largely indifferent to the bill because it was aimed to the center.

Thanks to conservative gas bags like Michelle Malkin, Laura Ingraham, Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter, and other right-wing nutjobs, the immigration bill was not defeated on its merits, it was bottled up by a mere cloture vote. How pathetic. This coming from the same idiots who cried bloody murder for any filibuster by Democrats when they were in the minority. It's ridiculous.

So where do we go from here? Liberals bask in Bush's defeat? Conservatives start shaking their empty tin cups for funding for their super fence? Meanwhile, ordinary Americans are left shafted by a political system that seems only to serve the fringe interests. Absolute garbage.

<img alt="allensworth.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/allensworth.jpg" width="300" height="362" class="imageright" />I have been working on a story for the past month on Allensworth, a city established in 1908 entirely by African Americans. The county has approved the establishment of two dairies within two miles of the city, which has been abandoned and re-created as a state park. If you know anything about dairies, you should know this: They stick. If a dairy sets up less than a mile from the park, whatever visitors do come to the park may have a very unpleasant time. Many African Americans feel that the county's rubber stamp on the new dairies is just another attempt to wipe away a hallmark of Black History and they have lobbied quite successfully politicians in Sacramento that are passing a bill to establish a buffer zone around the park.

I've been to the park four times in the past month. The last time I went was on June 23, for their Juneteenth celebration. I had to abandon any plans I had to attend Gay Pride in San Francisco for it. Somehow, it didn't really matter to me. The excitement and life of the park was thrilling. As a journalist, it felt wonderful to be a part of something under normal circumstances I would observe as an outsider. Everyone was very gracious and kind to me and I was happy to see the park with so much life again.

Today I finished the second, larger video on the park. It seeks to explain, in the words of African Americans, why the park deserves to be protected by the state. I think it's very good and I thought I should share.

Well, leave it to me to wow everyone, but I produced just about the best story and video this week ever! Well, maybe that's giving me too much credit, but I've gotten a lot of positive feedback from my work.

So, anyways, my editor clued me in a couple of weeks ago in on a story at Mineral King, this valley in Sequoia National Park. Basically, one of the other reporters went up there and saw that people had wrapped chicken wire around their cars to protect the engines from these animals called marmots, which are basically large alpine squirrels. I had to get more info, so on Tuesday I drove up to the park with the camera and this is what I saw:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070712/NEWS01/707120320">Mineral King marmots cause problems for cars</a><br>
By Nick McClellan<br>
<b>Visalia Times-Delta</b>

<img alt="marmot.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marmot.jpg" width="309" height="282" class="imageright" />If you choose to hike or camp in Mineral King this summer, the animal most likely to cause damage — and leave you shaking your fist — is not a bear.

Large alpine squirrels known as marmots love to munch on engine wires and hoses. They also drink copious amounts of ethylene glycol, a chemical found in many kinds of automotive antifreeze.

... Mitchell Hauptman, a park ranger stationed at the Mineral King ranger station, said three vehicles have been towed this season because marmot damage rendered them inoperative. Other visitors got off easier, including one who left the following note at the ranger station: "Doesn't look serious, but it took a while to scare him out of the engine compartment."

... No one knows for sure why marmots find car parts and fluids so appealing, said Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Wildlife Ecologist Harold Werner.

The fluids also don't seem to harm the marmots as they would housepets.

"They seem to become ethylene glycol junkies," Werner said.

... Visitors who fail to protect their vehicles from marmots may find themselves taking one or more home in the engine cavity, Hauptman said.

"I've heard stories of marmots making their way down to L.A.," he said. "But they're fine. People give us calls, 'We have one of your marmots.' "

His usual response?

"It's their marmot now," Hauptman said. "Marmots don't FedEx well."</blockquote>

My editor told me she liked the video and the story like three times today. I always get so excited when I do something right. Future stories for me include: following some guy who turns cooking oil into biofuel, filming a wild mixed martial arts match and snapping pictures of some tots competing in a sort of miniature Olympics.

But, before you see any of that, you have to see the marmot video! It's awesome. And I'm telling you, if you haven't crossed paths with a marmot, you haven't met the most interesting and mischievous creature this side of the Sierra.

This seems to be the year that disgraced (and <a href="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/2007/05/jerry_falwell_onetime_nemesis.html">should-be disgraced</a>) evangelicals are being called home:

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Obit-TammyFayeMessner.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">Tammy Faye Messner, 65, former evangelist, dies</a><br>
<b>The Associated Press</b>

<img alt="tammy.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/tammy.jpg" width="300" height="412" class="imageright" />RALEIGH, N.C. — Tammy Faye Messner, who as Tammy Faye Bakker helped her husband, Jim, build a multimillion-dollar evangelism empire and then saw it collapse in disgrace, has died. She was 65.

Messner, who had battled colon cancer since 1996 that more recently spread to her lungs, died at her home Friday, said her booking agent, Joe Spotts. A family service was held Saturday in a private cemetery, where her ashes were interred, he said.

She had frequently spoken about her medical problems, saying she hoped to be an inspiration to others. "Don't let fear rule your life," she said. "Live one day at a time, and never be afraid." But she told well-wishers in a note on her Web site in May that the doctors had stopped trying to treat the cancer.

In an interview with CNN's Larry King two months later, an emaciated Messner — still using her trademark makeup — said, "I believe when I leave this earth, because I love the Lord, I'm going straight to heaven." Asked if she had any regrets, Messner said: "I don't think about it, Larry, because it's a waste of good brain space." </blockquote>

Of course, if you haven't seen "Through The Eyes of Tammy Faye", maybe her passing means little to you. But don't think she's just another hateful evangelist. Tammy Faye was a very loving individual and I hope she suffers no longer.

Perhaps there's a "Surreal After-Life" with which she can form prayer circles with and regale her cast mates with her endearing stories. She will be missed.

Apologies for not writing. I've been busy, that goes without saying. First up: Half Dome.

<center><img alt="halfdome.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/halfdome.jpg" width="558" height="418" /></center>

Natalie and I went hiking up Half Dome last weekend. It was part of my super weekend in Yosemite. It all began on Friday evening after Braniff and Padmini came to visit for the weekend for National Parks adventures. We went up to Yosemite and found a nice campsite and roasted up some soy dogs and soysauge and rode the weekend along as it drifted away, like the pristine constellations that wafted in and out of the endless sky. I haven't been anyplace like Yosemite Valley in the two years I've lived here, it was amazing. It was a microcosm of everything that the Sierra has to offer.

<img alt="nicknathike.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/nicknathike.jpg" width="350" height="282" class="imageleft" />On Sunday, Natalie came up for our big finale. I might not have mentioned, but Natalie was awarded a fellowship with the Metcalf Institute, so she is moving to Rhode Island this week to begin her studies and her eventual placement at the Providence Journal. It's a real bummer, she's been my best friend for a year now here, and I'm really going to miss her. Since we have been talking about tackling Half Dome since October of last year, we had to take the trip while we could.

This hike was unlike anything I have experienced so far. For one, instead of tackling a 16-mile hike in a day (much like my 22-mile hike up Mt. Whitney, which took 16 hours), we decided to split it up over two days, camping at Little Yosemite Valley, which is about half way to the summit. Because of this, I had to rent a large pack so I could carry the food, sleeping bag and tent for us. It was very rough to say the least.

On the way to Little Yosemite, we took the Mist Trail, which brings you up close to Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls, some spectacular sights. Unfortunately, though the trail is relatively short, the elevation gain is brutal, so I tired very easily carrying my large pack around. I was dying to get to Little Yosemite, where, once I arrived, I quickly assembled the tent and laid back on my new sleeping bag for a snooze.

That evening, Natalie and I shared our food with fellow campers and scored some tasty potatoes and a shot or two of tequila. In the morning, though we started out two hours after we had intended, I was slow to keep up with Natalie, who was on a rampage like always. We started at 7:30 and reached the cables by 9.

<img alt="thecables.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/thecables.jpg" width="300" height="881" class="imageright" />The cables are something else. Sure, they are the most dangerous part of the Half Dome hike, but Natalie and I agreed the section from "the step" to just before the cables was pretty scary. Bascially, after climbing all these steps and making it to at least the point that you can begin to see the end, you have to scale these semi-steep granite slabs without any indication of direction. Natalie and I mistakenly opted for a course on the right, which was very grainy, where one slip would have us sliding down the mountain. Luckily, we were alright.

You absolutely need gloves on the cables. If I didn't have them, I would be toast. As long as you have a firm grip on the cables and are able to pull yourself steadily up the very steep granite dome, you can do just fine. My biggest annoyance was Natalie's stop-and-go pace up the dome. I would be right behind her and she'd swat me away from her wooden plank. But if I waited, she'd be five or six planks above me and I'd have to scale the cables by myself without anyone nearby to help.

The view was spectacular. The best thing about the trip was on Saturday, when I was with Padmini and Braniff, I looked out into Yosemite Valley from the Tunnel View. By Monday, I was looking out toward the same tunnel from the very top of the Valley. You can't beat it.

The hike down was dramatic, to say the least. Natalie and I pulled it together, though. It was a great weekend, but by the end of it I was getting sick of all that fresh air and dirt under my fingernails. But I still can't complain too much — though it can be a real drag, living in the Central Valley, so close to the Sierra, certainly has its perks.

So Natalie moved out on Sunday. If you aren't clear on who she is, I mentioned her <a href="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/2006/12/drunk_chick_at_a_party.html">here</a>. She's basically the reason that I stopped writing in my blog so often. She's my best friend in California and it hasn't quite sunk in how much I'm going to miss her. Thankfully, I replaced here (roommate wise), so I don't have to focus on the negative aspects of her move (that being the negative effect it's going to have on my financially). I'm really happy for her, but already I'm felling that vivacious and adventurous spirit she inspired within me deaden.

But that won't last. Even though people in my life drift in and out, I like to think that I take of piece of them with me. Though I won't get to see Natalie every day and rampage across the state with her (Los Angeles, Sequoia National Park, Fresno, Santa Cruz, Sacramento and Half Dome to name a few), I can already feel that little piece of Natalie within me finding its place. I have my reusable shopping bag ready to go and florescent light bulbs are all over my shopping list. Oh, and I cleaned the kitchen today...but that habit won't last. I guess I'll always be me.

My computer is on the fritz again so I will be back, new and improved...well, all over again. So woopie! If you've been wondering what I've been up to, go to the <a href="http://www.VisaliaTimesDelta.com/Video">Times-Delta video page</a> and you're sure to see I've been busy.

<img alt="iphonevsipod.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/iphonevsipod.jpg" width="350" height="295" class="imageright" />A few weeks ago, Apple Inc. released the long-awaited iPod updates, doling out new colors for iPod shuffle, video capabilities for iPod nano and jumbo size upgrades for the iPod (which has been redubbed the iPod classic). This is all well and good, but the biggest development of this week's Apple delivery was the unveiling of a product I have been longing to buy ever since iPod video underwhelmed with poor video performance: the iPod touch.

The iPod touch is the video iPod the world has been waiting for (one that doesn't necessitate the need for a 2-year contract). I personally made a vow, after reading rumors reports widespread across the Internet at the time, that I would put off purchasing my first iPod until I could claim the true video widescreen iPod. Well, the wait is finally over, and after pacing on it for a few days, I bought it and it's on its way to me right now.

I understand the limitations of the iPod touch. For one, it has some of its iPhone-like cababilities intentionally amputated. What is the harm in allowing an editable calendar application and personalized e-mail application? Who knows. Perhaps the rawest deal would be the device's storage limitations. I am basically downgrading from a 20-gigabyte iPod (which I got for free by selling a piece of my soul, long story) to a 16-gigabyte iPod. I think I can make it work since I mostly only ever listen to my highest-rated music. I am also fulfilling my previous iPod's role as a music-backup system by placing recently-added music since the last DVD back-up. So I think the size limitations will be a non-issue. Perhaps one day, when a 60 to 80-gigabyte iPod touch emerges, the days of carrying my entire music library on my arm while running in Yokohl Valley will return.

In the prenuptial days before my iPod arrives, I've been doing some research on it and I've found some helpful reviews and videos that may be useful for the few Podheads out there considering their own iPod choices. Best of luck!

This is one marathon experiences I will never have...

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/sports/othersports/30marathon.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">Marathon record is set in Berlin</a><br>
By Liz Robbins<br>
<b>New York Times</b>

<img alt="marathonrecord.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathonrecord.jpg" width="250" height="338" class="imageright"  />BERLIN, Sept. 30 — Cruising alone for the final seven miles on the Berlin city streets lined with damp, golden leaves Sunday morning, Haile Gebrselassie shattered the world record in the marathon by 29 seconds, securing a mark he has coveted since he was a teenager in Ethiopia.

The rain and wind had stopped by 9 a.m. after a soggy three days, and, along with a flat course and five pacesetters flanking him, the conditions were ideal for Gebrselassie’s record run of 2 hours 4 minutes 26 seconds for the 26.2 miles.

It was 29 seconds faster than Paul Tergat’s previous world record on this same course in 2003. To the 34-year-old Gebrselassie, this world record, his 23rd in distances ranging from two miles to 5,000 meters to the marathon, this record was the most satisfying.

"Without question,” he said, grinning, “because it is the king of distance."</blockquote>

I need to run another marathon...

To follow up my Google-favorite entry, titled <a href="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/2006/07/kikyos_dead.html">"Kikyo's dead!"</a>, I have to announce the passing of another hallmark Inuyasha character: Kohaku.

If anyone has been keeping up with the goings on of the Inuyasha manga, you have got to be stoked. So many plot points are becoming neatly tied into little knots all up and down feudal Japan. To name a few, Inuyasha has finally bested Sesshomaru as far as the disputed Tessaiga and Sesshomaru himself has resurrected his long-missing left arm and in its grip was his own daiyokai sword, Bakusaiga. Kagome has delved into her spiritual self to reveal why she has always been such a pussy — the reason being because the dark force in the Shikon jewel named Magatsuhi has sealed her spiritual powers. And the loving duo of Sango and Miroku have risked their lives to sustain their only weapons against Naraku, Sango strengthening her Hiraikotsu and Miroku dangerously pushing his body to its utmost limit, with a line of shoki inching closer and closer to his heart.

Needless to say, our heroes have been very busy. And in the most recent installment, Chapter 528, Kohaku, damned brother to Sango who was revived by a shard of the Shikon jewel, overcomes his many sins and grabs hold of his false life, vowing to defeat Naraku and purify the jewel once and for all. After freeing Kagome, who had characteristically been captured by Naraku, Kohaku stands triumphant, vowing from now on, he would live his live like it were his own.

It is in that moment that a discarded piece of Naraku's flesh, like a magic bullet, shoots into Kohaku's back and out his neck, CAPTURING THE SHIKON JEWEL SHARD AND KILLING HIM! This is humongous news for Inuyasha fans! With Kohaku's death and a lily piece of Naraku flesh darting up to momma Naraku with a jewel shard surprise, that can only mean the manga's end is nigh!

I get a lot of comments asking where to go to see Inuyasha scanlations. Well, click <a href="http://freelance.110mb.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://adinuyasha.thebrokenconsole.com/">here</a>. They are great!

More to come, I promise!

These special days, as I mount many ambitious plans for my future, I am noticing it's harder and harder to hold on to my hard-earned cash. One of the reaons this is so is directly related to the little nuissance that wandered into my apartment a few months ago: Sue.

Yes I have a cat now. He is a little bastard but I love him. Natalie and I were having a few drinks, toasting her recent ascension in the newspaper world, when she heard what she described as two cats fighting. I went downstairs to investigate and out of the bushes romped out the source to all my financial woe. He was an emaciated little feline and Natalie was happy to share some kibble (our first mistake). Ever since, he has not left my apartment (except of course for that wonderful day we had his little balls chopped off).

I have to say, after a few months, I am really taking a liking to this cat. He really does love me a bunch (he's curled up next to me as I write this entry). As much as I wished he would have just moved on those first few days, it's kind of nice to have a pet at last. I always knew that if I was going to get a cat, the cat would have to find me.

As for why we named it Sue, only Natalie and I know the true story. But as you can guess, it has a little something to do with a little diddy by Johnny Cash. Let me know what you think of my boy named Sue!

BEACON – A Beacon man fended off a rabid fox with a loaf of sliced bread Wednesday, after the animal ran out from under his pick-up truck and attacked his leg.

Gary Kemp had just arrived back at his home in the Oak Meadow mobile home park, when he was greeted by the terminally ill intruder.

“The fox was hiding underneath the Bronco, and he came out and charged out at me, and started making this weeping noise as he was charging,” Kemp said.

The gray fox attacked his legs, and Kemp beat the fox with a loaf of bread until it ran away.

Kemp's home security system captured the attack on video tape.

While Kemp was showering, a neighbor was attacked and beat it with a black top rake and then had to run it over repeatedly with a Lincoln Continental until it died.

The fox was tested positive for rabies by the Dutchess County Department of Health.</blockquote>

In the words of my friend Jerm, "Rabies is scary." Damn right.

<center><img alt="christmas.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/christmas.jpg" width="558" height="419" /></center>

Well, for once, I'm actually doing something this Christmas. After two years of night shifts on the copy desk, I'm spending a week with my family in Ohio. It's pretty fabulous, but it took a hell of a lot of aggravation and stress to get where I am this Christmas Night. As I imparted just yesterday to a friend...

<blockquote>I left in time for my flight, but not before an absolutely hellish experience. For one, I must have hit something in the road with my car in the hours before I left for the airport because my fender has been bent which has made opening the driver's side door an excruciating experience. I have no idea how this happened, and since I had to leave at 2 a.m. Sunday morning for the Los Angeles airport, I had no time to deal with it.

Then the cat got out an hour before I had to leave. I had to wake up my roommate to help me look for him and leave slightly late before he showed up shivering at the door. (Oh, and I had to double back to get my "Showgirls" DVD, which I will be watching with my mother over the holiday).

And on top of all this, the scary movie fog emerged in Tulare County at 7 p.m. Saturday night, making my drive down Highway 99 an absolutely horrific experience. I survived, made my flight, but sadly my Sunday was consumed by 20-minute naps and a flight experience akin to the sensations a small animal must feel being trapped in a cage.

But, after a harrowing week of breaking news related to the Tulare County Sheriff's detective's death and funeral (including 11- and 13-hour days on Thursday and Friday), this object is finally at rest.</blockquote>

And here's a Christmas treat courtesy of my good friend Suzanne.

<img alt="cashback.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/cashback.jpg" width="300" height="444" class="imageright" />I don't do this often enough...

I watched a movie tonight that I thought was very good. I don't know when I got the urge to rent <em>Cashback</em>, a 2006 film adapted from the Acedemy Award-nominated short film of the same name, but I think it had something to do with iTunes. One of those advertisements you see in the iTunes Store maybe. One day, I saw it, and it was trying to rear me towards a catalog of short films nominated for the 2006 Academy Awards. I think I clicked on <em>Cashback</em>, watched a preview, and then filed said memory away.

It could be that. Or it could have something to do with Sean Biggerstaff, the Scottish actor perhaps best known for his role as Gryffindor Quidditch team captain Oliver Wood, the main attraction of the <em>Harry Potter</em> films, at least for me. Anyways, I made it a note to rent Cashback and I finally got around to it tonight.

The film is excellent. It was a beautiful film that artfully weaves in fantasy and reality without coming off as a hokey as a comic book film or fantasy/horror picture. On top of that, the cinematography is beautiful and the actors are very likable.

Sorry, I'm a bit rusty at this, but here goes...

The film centers around Ben Willis, an art student living in the UK who has just ended things with his girlfriend. After a few days, her quick recovery over their relationship leaves him winded and heart broken, and Ben develops chronic insomnia. Not hard to believe, of course. How cruel a world do we live in that we are denied sleep as an escape from the thorns of a bitter break up?

Anyways, Ben decides that, since he's got an extra eight hours every day to burn, he might as well get some cash for it. As a result he takes a night job at Sainbury's supermarket, along with a slate of other wily characters who flee to the nocturnal hours in their own vain attempts to pass the time. 

Ben also finds safe harbor in this place, but he sees different opportunities for his time than hiding from clocks or horsing around. Time moves quickest for Ben when he freezes it — examining each second to uncover its deepest and most guarded beauty. The short film captured this unique story well, and it would seem to be the best place for such a story to remain. I think the 2006 film, however, expands on this narrative vein well and ultimately brings it to a poised and beautiful ending.

Yeah, I might be wrong. There was a lot of female nudity, but you did get to see Sean without his shirt on, so I think that balances it out. I'm well aware I probably have the minority opinion in this arena, but I liked the film. It's the first film in a while that's brought me here to rant about it. Also it's the first catch on Netflix that actually had my fingers on my temple instead of on my iPod or the kitty's head.

Maybe it's worth a spin, yes? Now if only I could see <em>Into The Wild</em> or <em>Control</em>.

Oh, and I'm still around! I'm planning an update very soon.

<img alt="control.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/control.jpg" width="300" height="442" class="imageright" />I've been dying to see this movie for months. And finally, the celluloid gods smiled down on me.

See, I live in a "small town." Well, it's not that small really, but it's far from what some might consider civilized society. I usually associate this with decent concert venues, a multitude of delicious restaurant fare (especially vegetarian) and most importantly a decent independent cinema. I mean, come on! I lived in Dayton, Ohio, the armpit of American civilization (and interestingly enough my birthplace), and even they had a kick ass independent cinema!

Well, Visalia finally brought a decent independent film to town. At the beginning of the month, <em>Control</em> came to town. For two nights only, the black-and-white film by noted photographer Anton Corbijn, came to Visalia and I was front and center during the first showing. The film chronicles the formation and demise of the band Joy Division, a post-punk British rock band whose influence can be heard in many of the artists that climbed to prominance in the 80s and beyond.

The film focuses its narrative on Ian Curtis, the ill-fated lead singer who desperately wants to escape his drab life in Macclesfield, England. Soon after joining musicians Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner, Curtis finds what might be his golden ticket. After adding Stephen Morris and dropping the name Warsaw, Joy Division is born. The band rocket to success in England amongst contemporaries as the Sex Pistols and Iggy Pop.

Things turn sour for Curtis as he is diagnosed with epilepsy and has to undergo a brutal drug regiment in order to handle the demanding tour schedule of Joy Division. He also becomes swept up in a love affair with journalist Annik Honoré, causing significant strain with is wife Deborah Woodruff, who lives in Macclesfield with her and Curtis' daughter.

Of course, the plot of the film spirals to inevitable end of Curtis, who hangs himself on the eve of the band's American tour. This tragedy was a great blow to music, as the world will never know what potential Curtis would have had if he could have risen above his internal struggles. So true for other musicians as well.

What separates this film from the parade of other musical biopics is Corbijn, who has photographed and filmed musicians for much of his professional career. Responsible for album art such as U2's Joshua Tree and music videos such as Depeche Mode's "Personal Jesus," Corbijn makes this film just about the coolest I have every seen. The first half of the film feels like a photographer's portfolio, as even routine scenes of crossing the street are infused with such artistry that would take your breath away.

But the best thing about this film is the music. Not only does it introduce you to the wonderful band Joy Division, but also the artists which influenced the band's development. Oh, to live at the dawn of the 80s. I can think of so many worse things. If you have any sense in your brain, this will bring you back to the film over and over again.

The demise of Joy Division led Hook, Sumner and Morris to form New Order, which carried on in the shadow of Joy Division, influencing and changing the course of music in its own right. I've always been a fan of New Order, but not so much Joy Division. Happily, after this film, that has changed.

Pick this one up, definitely.

So I've been embroiled in a several month ordeal concerning my eventual matriculation to graduate school. Aside from the immediate concerns about my choices, this is something I've wanted to do a long time. I was actually planning to do in in the fall of 2007, but I got started a bit late, so I had to wait an extra year. Well, this year, I stepped to the plate. And in the last month I've been given some options.

Basically, I'm interested in getting a masters in journalism from one of the top schools in the country. I picked some good ones — the University of Southern California Annenberg School of Communication, the University of California Berkeley School of Journalism and the University of Missouri-Columbia School of Journalism. And I got into all three.

It's wonderful! In fact, I got into USC and UC Berkeley on the same day. It was really trippy. Missouri admitted me on March 10th. Once the excitement died down, I was faced with a surprisingly difficult question: Now what?

So let's look at the choices:

Today there was a bombshell: Naraku, the villainous antagonist in the Inuyasha manga, has been annihilated! With one shot of Kagome's arrow, he's been finished.

Oh, yeah, I think it was a few months ago that I announced the untimely death of Kohaku, the one-time protector of the final Shikon jewel shard. Well, it turns out the little bastard survived (some loophole involving a dead miko's enduring light).

Well, Naraku is definitely dead, right? Well, that's hard to say. The coolest thing about Naraku's death is it appears he's taking Kagome with him. A few issues back, Naraku's last remaining detachment, Byakuya of the Mirage, used his mysterious blade to cut Kagome. It had recently absorbed Inuyasha's Meidou attack, which dispatches an enemy straight to hell. Mysteriously, Byakuya's attack didn't do anything. For the past three issues, everyone has been waiting anxiously to see what wound he had inflicted.

As Naraku fought desperately against the combined force of the Inutachi and Sesshomaru, he finally faced the purity of Kagome's arrow, allowing his body and the jewel to at last be purified. Earlier in the battle, Kagome mused about the true purpose of Naraku's quest to gather the jewel shards. What wish did he want the jewel the grant? The woman he truly wanted, Kikyo, was dead, so that wish was not granted.

As Naraku hovered above the well through which Kagome magically appeared, returning the jewel to the feudal era, he conceded that his true wish could not be granted, so he made another. His wish would be granted the moment his life was extinguished. As it turns out, Byakuya's strike was integral to this wish: With Naraku dead, a path to hell opens behind Kagome.

OMG, how cool is this manga? This is freakin' Hades and Persephone! What is going to happen next?!

I'll be sure to tell. The manga is on the verge of ending, possibly in the next two months! Sadness :'(

<img alt="lastinu.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/lastinu.jpg" width="300" height="900" class="imageright" />Our lives are full of different distractions that bring us joy. I have been lucky to stumble on a few, many of which continue to distract and amuse. I enjoy listening to the band garbage, though they remain in what seems like an endless hiatus. I have seven seasons of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" to watch here at home, though a new comic book series named "Season 8" has continued this obsession for me. But, for the last six years, I have enjoyed a different kind of pop culture delight: Inuyasha.

It started for me as a late night excuse to avoid homework. I was still a college student at the University of Georgia and like many of my peers I would stay up late watching Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. At 12:30 a.m. every night, Inuyasha would come on, and as much as I resisted, I soon became sucked into the story. The anime cartoon chronicled the adventures of Kagome, a middle school student in Tokyo who stumbles upon the entryway to a door to the past — the feudal era of Japan, 500 years in the past to be exact. There she resurrects a half demon, Inuyasha, and together they go on a "collect the pieces" quest, which is an often repeated story gimmick in Japanese manga.

Well, it's been over 11 years and about two years since I picked up on the continuation of the manga version of Inuyasha, which is the ongoing storyline that the anime was adapted from. The past nine weeks have brought us the final volume of Inuyasha, where Naraku is finally killed and the Shikon Jewel is dealt with once and for all. It's sad to see the series end, but it's so refreshing that such a long standing story can be given such an appropriate send off.

Basically, if you're looking to be spoiled, Inuyasha and Kagome wish away the Shikon Jewel only to be separated by time again. As Kaede says, Kagome appeared with the Shikon Jewel and she disappeared with it as well. Three years pass and Kagome graduates high school, considering her future. She realizes why she has been unable to reach Inuyasha across time and makes the difficult decision in her heart to give up her live in the modern era and live permanently in feudal Japan.

The manga ends there, with epilogues revealing that Sango and Miroku marry and have three kids, Kohaku beginning to develop into a powerful demon slayer and Shippou training to become a powerful fox demon. The cutest part of the final chapter would have to be Kagome's heartfelt exchange with Inuyasha's older brother Sesshomaru, where she calls him brother-in-law. This is the perhaps the chapter's only clear implication that Kagome and Inuyasha have indeed decided to live on together romantically (though there other obvious implications that lead to this assumption). We're not given a kiss between the two, but their characters are allowed to drift happily into the sunset.

It might not be my chosen ending, but I'll take it. I always hoped that Naraku, the series antagonist, would live on forever coveting the Shikon Jewel. Kikyo, Inuyasha's resurrected ex-girlfriend, would curse him and drag him willingly to hell, the only place they could ever be together. Shattered and destroyed, Kagome would return to her time broken hearted, but forever remembering Inuyasha and regretting her sad fate. Thankfully for the fangirls and boys, that didn't happen.

I actually have a couple poems I wrote about the series Inuyasha, which I hope sometime I will bring to the surface of this incarnation of my Web site. For now, I've finally begun work on what may be my final poem about the anime/manga series, chronicling Kikyo's perspective of my vision of the fates of the series protagonists. I may save that for this blog or perhaps for my next blog's introduction. Who knows, we'll see.

Anyways, that's my sendoff for Inuyasha. It was a fabulous series and I will miss looking forward to a new and exciting chapter every week. Now what am I going to do!
