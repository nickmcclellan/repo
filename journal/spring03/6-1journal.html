<p>Quick update. Had my first day alone serving yesterday. I made $49 on a double :-/ That's pretty good, I guess, but it wore me out and at one point in the day I was freaking out. Oh well, I work again Thursday for dinner (hopefully busier than Tuesday) and I picked up a double on Sunday. I have a double on Saturday, so, WOW, hopefully these ravings about $400 a week will be heeded then. June 10th is coming...

<p align="center"><i>When I see you sky as a kite<br>
As high as I might<br>
I can't get that high<br>
The how you move<br>
The way you burst the clouds<br>
Makes me want to try...</i><br>

"High"<br>
The Cure</i></p>
<p>Hello again. Looks like another thin week, huh? Well, this has been a GOOD week! Last night, I was happy to see that my vacation money from Target has been moved to my checking account. This means I can pay my bills! Monday, I will MOST DEF be getting my car registration. Sorta can't get pulled over or else I get carted off to jail. That would suck, huh?</p>
<p>Anyways, quote is from this Cure CD Allyson gave to me (gee, I miss her...) and it sorta hit me as something I wanted to share. Sometimes I feel like I'm dark and jaded. This last semester--this whole college experience--has revealed for me just how lacking I am sometimes. I think I'm prone to do the right thing, but I'm not oblivious to the fact that I'm missing something. Sometime, along the way, I lost my innocense. Not sure when that happened. Some people, though...some people are just <i>serene</i> (I keep coming back to that word). Some people are so amazing, I just feel like a million dollars thinking about how blessed I am to bring them joy, any type of happiness. God, that makes me feel good. These persons (or person) are amazing, adorable, precious, but try as I might, I can't get that high...</p>
<p>Cingular pissed me off today. I remember the days when my bill was so perfectly cheep, either I'm talking more or they are shafting me somehow. Definitely going to drop them in February. Made $20 at lunch today, $50 last night! Thank you MATT, JOHN, AND BARRY! They came and FREAKED THE HELL OUT OF ME visiting me at my new job. OMG, I lost all focus, seeing people I know does that for me at work I guess. They are all awesome!</p>
<p>Got to spend time with Matt, the person I'm dating. Yah, fun times, we browsed Borders and looked at all the pretty things we'd like to own but would never buy from Borders because they overprice EVERYTHING. At least I got to buy him lunch...hehehe ;-)</p>
<p>I have a double today (sorta mid-double as I type) I work tomorrow for dinner and a double on Sunday. After that, I work Monday dinner, off Tuesday, dinners all week except for a double Friday and then I'm off next Sunday! Expect to see me Athens side the week after next. Gotta make my contribution to Lambda.</p>
<p>Ok peeps, gotta munch on some cookie dough before I start serving all those T-Mac folks once more. If I see you tonight, DON'T tip me less than $5, got too many $3 tips last night...WTF?!</p>
<p>Adios playas

<div class="post">
<p>...wow, isn't Sharon Osbourne's outfit on the MTV Movie Awards reminiscent of Shirley's outfit in the video for "Androgyny"? I THINK SO! Ok, proven, if you don't think Shirl is HOT, FUCK YOU!!!</p>
<p>Anyways, check out the Sherry Page. Got <a href="../../sherry/sc-02.html" target="_blank">Episode Two</a> up. It's much better than Episode One ;-) (Yah, I wonder who Mipsy emulates...)
