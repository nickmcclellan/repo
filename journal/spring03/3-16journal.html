<p>I just basically wanted to say that I will (HOPEFULLY) not be online while I'm kickin' it in the Big Easy. However, as my drunken state has frequently compelled me to, I may pop online sometime between Wednesday and Saturday night. I assure you, any appearances like this should be valued because I will most likely be very drunk (I'm getting Everclear!) so you should definitely IM me and let me harass you (or if you're ALREADY special, I will probably harass you anyways). IM me at basuraboi3, you know, if you see me.
