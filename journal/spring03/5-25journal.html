<p>Well, something was bound to launch me into an entry this week, so I guess THIS did it. Finally saw Chicago. Went to Hooters (for the scenery). Got hot chocolate in the summer. Fumbled with fingers in a dark theater. Made out to "So Like a Rose." It was more amazing then I would think (and I didn't think, I couldn't even guess). So that's the scoop.</p>
<p>Note to self: do something good for Barry and Stefanie (especially Stef). Honestly, Lily is the only pussy I love to rub all over my face. Second note to self: scoop dead squirrel that that murderous bitch April killed out of the driveway and maybe into the back yard. Oh, and tomorrow...gonna show my sister Kennesaw Mountain.</p>
<p>Ok, I refuse to get all pensive and self-reflecting. I need to sleep. Let's just say Matt rocks--he's a marvel of modern technology. I'll leave it at that. Adios.</p>
<p align="center">"There's no going back / There's no going back / There's no going back on this one..."</p>

<p>I've done well entry wise since I've been home for the summer. I really haven't had much to write about. Also, I have been busy. Today is my first day working at Taco Mac. It feels like a worthless day though. I have no idea how long I'm going to be Taco Mac-ing. I figure as late as 7 p.m. Maybe later! Maybe sooner :-/ I think I'm doing some customer service class. WHATEVER, I rock at customer service. "It's one test I think I'll actually pass."</p>
<p>Anyways, I've titled this beautiful week "No Going Back on This One" because I think it was last night that I realized that something ended a long time ago and it's time I let it go. I don't know, I just need to let things go, maybe. Well, I think I was just shocked that I finally did let certain things die. I don't know what I'm talking about...this has nothing to do with anything recent, anything that matters, just old things. Maybe I'll write a poem about it...I think that's the only way I'd make any sense.</p>
<p>Alright! Time to make some money.

<p align="center"><i>I thought I recognized your face<br>
Amongst all those strangers<br>
But I am a stranger now<br>
Amongst all the recognized...</i></p>
<p align="center">"Are You a Hypnotist?"<br>
The Flaming Lips</p>
<p>I can't help but get really excited when I hear a Lips song. You know, the normal shuffle, anything from Yoshimi. Sure, "Summertime"'s alright, and "Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots" parts one and two are fun, but I'm talking about the songs that really hit me. The second refrain of "Fight Test" always has me clinching my fist and screaming out, "...and the starlight begins! / It's all a mystery!" The above example, a line from "Are You a Hypnotist?" has me swimming around the words "stranger now." I just close my eyes and wonder...</p>
<p>Hence the change of title. Clever, huh? Anyways, lots going on. Yah, I was all happy from my date on Tuesday, that was a whole lotta fun, but that's sorta inherent when you're with someone you think is really cool and awesome, and cute and adorable, and blah blah, nobody understands me and this fluffy goodness, so yah, here goes. I'm dating Matt Stephens! I don't care what drama ensues, everyone that matters I've already told, and I just feel so cool about it, I don't care if random internet stalkers have some idea what makes me feel groovy (I know, I'm corny)</p>
<p>Well, to attack our boring humdrum homes, Missy and I ventured to Athens to party. She refused to see that adorable fish movie with me, hence me being dragged to Athens to go to the Annex. It was great, alot of fun, we danced and I tapped that ass. Also, have another inside joke phrase to add to the likes of, "Want to come inside Mary Lyndon?" How about, "Can I suck your thumb?" NO, MISSY! NO!</p>
<p>Got to see Matt despite my fears that he would think that I went to Athens just for him--I didn't want to intrude on his party or his Friday out, but Missy and I needed a place to stay and he was the logical conclusion. He helped us out, and I got to see him, and I got the hunch that he really didn't feel that intruded upon, which is cool, cause I like him, and I wanted to see him.</p>
<p>In other news, will be taking my server final tomorrow at Taco Mac. Can you believe that I have to STUDY??? Yup, I have to get a 90% on the test or else I can't be a server. Assuming I pass, I will start working officially as a full-fledged server on Tuesday. I have some doubles this week, and let me tell you, I'm excited about doing as much as I can to make as much money as possible before this summer is done and gone. I'm so sick of this month, forever to be known as my BROKE ASS wasted month. Not June though, hell no. You'll see, I'm going to be all reinvested and refreshed. It's coming! And his name is Benjamin! AND HE HAS FRIENDS!!!</p>
<p>Next week: first full week of Taco Mac-ing. Insert fun activity on Friday, possibly trip to Athens? Also, insert hiking excursion with Missy on Wednesday. Helping my aunt Monday. Runing ONE DAY, at least. Gotta get back on the ball, am feeling so ugly today. Ok, well, I'm off then! Dad's making barbeque chicken, and I'm starved! Also, running on another 3 and a half hours of sleep (yah, the Athens visit last night was not planned well...was late to work this morning). I'll sleep lata though, sleep is just nothing, man, it's NOTHING. Nothing I can seem to care about right now.</p>
