<p>My face is healing very nicely. I actually no longer scare small children. Did good tonight I guess. Hoping this weekend I can do a good job money wise. Haven't been holding onto as much as I held onto last year. This worries me, but I am hearing that my dad will be in a better position to help me, so that should be good.</p>
<p>Sad news. Two of my most favorite people are leaving very soon. John leaves tomorrow for Maryland. On Monday, Matt, John, and I saw the Wizard of Oz at the Fox Theater and I believe it was a better send off than the party that I burned my face off at. I will miss him so much, it's not fair. Why do they good ones leave and the pretentious pricks remain. Nicole has just informed me that she will be departing Marietta in one week for her trek to France. The next time I will have a chance to see her would have to be a visit to France. Will try that, definitely. Haven't been to France in a while.</p>
<p>I saw Charlie Armstrong today at work. I haven't seen him since I was in 8th grade. It was so awesome, he was such a good friend back then. We talked a bit. He's working at Outback with April. He actually came to see me Tuesday but I was in Athens. What a cool guy, I wonder "what if's" sometimes, and what if we had kept in touch. He seems like he would have been a really valuable friend.</p>
<p>I changed last week's journal entry title to "Flaming Lips" because, HELLO, so much more appropriate than "Mouthful of Fire", and The Flaming Lips rock, and now I am known for their namesake. Yey!</p>
<p>Two things. I hate talking on IM when I dial up. REMEMBER THIS. Second thing. I want Mario Kart Double Dash so bad, I would kill to get it. I will kill you with turtle shells FO SHO.

<p>I can't wait to see Tomb Raider with Genevieve. It is the next thing I'm looking forward to.</p>
<p>Had a good night I think. I'm naming this week "Bad Karma" because sometimes I don't deserve much. I really don't feel like getting too much into stuff. I'm really tired. It might be early Sunday morning. I might have to work tomorrow night. Sleep...now all I wanna do.
