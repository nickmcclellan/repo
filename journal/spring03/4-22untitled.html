<p class="Nick" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a cat--or is he?  Maybe oafish...he's more an oaf, an ogre with whiskers.  Anyways, like an oafish feline freak, he pursues, peruses his options, with the fickleness of a feline and the clumsiness and insipid manner of an oaf.  That insipid indolent!  Very much so, he knows, they call him out on it, the random butterflies, mosquitoes--some sorts of insects, maybe with more then eight legs.  They land on his back, reminding him constantly, not that they are there and they can see, but that he is there where he doesn't belong and is known by his options.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Options.  His insipid oafishness, an error, a fault, he knows, but much like the cat, he sets up his defense--simple denial.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what you're talking about," the kitten roars, rolling about on his belly, giggling on the inside, smiling on the out.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they rocket back and forth, from left to right, waiting at times for this oaf to capture them, give them some sort of affirmation, whether that be advantageous or just a pipe dream.  They wait, other times snatched away from the kitten, who grumbles, moves onto a new option.  They waffle--but not like waffles, they don't flip and sizzle.  They rock back and forth, in indecision, amongst the paws of power--the claws of oafs--restless in the palms of ogres.
