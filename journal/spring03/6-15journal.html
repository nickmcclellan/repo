<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, June 17th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Bet you didn't think I'd do an entry this week? Well, I had an entry going THURSDAY NIGHT, but my computer crashed, so it disappeared. Fuck that, right? Well, I'll focus on my trip to Athens this week, for now. More on this week next week (maybe).</p>
<p>So on Monday I drove down to Athens with Rachel. Turned out my good friend's power was CUT OFF in her apartment. That's what happen when you don't PAY YOUR BILLS. She's cool though, gonna stick it out in Athens. I'll see her in a week or two.</p>
<p>After dropping her off w/ Bill, I left to see Matt and Missy. It was raining real hard. We watched Double Dare and Legends of the Hidden Temple at Missy's apartment. Then we left. Monday night consisted mostly of hanging out...fun times.</p>
<p>Tuesday was great. I picked up random stickers for my laptop and my Taco Mac book. Come to Taco Mac. Observe my bunny sticker. BY FAR the best. Got a WIRELESS INTERNET CARD! Went all around Matt and Stef's apartment complex looking for a wireless connection and FOUND ONE! Can you believe it? For about two seconds I was online WITHOUT A CORD. I IMed Charlie. It was a dream come true...had to dash as the apartment occupant went out to smoke...didn't want to get caught Internet mooching...</p>
<p>Tuesday culminated with a big reunion of sorts at Blue Sky. It was awesome. Got to hang out with all my bestest friends! (Wireless Downtown was down...needless to say, I was very much brassed off...)</p>
<p>Wednesday was cool too. I went out to dinner with the Pad. Hung out with Gen. Had a board meeting. Talked to Leena. Haven't talked to Leena in a while, I'm sorry to say I had to do it at Missy's while everyone was getting ready to get drunk and go out. FUNNIEST MOMENT OF THE EVENING: Missy storms in on me and Leena, falls flat on her face before us. Wanted to roll on the floor, but I too was getting very toasted. Leena is the first person I will call the next time I'm Athens-side.</p>
<p>Shit, I wish I could say more, but I really have to run now. I will write more soon...Later all</p>
