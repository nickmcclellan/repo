<div class="post">
<p>I had a good day today (I actually just wrote a shitload about it but my computer crashed, losing everything I wrote). Yah, thanks for that.</p>
<p>Apologies. Anyways, I remember writing that my good day started like most days do. At 12 a.m. I've been working like a mad man on my webpage. Last night I made my new link bar. I also put together my new blog page. I started working on the site when my sister and I were waiting for our plane to arrive in Dayton on Monday afternoon. I set up the last several months of journals with their new page. It's all very exciting. You can IM me for a preview link ;-)</p>
<p>I was going to call it a night then, but I ventured to the living room to hang out with Jen and Sheik and his friends. Sheik kicked my ass at Smash Bros. on my Gamecube, which got me to thinking I should probably rip him a new one in Mario Kart. I did just that :-) It was awesome watching his friends run in fear from Yoshi "The Killer." Sheik's described the feeling as "sweating while running from the cops." I had tears streaming down my face, it was so funny. No one realizes exactly how much Mario Kart makes me happy.</p>
<p>(Just want to let the world know, at this point, my computer has crashed several times. It will be a miracle if I ever get this journal published) Well, I woke up this morning, stalling my trip to my Aunt's so that I could wait for my Homestar Runner shirts to arrive from UPS. I eventually wised up and made my way to East Cobb. My mother called on the way over, she got a job! She's going to be working at Kettering Hospital, where I was born. She's working with a clinic that does the procedure where obese people get their stomachs stapled. She's very excited. I'm excited because it means she can support me during the school year. Money's been tight...</p>
<p>I worked my ASS off at my Aunt's. I moved just about every box in her garage upstairs. It was alot of work. I'm really glad I got to help her out. I protested alot, but I couldn't help but recieve $100 from her. It's really not the reason I go over there, I'm serious!</p>
<p>Oh, yah, and if I didn't mention it, today was also good because I got my Homestar Runner t-shirts. I got a blue collar Stinkoman shirt, a Pom Pom shirt (sorry Alex), a Homsar shirt (my favorite, I'm wearing it now), and the famous Trogdor shirt (ask to see the Trogdor picture my friends from Taco Mac drew for me). Yah, fun times, man.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think that's it for me, for now. This will be my last journal for the Spring/Summer 2003 bunch. You know, I'll maybe do another entry before the week's out. You'll see. The new theme will be officially unveiled with a full week's journal on August 10th (after my move). Next week my Blog page will be new, you'll get to see the theme then. Oh, exciting! Maybe not for you.</p>
<p>I hate you Kenny</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, August 2nd...</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>So this is it. The last journal of Summer 2003 (well, I'm assuming it will still be summer tomorrow and also for the next couple of weeks, but this will be the last journal on this chunk of my life). Exciting.</p>
<p>Tonight, during the latter part of the longest shift I ever had at Taco Mac, I pondered what form this last entry would take. I really just don't know. I don't know what to talk about. I don't know what happened to that perfect summer. How it seemed like I had a plan and conviction, but just like everything it has dwindled away, spread to the many different corners of my life.</p>
<p>I won't get into broken promises and failures though. That's not what this is about. I think it's about pride, and more than just Pride. Honestly, that was the best week. I look at that tacky piece of shit spinning around my rear view mirror in my car, and I remember that week. I remember arriving at Genevieve's place, bitching to her and Marilia about Taco Mac. I remember saving Marilia from the bum in Piedmont Park who called us all faggots because I wouldn't let Marilia ask him for money. I remember walking the park w/ Matt and tearing apart that damn Lambda booth. I also remember the week that followed. Looking for Fray at Junkman's. Eating desserts at Chili's with Matt's roommates. Dealing with the drama of the hour (at that time, Matt Pillion). Also, getting drunk at Aiman's and playing Truth or Dare. Fun times. All fun times.</p>
<p>Pride for other reasons though. I told my father that I took alot of Pride in helping the family this summer. I sorta feel that way, though I wish he would take more pride in helping me through college. I feel that I've grown very close to my sister this summer, and we became a family unit without parental figures that could function successfully and depend on eachother. I take tons of pride in that. Also, I'm proud of what I did for my aunt this summer. I moved her out of that huge house in Roswell to a smaller one down the road. I swear, I had my hands on everything she owned, and she is very grateful. I'm prideful of the friends I've made this summer. Amber, Bethani, Dijana, Fiona, Bibi, April, and I'm sure tons of others. Oh, yah, I take alot of pride in the money I made ;-)</p>
<p>(BTW, when I said, "I hate you Kenny", I wasn't refering to any one person, I was refering to that specific quote from <i>South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut</i>) This summer has also been to me a very musically interesting one. I guess it all started with that Toga Luau mix that really blew, honestly. After that, I got really into Allyson's Cure CD. Fiona loaned me the Cure's All Mixed Up CD. That really rocked. The song of this summer is definitely <i>The Caterpillar</i>. I'd go as far as to say that the Cure is second only to garbage. I hope to get more into the Cure, cause I like what I hear.</p>
<p>What else...well, this summer I dated Matt. I know I haven't wrote much about it, because honestly, I've learned that it's really tacky to write shit like that in your journal...ESPECIALLY your internet journal. I love Matt, that's important. He's something special to me, and if I choose to hold onto that and not dole it out to everyone I can, that's my choice. It doesn't make it any less special. I just think the whole "boyfriend" thing is so weak. Matt doesn't define me, and I sure hope I don't define him. It's just there, and by some miracle, it remains. I figure the fall will be a challenge. Maybe, as this whole messy love thing goes on, I'll have more to share, but I just feel like it's important to say that this summer would have been very different if I didn't have such a cool guy like Matt to tool around with.</p>
<p>Oh, what else...I guess I wish Jeremy was still around. He's too damn cool to spend a number of months away from. Fuck that.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is through. How did you like it? Since the 5th of January, it's seemed like I've lived the same month over and over again, waiting for something different. Waiting for what I was promised. I don't know if I've learned something, maybe this month will never end. Maybe things are going to change so much, my life will morph itself some new crisis, and I'll be so focused on it, I won't even remember want sent me for a spiral. Who knows. I'm ready though, I'm ready to go. I'm ready to start this adventure all over again.</p>
<p>Next week, I return to Athens. The two most important people to me in the world, I think, will be there (maybe for a while). Missy and Gen. The still beating heart of my college life. Lastly, I'd like to say I take the most pride in that. I love my friends. I couldn't smile without them, I couldn't open my eyes if I knew I'd never see them again. They are my strength, my affirmation. No matter what anyone tells you, the one thing you're looking for, ever, in any situation, is support in love. No matter where you get it. Superfurious S. O. Warm-hearted manager-type. Forgotten hope. No matter where, you'll find it in your friends. You won't remember, but if you stop and think about it, remember that. It's the last place you'll look, everytime.</p>
<p>So that's it. That's all. Go away, reflect on it all. Sure, things could have been better, but they could have been worse. Give me a call, I'll fill you in folks. Tune in the 10th! Update!!!</p>
