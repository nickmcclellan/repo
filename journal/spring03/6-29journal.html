<p>Pride was good fun. I volunteered. I did my part. I feel all achieved and good. And also pink.</p>
<p>Friends rock. Honestly, it was my friends that helped me get through Pride. I was fearful at first. I got through it. Matt came today. It was great, we collected at a park enterance near Piedmont Rd. We were really successful. Good job.</p>
<p>Wanted to do an entry, but now I think I'm so exhausted and just Interneted out, I don't know what it is. It was a good weekend. Blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I've been so into the Cure lately. "Pictures of You" is so cool. I'm listening to it now. I hear "Just Like Heaven" and it makes me so happy. You have no idea. I'm not garbage-flavored anymore, I promise you. Been branching out. What's next? I want to know.</p>
<p>Anyways, I plan on sitting at Blue Sky this week at least once and go all wireless (I hear that's up again). Come see me or at least read my nifty away message. Please. It's my dream.</p>
<p>Dream on</p>

<p>This last week has been really amazing. I really didn't realize it until tonight, but this last week has been so amazing. I did Pride for the first time ever. I tabled again for the orientations in Athens and also dealt with some problems with the Lambda Board (It's being taken care of). I spent time with Matt. On Wednesday, we all went to Boneshakers, but I couldn't move beyond the couch because I was talking to him. In retrospect, I said alot of things that didn't really need to be said, but whatever. I am just hopeless, absolutely hopeless...</p>
<p>My quest for varied music selection met a very interesting development this week. On Monday, I went to dyke night with Gen and Matt to see a local Athens music artist Heidi Hensley. She was very good! My favorite song of hers is "Just Monday Morning." I listened to it alot on the way to work today. It's really cool, it's fun.</p>
<p>I think I did really good at work tonight. Got home and have been playing Ms. Pacman with Jen and Bibi. Would be doing it now, but my time is obviously here. I need to go to bed. Let's do that. Very tired. Missing my person, you know, that person, that really cool person to whom I pale in comparison.</p>
<p>"Nightingale" because I couldn't think of anything better. I wanted something with "Dream", but I thought it would sound too lame. I decided on "Nightingale" maybe because of that whole exchange between Romeo and Juliet about the Nightingale and the Lark. Well, the Lark eventually. Someday.</p>
<p>Maybe that's something that belongs to no one. Someday. I thought maybe that day had come, cause like I pointed out before, maybe some days come again. Well, it hasn't come. But I could feel it, something, it was there. I wasn't ready for it. He wasn't either. We don't need to be.  We're gonna just let that one go. It's gone. Yah, the nightingale is here, and we've got all night my friend. All night long...
