<h2 class="date-header">Monday, March 10th...12:36AM</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I feel very good. The "Party Weekend" is now over. Week 1 of "Get-My-Ass-In-Gear" begins. This weekend leaves me feeling very good. Despite all the reasons I should feel absolutely horrible, I feel very nice, actually, I am happy in this moment right now.</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, since before I think I even came to UGA possibly, I feel happy for no reason besides my own earned self-esteem. It's not because I partied, got drunk, and had a great time. It's not because I'm dating anyone. It's not because I don't have any tests or that I got over some "molehill" issue. It's because things remain very well despite how things really are. I should be miserable, boarded up in some library somewhere stressing my brains out...but I'm not. I don't really care, actually. I'll deal with things when I'm ready and I have true faith that things will be alright in the end. Faith is an important theme with my whole status right now. I have alot of faith, and that doesn't seem as scary as it should.</p>
<p>Saturday night was interesting. I was less of a hardcore drinker, I sorta took it in slowly. I don't think I'll be hardcore drinking for a while. There doesn't seem to be much reason to. If I go out Wednesday (which I think I should do) I will not drink. I will drive and be responcible and FACE THE MUSIC...because I can now. I can do it because I have faith in myself to overcome any obstacle. If I could describe how I feel figurativly, I'd say I'm on the otherside of Thursday, at last. That feels very nice, actually.</p>
<p>Before I head to bed, I will be even more vaguely figurative. I looked rather feverishly tonight for Orion, but I couldn't find it. For the first time, I don't think it's on my horizon. Anywhere. Those stars have set.</p>
<p>...I was thinking, walking back from Parkes this morning, I know too much. I don't know nearly enough. I was reminicing on when I was younger. I remembered the random mind games I would play with my family. I would uncover something, something stupid, you know, I'd overhear in an argument or something, and I'd remember that. It would be referenced in a future exchange I would be having with a member of my family and I would pretend I had forgotten. Pretend I had forgotten. I can't do that any longer. I feel like I know way too much that I can't pretend that I don't know this much. I can't even pretend that, at the heart of things, I know nothing.</p>
<p>I know so much random shit, it's overwhelming. God, I know so much it is just infuriating, intoxicating, and I continue to amass this ball of nonsense, pawning it off as substancial, but it's very much useless. I think I'm going to do it though, I'm going to get smart, one of these days. This morning, in my sleeplike spance of thirty minutes between 6:30 and 7, I thought about my paper for Trivedi and the presentation too. I could visualize how I'm going to get it done. I'm actually so oddly charged about it I'm going to go spend the time before Spanish at the library reading up on Seventeenth Century perceptions of death just so Trivedi knows I'm serious about this assignment. I am. I want to do my absolute best to prove that I can be an English major and that I can GET SMART. I can do it, I can achieve.</p>
<p>Anyways, random knowledge. You could call it gossip, I suppose, I have my sources. I feel like when I walk by someone I know there is this cloud of thoughts that surround them...thoughts of all these things I know about them that they have no idea about. Sometimes it's so obvious, I can't even see the person, I can only see these distinct unknown perceptions of them. It's overwhelming, and I've just been juggling it for so long, I don't know how I'm supposed to deal with it. I probably won't, honestly, it's sort of addicting and calming to know more about someone then they think you do. It's just, I wish they had some idea. I wish they knew I was this smart, though I appear that stupid.

<p>Sigh...I told Jeff how I felt about our "situation." I won't go into details, I will just say I told him that saying as friends is probably the best way to go. I sense that continuing with something that I didn't have all my heart in would just leave him really hurt, and I don't want to do that. I do care about him and really am glad I got a chance to be honest with him. He's got alot to look forward to. I just felt like if I continued things with him I'd just suck the life out of him or something morbid like that...he felt something for me and if I can't reciprocate that, I have to let him know. Anyways, he knows and he'll feel better, and I won't have sucked the life out of him...cause that would be wrong!</p>
<p>Well, this has nothing to do with anything...really, this Jeff thing has reminded me of something I stored away for a time like this...I feel like it's time I shared this with anyone who cares. <a href="http://www.geocities.com/yoshi369/1-16allyson.html">Click here to see.</a></p>

<p>Wow..."Cup of Coffee" seems morbidly appropriate...I totatlly didn't plan that, just came across the quiz on the garbage message board this afternoon...I can't help it if I'm morbid!

<p>Ah, it was so nice not drinking for a change at Boneshakers last night. I felt so clean walking out...I didn't smell bad, I hadn't offended alot of people. I did offend Ray though, I shouldn't have picked her up wearing a skirt...sigh. Proceeded to dance fuck Charlie while not intoxicated proving I could rock his world at any time. Sonya and Ilya came and had alot of fun. It's nice getting out with them. I don't get to do that much with them, but they promised me future Wednesdays, which will be alot of fun. I also did the scandelous dancing with Evan, but the floors were slippery...I don't think I was very scandelous, just very careful to not fall on my ass. Um, yah, that's the most of it.</p>
<p>As far as today and the rest of the week goes, I'm not so busy. Today, I'm going to lunch and then class...I hope we don't discuss my loser short story. I submitted that Garfield thing of which I'm not very proud of...I stink at short stories. After that, I will hopefully get to see Missy and talk to her, I really want to. After that, I will go to Blue Sky for socializing and mostly studying. Not much to study though, so it should be relatively stress free. Tomorrow, I'm going to class and such. I've got to check out books for my Trivedi term paper. I want to have an idea on a thesis by the end of the break. At noon, I'm going to redecorate the Lambda office. Then at 6ish, I'm going to ride back to ATL with Jeremy and hopefully Rachel. We're going to John's party on Friday night. I'm taking my sister, I hope she has a fun time. I'm taking Jeremy to the airport on Saturday, and then my break will begin!</p>
<p>We don't go to New Orleans until Wednesday morning, so until then I will be working on my term papers and I will also take a break with the massage certificate my Dad got me for Christmas.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm feeling much better then earlier in the week. I had a nasty bout with Pink Eye which really only lasted one day, but it's over now...it's so gross! The only thing is I keep getting headaches...I don't know why. Anyways, I should probably get ready for lunch. Later folks...

<p>One little side note before I trek down to Park Hall...Next week's journal shall be delayed and published on Sunday. Like I did last year, it will be a huge Spring Break 2003 journal that will hopefully include pictures eventually. We'll see. Just don't expect to be staking me over the break...but call me, there are still other forms of communication then blog. Alright, later.

<h2 class="date-header">The Ides of March</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Prepare for a very interesting entry. I feel charged and ready to write! I will start with a description of the evening (John's Party) and I will then trail off into whatever silly thing I've decided to be my "issue" at this moment. Then I will probably sum up rather quickly and leave you salivating for more (but your thirst will not be quenched until after the break). Oh well, so here goes...</p>
<p>I guess it all started when Jeremy, Rachel, and I left Athens to go home. I am so very odd sometimes...the things I choose to talk about. Our conversation centered on the gay man's facination with penis. We branched off from there into many odd tangets. All in all it was alot of fun. Jeremy seemed very quiet, I must admit, I think he was tired. Fellows probably should have rested before his trek to ITALY. He'll have fun...</p>
<p>Jeremy and I had dinner with my dad and sister at Taco Mac. This was alright, it's fun throwing inside jokes back and forth between unsuspecting parents. Pre-party preparations included guiding Missy, Sonya, and Ilya on a pointless exbidition to my house. I should have just given them directions to the party, I'm really sorry about that. Anyways, I got to open my Three Colors Trilogy DVD set. Hopefully I will be watching <i>Red</i> tonight, rediscovering my most favorite movie. Jeremy, Jen, and I sat around waiting for Missy and all to show up. My dad had a date...don't care to say much about that though. Jen let us bring this Raspberry Vokda stuff to the party, it was actually a real hit. We finally made our way down to this "party" after I got a disturbing phone call from Matt and "God" (who turned out to be a drunk Evan).</p>
<p>The party was alot of fun. I was greeted by John who was very obviously GONE. I knew any conversing with him would be a waste of time (he didn't remember much). I wonder, has there been times when I appeared like that? It's scary...sober is so much better, really. Anyways, I had to guide my sister through everyone...they were all so interested in seeing her because I talk about her alot. She's very cool, but I think she should have brought a friend or something because she got bored and eventually left. Getting drunk with my sister was a disappointment...though I did twirl her around as I promised. Getting drunk with all my friends was much more interesting. Evan seemed very excited as well, but I think he found most interesting the fact that his "clone" attended the party. This guy Jason, I swear, is like exactly like Evan in every way making me wonder if Evan is part of some strange subculture or something. They even wore oddly similar metal rings on their fingers. It was very cool seeing Evan get it on with the clone...well, or I should say distant cousin at least...they really didn't look that much alike.</p>
<p>Missy and I had alot of fun dancing and stuff. I got really sweaty for some reason, probably from picking alot of people up. I'd have to say the best pick up of the night was Matt. I saw him from across the room, his legs spread...in the perfect position for me to swoop in under him and hoist him onto my shoulders. He was certainly surprised, but always safe. I would never harm my Nice Matt...not in a million years. Putting Missy on my shoulders was also alot of fun...she was so scared! Sonya too, actually...she thought I was going to toss her through the glass doors. INSANE! I am actually laughing to myself right now. It was fun.</p>
<p>I stopped drinking when it got later and just let the buzz lure me into some sort of fatigue. Matt and I talked about stuff. This leads me to my "Praise Matt" section because Matt is truly amazing. I was talking to him about stuff, nothing too scary, but he was so incredibly touched (or drunk) that he shead a tear. It sort of lead us to that conversation about crying and I described the last time I ever cried. You know the one...Brandy died. I cried. We actually went into the rain and talked about it getting all soaked in the process. It was just very cool, I felt very close to Matt. I admire him so much, he's so much more then a "freshman" or "some guy at Lambda." He's really very special and amazing. He has something not many people have. He's very caring and modest and just incredible. It's almost funny listening to him wonder how he could mess up a relationship with Eric, there's no way. I mean, sure, sometimes things don't work out, but it would never be because of Matt. I think that caring for someone like Matt is not anything anyone can fuck up. It's a privledge. Matt's just got that going for him, and it's very cool. Matt is very amazing, and I love him, you know, in that mushy crying-in-the-rain, parading-him-around-on-shoulders, talking-about-dead-animals way. Matt is by far the most INTRIGUING person I've meet in a long time.</p>
<p>As far as issues, I can really only think of one that really has nothing to do with last night and everything to do with Wednesday. I saw Bryant on Wednesday. I actually saw him shortly after things had ended 2 months ago too, but I didn't talk to him then. Actually, he probably didn't even see me then, but we talked on Wednesday. It was very ODD, almost surreal. I saw him and just still don't have anything to say to him so I just went about my evening, sadly, ignoring him. He was nice enough to say hi though. Any and all exchanges I had with him that evening were very empty at least from my point of view. The thought of bumping into him has been looming for the longest time for me. I think somehow I knew I was going to see him Wednesday, or at least I anticipated it, well, obviously. I have been lately drinking on Wednesdays to numb any potential incidents involving him...I didn't drink on Wednesday though. I could have, but I choose not to. I had been feeling very over him and really figured if I did see him it wouldn't affect me. It really didn't. I didn't get all stone faced or shocked. I didn't stutter, I just sort of muddled through like anyone would. He seemed happy to see me at least, which is good I guess. On the other hand, he wasn't so happy to see me two months ago since he ended things so I was alittle perplexed by that, but Jeremy told me that he probably wanted to make sure things were cool between he and I. On that subject, I don't think things could be anything between he and I. I was never really his friend before our situation.</p>
<p>What would things between him and myself be anyways? I don't know what I would expect from a friendship with him. I have alot of friends now. There is nothing much in Bryant that I'm attracted to friendwise. Maybe that's why it was doomed to failure or something. Maybe I never had the opportunity to develop a friendship with him? Damned dependency got in the way of all that. It's tempting, but I would never pursue it. He would really have to decide something like that, I think. It's probably not a good idea. I really just wanted to have this really neat relationship with someone I thought was very different and aloof.</p>
<p>Aloof. That was the most attractive thing about him. He wasn't a part of anything I was familiar with, I never saw him normally. I had really only seen him once before when we decided to go out or whatever you could call what we did. In the last two months it's been comforting to trust that I wouldn't run into him randomly. We lived in different worlds. I think seeing him alot would have made things very difficult for me. Anyways, seeing him Wednesday did create ripples. He's a very different person to me now. I honestly don't like him that much anymore, at least as a person. I care alot about him though, that's very true. I don't know what I want with him. Nothing seems good. I deserve better then him, someone that is less fickle. Initially I wondered what it was that made him go from hot to cold so fast. God only knows, but I really don't care. It's just really sad things didn't work out. I am happy with how things did turn out though. I don't feel like I did intially. I thought the best thing about this semester was going to be exploring the nether regions of an amazing relationship. It turned out the coolest thing about this semester was realizing just how useless dependency can be.</p>
<p>It would be nice having a boyfriend. I want one. I just can't find anyone that can fit my expectations. I want a relationship that is not one of dependency. I want something that celebrates independence from eachother. Someone I could share things with. Someone that could introduce me to interesting things. You know, that all encompassing PERFECT guy. It's not going to happen soon, but for now I enjoy bobbing my head to New Order pondering what it will be like to be head over feet in love with someone. I'll have to see, eventually. Maybe, someday. (I write in code, can't you see it??)</p>
<p>Until next Sunday friends. Call my cell phone IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING TO SAY TO ME, OTHERWISE <B>DON'T CALL</B>! I will be in New Orleans and will thus be roaming. I'm leaving on Wednesday morning so feel free to call me any day before that, I'll be in Marietta working on my term paper, shopping with Missy, getting a massage, and hiking. Also consuming Thin Mint cookies! Yummy. Happy Spring Break all!
