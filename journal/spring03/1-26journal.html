<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, January 26th...Happy Birthday Jennifer!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I don't have much to say besides this. If you want to hear the funniest thing I have heard ALL YEAR (quite possibly the funniest thing of 2003) then you have to CALL ME and ask me to tell you about it. It's so big and awful, I can't transcribe it here...and besides, I love rolling on the ground laughing everytime I tell it.</p>
<p>Other then funniness, I'm doing just fine. We'll see how this week shapes up. Hope it's better then last week...I feel like having some fun. Later all.</p>
<p>BTW...January 28th is the one year anniversary of my Internet Journal! That means I've had my website for a whole year! I've had 1634 hits I think...so far. Almost 2000! That's pretty amazing. I had no idea I was that interesting. Well...It's fun looking at the old journals seeing how far I've gotten. I have so much more friends then just Missy and Gen, but they are still part of my inner circle. Well...you should check out the old journals sometime...they are pretty cool. Ok...leaving now.

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, January 29th...Happy Birthday Ilya!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I haven't written much this week...I was too busy Monday, and I felt like shit yesterday. It all started in my journalism class. I realized I felt really sore, like I was coming down with something. I started getting a dull headache. I went and got some Advil and felt better. As planned, I was going to go running with Missy in the afternoon. I was really upset because I really couldn't handle it as well as I did this weekend, it seemed like, GASP, I was getting shin splints again. Well, it seemed like it was getting better by the end of the run, so I didn't worry about it much. I got back and iced my shins anyways...then things got worse. I got the chills really bad (not from the ice, I really doubt). I went and took a shower...I was so cold, I must have taken a 30 minute shower. I came back to my room and I swear I had a fever. I just laid in bed and it just felt awful. Missy came down to check on me and Gen brought me some food. They spent some time with me to make sure I was alright. By the time Gen needed to leave, I decided I needed to get a thermometer. I was really freaked out, I thought it could be real serious. I had a tempeture of 101.7, so I decided to wait until the morning to go to the health center. In the middle of the night, I woke up and took it again and it was 103.1...ekk! I kept waking up...it was absolutely miserable. I HATE being sick.</p>
<p>I feel better now, I have medicine and all. I missed all my classes today...today being a Wednesday, that really BLOWS...I can't afford to get behind. Oh well...I don't think I could have handled it, so it's good I stayed in.</p>
<p>Monday was so very busy. I wrote my article for the Red and Black, but it won't be published this week. I need to find sources that are willing to identify themselves. I am hoping Sonya and Ilya would be willing to do it...if not, I'd be in a sticky spot....actually, I just called her alittle bit ago, and she and Ilya agreed.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will try and do what I had to do on Tuesday night. I'm feeling pretty good right now, I may end up in class tomorrow.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm being tested. I feel like I'm being punished too, but not because I did something wrong. I do feel very innocent. That's my most valuable asset. It's probably why I would never hook-up...I feel if I did that I would lose that innocense. I don't know when I want to lose that...I just want have fun and be happy. I want to get through this semester and make this investment and be happy. Anyways, like I said, I feel like I'm being tested. When I said punished, I think it's more of being surprised. Like a lesson. I shouldn't expect anything? Is that what I'm supposed to learn? I think I'm too trusting, but I feel losing that is in a way a lose of innocence...but if that's true, then I've already lost it...trust is gone. It's like a test. If I pass, I don't know what's going to happen. I have to struggle and suffer alone and come out stronger. I will pass, and I won't fail. This is the cue for me to wish that things were different, and yah, that would be nice. But things change, you grow away and heal and feel very differently. That's changing because it has to. I'm not looking over my shoulder as much as I did at first. The running has helped, I want to funnel my energies into that because it's therpuetic. My friends don't understand, but they try. I don't know. That's probably why I don't like to think about it.</p>
<p>Now it's time to sleep.</p>
<p>P.S.: In other good news, I seem to have gotten over my dry spell on downloading mp3's. That all came about when I lost them all when the laptop crashed. Now, I've been downloading some new stuff. I got some from Allyson's away message...Wilco to be exact. I downloaded some Buffy songs and am being very open minded. I'm attracted to the lyrically complex...so that's what I'm looking for. It's good to know I have music.

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, January 31st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Today so far has been good...but so very dull. I went to class...we talked about essays...I had breakfast...worked on spanish. Fishished it. I'm so bored! I'm sorta content that I am on the right track with my reading assignments, but I really don't care. I know I've got to get used to reading oodles of shit, but I fell either burned out or empty. There's no reason to do anything. I feel like I'm going through the motions. What's the point of it all? Am I jumping through all these hoops and doing all these tricks to please myself? I'm not very happy with any of it. Tonight, I'm going to two parties. The thought of that last semester would probably have been exciting, but I feel like I'm just making an appearance. I have to be in bed early tonight anyways, I have this leadership conference in the morning I have to wake up for. I can't even drink...apparently, it's bad for the antibiotics...not that I really could drink because of the conference. I like that phrase, "going through the motions." I think it means living without reason or purpose...just lying in wait. That's what I must be doing.</p>
<p>This weekend will be...dismal. Saturday, I'm going to a party...I may just drink for the hell of it, but it never makes me feel better, so I probably won't.</p>
<p>Thus concludes my mini-update. I must attend my Spanish class now followed by office time...sigh...</p>
<p>...OMG, this is officially one of the worst times of my entire life...so far of course. Fuck the whole Bryant thing, that's nothing anymore. I feel like screaming out or something. My parents are complete idiots! They are constantly doing this damn tug-of-war with me, I don't know what I'm supposed to do anymore. It seems that their childish bickering has destroyed our home, finally. My dad wants me to come back next weekend and help move everything out of the house. Yeah, I know, just the one fucking thing I want to hear at this moment. On top of all the shit I'm juggling this semester, I have to deal with the fact that I won't have a home. I have to live at my aunt's house (which is not bad, really, BUT MY HOME!) Why don't my parents understand that? Why do they play this fucking lame he said/she said over and over, expecting me to fish out what's right when I have NO fucking care for any of it. I just want to bury myself or hit myself with a blunt object over and over again until I forget what it's like to feel like this. Maybe I can just disappear off the face of the earth or something and end up somewhere better...at least where I don't have to worry about some of the shit they put me through. Oh, and my mother's answer..."You can always come up here for the summer..." Yah, like I'm just going to transplant myself...fuck this all...nobody understands me...nobody can fetch me from where I have been thrown.

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, February 1st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Don't listen to me, I got all moody after I talked to my dad...hopefully that situation will deal with itself...it's just a pain in the ass. I don't have much time, but I wanted to put something before someone read it and thought I was a complete mental case. I'm so funny sometimes, I had an AWESOME time last night, and honestly haven't felt this good in a while...I would say I soaked up some self-esteem. I'm hot, and people know that...haha. Ok, off I go...to forget about all of this!</p>
<p>...Ok, now that I'm back and I'm not needing to do alot of shit, I can elaborate on certain subjects. First of all, I was so incredibly saddened to hear that the Space Shuttle Columbia was destroyed on re-entry, killing its seven astronaut passengers. For some reason, this impeticular tragedy has really effected me. To know those men and women died in the pursuit of exploring space...I find that incredibly heroic. May God rest their souls.</p>
<p>Other then that, I am feeling oh so very nice, I had such a nice night last night. At first, I was going to come and go, having to wake up early in the morning...but then Nathan was all like, "You need to take a shot with me," so I decided to stay. After that, I was all wired and having fun. Oh, and I was around all the really cute guys, and that was so much fun...haven't been doing the whole scoping of guys in a while...and I totally should! I think I was being hit on too...quite obviously...but I was all shy and stuff, and he was very drunk...I'm going to have to deal with that later I guess. Maybe I'll go out on Wednesday or something...but I really wish I wasn't so shy...sigh...</p>
<p>Ok, I have to go now...a nice night ahead of hanging out with the close friends. Later.
