<p>Partied last night against my better judgement. Today I've got to finish the Parkes research paper, MOST DEF. At noon I'm all over that bitch... Tonight I may do the Queer as Folk, if they have one. I have no clue what I'll do for dinner. I've got no money. We'll see how long I refuse to spend what little non-existant money I have.</p>
<p>Last night was fun...I wish I could link to Stefanie's journal so you could read about it, but I am not sure she's into everyone reading it...I feel priveledged that I have access :-D I was cognisent, damnit! I am proud that I kissed everyone I kissed last night! I'm not sure where that puts my tally, but I've blown Missy AWAY!</p>
<p>Maybe I should be alittle less DRUNK at parties (though I really wasn't THAT drunk) and a little more forward with my feelings. No references will be made here...that wouldn't be a good idea. I don't care...I have other things to worry about for now. Until then.

<div class="post">
<p>In the interest of writing something down here while I still have something to say, I've decided to write an entry for the third time since I've been awake today. Basically, am now basking in this feeling of giddiness brought about by new and different forms of human interaction. This never lasts...and you know it's on my mind all the time because I refuse to refer to it definitivly, because definitions are bad! I prefer fumbling toward definition, one day realizing you've been defined. It's more fun that way, don't you agree?</p>
<p>What's funny about Blue Sky is looking around and realizing just how many people are gay. Take now for instance. There is a guy sitting to the left of me who is typing something on his computer. Gay-dar picked up NOTHING, maybe I wasn't looking, but anyways, he starts chatting with someone I know is gay, and suddenly he's plopped in the "queer" column. Some would say this tug-a-war over whether or not someone is gay or straight is bothersome, but in moments like this, I disagree. Sure, it would be nice to be attracted to someone and not have to worry about being decked when you tell him he's cute, but don't you think it's fun FINDING OUT someone is gay that you originally thought wasn't. It's like meeting a whole new person, all of a sudden! It's great!</p>
<p>What do you think of my title for this week's journal? "...Happy end." It's obvious that it's a continuation of last week's title, "Let's pretend...", did you get that? Any regular Nick stalker would know that's a line from "You Look So Fine." I like that, alone, "...Happy end." implies that the end of this semester is happy, that I somehow overcame every obstacle and am free from all of my shortcomings. It would be nice to be optimistic, but you have to realize that last week and this week are one, so really the title should be, "Let's pretend / Happy end." To what extent am I fooling myself? How far are these lies from the truth? What's the significance of "You Look So Fine?" So many questions...and they are just oh so much more valuable than answers. Answers are not happy endings.</p>
<p>The most rewarding thing for me this year regarding my webpage has been titling my journals. I feel like I have cemented each week forever in time--I feel like nothing sliped by me this year. Yah, some titles sucked. Whenever I used a song title as a title, that was indicative of the fact that nothing really interesting happened or I was just listening to that song too much...or maybe that the lyric I was tossing in my head regarding the week was too long itself to be a title. Some titles I thought really grappled what it was I was feeling: This week and last week's title, "Simple", "Black Penny", "Fever", "Separation", "The Nothing", and maybe the whole "Pessimism/Optimism" thing. That worked out nicely! Life's not episodic...but it almost seems that way.</p>
<p>This year, I've fallen in love with Blog. It's a form of communication for me. My friends read it and they know what it is I'm feeling--they have a heightened knowledge of whatever shit I happen to be bogged down with. It's not necessary to read, but it's the first place I'll go when I need to vent, and sometimes I say something interesting (i.e. last Wednesday's entry). I try to be artistic, sometimes I am successful. In "Optimism", I did that whole entry about the stars...that was fucked up. I thought I nailed "Sleep" more or less.</p>
<p>My point is, I like this. This isn't going anywhere. The nature in which I publish my entries has changed. I am no longer writings things about people I care about. Sure, I'll comment on maybe an argument, but it no longer takes on the form it did last semester. I was being a complete ass to Aiman, and I'm truly sorry about that. I don't think I really understood the power of this Blog. It wasn't until the episodes with John and Bryant that I really realized what it was I wanted to omit and what I wanted to hold onto. In John's case, DON'T write shit about the people you care so much about. It's best to keep your mouth shut. In Bryant's case, DON'T reveal who it is you're crushing, ESPECIALLY if they read your journal. It worked out for the best--he liked me too--but playing hard to get, let me tell you, is much more satisfying ;-)</p>
<p>Anyways, I feel like lumping on some extra pressures onto myself tomorrow, so I'm going to finish this Creative Writing stuff tomorrow. The majority of my Spring Semester ends tomorrow. I don't want to leave...</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Where the hell is "The Second Renaissance Part II" on the Animatrix site?? I've been waiting for that shit all month! Grumble grumble.</p>
<p>I've added "Blog" to my Poems page. You can link to it here if you'd like to see my stab at creative non-fiction. It's Blog inspired, so as a reader of MY Blog, you should be interested.</p>
<p>In other news, had a very interesting trip to Atlanta last night. I must admit, though, the orgy that ensued afterward was much more interesting. Kinda, yah, nice, I guess. Probably shouldn't focus on it too much...have that pesky paper due Wednesday at 5 p.m. Also, seems I have to clean the room tonight so my sister can take a good haul of my stuff tonight. Am definitely willing to part with Mr. Television. Mr. Tele has been a shit to me this semester, being a big slut w/ the roomie this semester. I swear, I don't even watch it nearly as much as I used to. I really only rely on it's weekly doses of Angel (I watch Buffy at Thom's). I'll probably watch more when I'm back in May-retta this summer, seeing as I will be very bored. Ick, boredom...such that ensues upon trips to the biblioteca, which to where I am now embarking. Tootles...</p>
<hr width="50%" color="#000099" align="center"><br>
<p>Am sitting here at Blue Sky and have just come to the realization that I am so tired, I have no desire to work. Because I feel this overwhelming ire for attempting to understand any written word, I've decided to venture back to Mary Lyndon to nap. I guess that's what happens when you only sleep about four hours...</p>
<p>So, before I go, the orgy. No, of course it wasn't a real orgy, though my penis was touched several times. The evening started with Barry suggesting yesterday afternoon that I come with him to Atlanta to bring back some of his stuff. I agreed and so did Matt, and Stefanie later that evening. The four of us packed up Barry's car and headed to the ATL. We had such entertaining conversation in the car. Missy is a blast, don't get me wrong, but when I probe the depths of sex that Barry, Matt, Stefanie and I probed last night, Missy just can't handle the weight of what is said. In her defense, she can stomach it, but she really doesn't prefer to have these conversations in public areas. At the diner we went to, Barry, Stefanie, and Matt just laughed.</p>
<p>We drove back, and on Stefanie's suggestion, we had a big sleep over in her bed at her apartment. This was really nice, we all talked and got REAL close. It is such a thrill to be touched by three different people all over your body and having no idea just WHO is touching WHAT. Sleep was really hard to come by. I think we went to bed sometime after 4 and I remember waking up to the sun around 8 and never going right back to bed. I felt awake afterwards, but now attempting to tackle this paper, I feel like I might die of fatigue. I can't go into more details about the evening...I just really liked it. Alot. Barry is so much fun, I look forward to having alot of fun with him this summer occasionally and next fall as well (also looking forward to having more sensual massages ;-) ). Stefanie is dead sexy...she kissed me! Surprised me...wasn't expecting that. And Matt...he's so cool it scares me.</p>
<p>Ok, enough of this. Sleep!

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, May 8th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Today is a special day. I won't say why.</p>
<p>Anyways, I didn't finish my honors option paper for journalism...but I'm finishing it right now! Yey! Hollander granted me an extension. He rocks. I just hope my efforts prove to be a good paper, and I really pray that he'll give me an A in the class, because if I don't get an A in that class (I'm not betting on an A in Spanish), my ass will be GRASS. I'm not quite sure how that will happen, but I will be very upset. This will be known as my worst semester, by FAR! I mean, I had better not get all B's. Ok, yah, so I got a B in creative writing, and that's been depressing the hell out of me everytime I think about it, but fuck it. I need out, whatever gets me out the door. I may not be a good creative writer...maybe that isn't me, but I enjoy it, and I plan on working on that so-called talent. WHATEVER.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm going to lunch with the sexy Genevieve and then I'm heading home with Rachel. This weekend, no parties :'( However, I will be job-hunting w/ April and also plan on talking to Target about coming back full time. If they are not condusive to me working at the LEAST 30 hours a week when I return, then I'm going to pursue a second job. I'm going to feel so much better having MONEY again. Getting rid of the credit card debt...that will be great! Also, in the next few weeks, I have big things planned. Missy and my Toga Luau will be on Wednesday next week, and then on the following Tuesday I'm having a Buffy Finale party at Stefanie's apartment in Athens. Hopefully I can get a good group together to watch that...even Michiru! I love Michiru :-)</p>
<p>Other than this, I'm going to go to Ohio w/ my cousin to see my mom. That's going to be great. That's just going to have to be her Mother's Day present because, well, I'M BROKE. I can't wait to see her, she's been so supportive of me in school...if it wasn't for her, I don't think I could have made it through this semester.</p>
<p>Sigh, I must finish this paper. After that, I'm going to start taking my dorm room down. Wow...my days in Mary Lyndon are over. It was an excellent room. Both roommates I had SUCKED. Choe stunk. Luke is an asshole. I swear, there is not one instance when Luke doesn't scowl. He hasn't slept in the room the past two nights, so maybe he's getting some...that should make him happier, you would think. Anyways, enough roommate backstabbing...I'm going to miss this place, but I need to go. I'll be back.</p>

<div class="post">
<p>It's over. I'm home now. It's sad, yes, but it's time for a change of pace, right?</p>
<p>I had a blast last night. I went out with Missy, John, Jeremy, and Matt. We went to Molly O'Shea's, but they wouldn't give me a t-shirt for my sister. We left quickly and went to the Annex. Blah blah, it wasn't that interesting, but the orgy on John's futon was, I think, the most interesting. Blah blah blah...</p>
<p>I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Maybe I'll write later, when I have something to say.</p>
