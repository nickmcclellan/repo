<p>My weekend at home, in retrospect, was very successful. The situation is very grim there, however...I won't be going back until Spring Break. I did my taxes and ended up with a whole lot of money. That's going to make things easier for me until this summer. My dad also gave me some money. I appreciated this especially. Anyways, I don't really want to talk about all this now. I'm going to NOT write for now. If you really want to know, CALL ME! Otherwise...later

<p>It must be real annoying to click on my journal and find the only thing I wrote in it is this really dumb entry about how I don't want to write anything. I noticed that I've got 21 hits for that stupid blurp. It's not that I haven't tried writing, it's just that everytime I get into it I realize how completely stupid the things I am writing are. I really don't want to write about bad things, and it seems that's all I have to say. You know, daily pressures: tests, asinine professors, growing ire for it all. It's not very cool flooding my website with these things. I hope you can understand that.</p>
<p>In other news, I suppose I can talk about our preparations for spring break. Missy and Sonya seem to be spearheading the hotel search. I can't seem to care, unfortunately, I've other things on my plate. This weekend I have to write a revision for the English essay I botched two weeks ago and also I must complete a take home midterm. I really lament the fact that this revision is going to interfere with my midterm, that's not how I'd like things to be. I'm hoping that the midterm won't be so bad. I don't know though...Trivedi has been a handful for other people, and so far he's been pretty light on us. God, I just need a break.</p>
<p>John's been out of town since last Wednesday, it sucks not having him around. I've taken it as an opportunity to become a little more proactive at the "Administrative Director" type duties he's got. I proposed at the Rainbow Squad meeting on Sunday that we finally put this office redecorating issue to rest and appoint some people to brainstorm ideas and do the damn thing. I think if I can keep the ball rolling on this, it would be good for the upcoming election. John's leave has also been kinda sad...it's nice having him around, I feel all unbalanced and such. He's like my best gay friend, without him I feel so on my own. Plus he's got a shitload of alcohol in his room and I am really pissed that I won't be able to partake in it for tonight.</p>
<p>No, seriously, I miss John for more then materialistic reasons. OMG, "Beautiful Stranger" the video has come on MTV2...flashback to high school...</p>
<p>This album came out between my Junior and Senior year. That was an interesting time. I had sorta accepted I was gay and there was nothing I could do about it. I certainly wasn't dating...just working a whole lot. I also ran a bunch at the gym I went to. I'd say the songs that bring me back to high school the most would be the following: "Home Now" and "New" by No Doubt, "Coming Home" by Peter Schilling, and "Coffee and TV" by Blur. I would listen to these songs on the way to school my Junior year. "New" and "Coming Home" bring to mind very distinct feelings, actually. I would be driving to McEachern my Sophomore year to play rehersal and sometimes these songs would come on. I was really into them at the time, for some reason. "New" especially. I only had my radio at the time. The coolest thing about that time was when we got an hour "dinner break." I had just got my licence so it was neat going to drive thrus and such. I remember we had a cast party once, and that was so exciting. I was driving to a social function...ah, I was overstimulated. I actually (shutter) developed a huge crush on this guy Nathan Wood that worked tech for the play. It never really came to anything, though he did start working at Kroger that summer. That's an interesting story I will NOT get into now.</p>
<p>Actually, those cute guys in All-American Rejects are on MTV2 now, so I think I'll watch that now...later...

<p>Excuse my drunken state, but marvel at what perfect grammar I am still able to perform. I called so many people tonight. I was so very excited and overstimulated. It was awesome. Rachel showed up, and that was probably the highlight. Lots of drama there, apparently, but I'll not get into that. It's just nice being around my Rachel on a Wednesday night. Also had various dancing fun. Must admit it was fun assaulting Charlie in a sexual manner on the dance floor...he's so much more fun to dance fuck then the Pad. OMG...</p>
<p>My eyes are tired...I look forward to sleeping for hours upon hours...tonight was fun, hopefully I can have the same sorts of fun on Friday and Saturday. It the midst of all this confusion, it's nice to just let it all go and dance under the stars for once. Explore the possibilities...sigh...if only I had alittle more gall.

<p>The weekend has stretched out before me and though there is alot to do, I sense that I also have alot to look forward to. Tonight I'm going to the Krush Girls. I would really like Missy to come with me, but I sense she is not going to. I've called Matt and will probably go with him. Gee, I hope this is cool to do...I really wish Missy could come. It would be fun to drink and be all merry together :-P</p>
<p>Despite my whole lack of appeal to write any journals this week, I think this is good. I started this entry with something that was not cool to be saying here, but then I decided to stop because I really dislike the whole drama-in-the-internet-journal thing. GOD that is so old. I don't like that word anymore. Internet Journal. From now on, it's my blog. I like blog. It's so much better then moody internet journal.</p>
<p>Sigh...in other news, bad news came this week. Buffy the Vampire Slayer will be ending after six and a half seasons. The finest show on television is coming to an end. I'm really not that upset about it. I think it's time. I'm going to have every episode on DVD one day and that makes me very happy. It was very special while it lasted. I hear the last five episodes are going to be AMAZING...and it's not like anyone's untouchable anymore...ANYONE CAN DIE! I would love to see Xander die...he's gotten very plump lately and really doesn't serve as interesting a purpose as he once did. More fat-manish than teen-boyish. Well, I'm bored...I'm going to lay down or something...I just can't get into this stuff this week.

<p>I have this thing inside of me. I can't get rid of it, it's like a horrible disfiguring disease. I haven't told anyone, but I have something very real inside of me. I have a little Missy Valentine inside of me that makes me boogie and jump everytime I hear some crazy 80's music. It's AMAZING!</p>
<p>I had tons of fun tonight. Sigh, where to start? I'm not starting anywhere. I just feel so cool going out and having fun, I really deserve to do that all. I have a fucking midterm and a paper to do tomorrow, that's going to blow! Tonight was just FUN. It was dancing crazy with so many people that I know. I fucking ran into people from high school! Jill, Deanna, and Deanna's sister Stephanie were at the 40 Watt. That was interesting...I think Deanna have me a dirty look though...I may have just been really drunk though. I also saw this girl ELIZABETH from my FRESHMAN ENGLISH CLASS...I will not forget this EVER. It's so awful that I forgot her name despite the fact that I see her all the time. Next time I see her sober, I shall apologize for all of that.</p>
<p>For some reason, my nipples are so cold they could fucking cut diamonds, wtf? After the 40 Watt, the freshman were all amped about walking back, but I was so into going to Little Italy and seeing my Missy and company. I went there and scored a ride back and got to honk at their drunk asses as they walked back to Hill...gee, I hope Rachel got back alright.</p>
<p>Matt was so cool tonight! He got me water and all and drove me to 40 Watt. He rocks. He left early to go hang with Eric. That's really cool...they are a very adorable couple...one could say cutest, but why? I mean, it's not like he can't PICK Eric off the ground like I can pick Missy off the ground! Actually, now that I mention it, I picked alot of people off the ground tonight. I picked up Rachel, Evan, and Matt, of course. That was all so easy and interesting. Sigh...so tired...</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I've got work. I've got fun...JOHN LYNCH! He rocks. I will definitely see him and chat. Well, I'm off to bed now. Probably should turn off Buffy and catch some Zzzz's. "Nyquil will help you get your Zzzzz's!" Yo yo yo...gonna catch me some sheep, hump em, make me some pillows, and sleep away on 'em. I rock yo!</p>
<p>...Well, it's tomorrow now, and I will give a brief update. Mostly to talk of the significance of the title for this week. I have been thinking very hard what I wanted to title this, it's really been a blah week. I really haven't been able to communicate meaningfully what it was about this week that, well, makes it count. I had alot of fun, I have alot to do...blah blah. I won't get into drama and all, that's not even cool anymore. I guess I was just driving back from John's listening to the Flaming Lips. I listened to "Do You Realize", of course...I flashed back to the winter break. It is a beautiful song...I pull into my parking spot, turn off the car and say one thing..."Asshole..." That was it. That's the only meaningful thing I can communicate this week, I guess it's worth something. One moment is better then nothing. Well, I'm off, later...
