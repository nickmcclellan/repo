<p>Things, ok. The car broke on Sunday night. Really bizarre, it decided to break down at the EXACT MOMENT I arrived back from work. Turns out that the alternator belt snapped on my way home. I'm really thankful, you have no idea. I recently lost my free roadside assistance from my insurance so having my car die halfway home from work would have been a real bummer for me. Thank the Lord I made it back safely and found getting my car fixed was fairly painless.</p>
<p>Having been feeling odd lately about my place in the big scheme of things. Honestly, I think I'm not doing enough. I feel like I need to do something good soon--something good for the soul. I think I need that...

<p>Have found a title. "Adventures in Table Serving." You all probably don't even care. Assuming I don't pass out before I finish this, I haven't even uploaded Tuesday's entry.</p>
<p>I had a great day Tuesday. Went out with Matt to Atlanta and other random places--finally saw <i>Finding Nemo</i>. It was alright. I had been really exhausted all week, Tuesday included, since I have been waking up early every morning dealing with shit, most of which being my car. Got my sleep last night. Hopefully I'll get some more tonight...</p>
<p>Anyways, Tuesday's significance would be many things. Kinda shot me off into tangents of thinking on exhausted Wednesday. To be or not to be... Tuesday was also my big show off to Matt (and apology sort of) that I finally had money and could demonstrate to him just how much I enjoy taking him out. I'm not cheap...pretty sure he knows that now. Things are not bad between he and I. Things are peachy keen :-)</p>
<p>Patience. If patience is a virtue, then I am a virtuous man. I've learned that my patience has kept me sane thoughout this whole trek. Some shitty tips tonight. Some good ones. I've been going all gung ho on this job, you have no idea. Some people that may claim to know me really have no idea the type of person I am. Work Nick is a very different person. Patient. Nice. Hard working. Maybe that's like regular Nick? Too many Nicks. All of them are tired, so they are going to sleep now...</p>
<p>Tomorrow night will be fun. Am going to Nicole's to mix cocktails. Remember Nicole? That sexy beast...haven't seen her in 10 months. Have been writing her the whole time she's been off in France. One of the most rewarding experiences of my live, writing to a friend. No just e-mails, physical letters. It's more real, it means more. Try it out.</p>

<p>Yah, gotta tie this up with some actual adventures in table serving, so here goes. Wednesday I had a double. For some reason, Wednesday night I had nightmares about serving tables...it was horrible! Thursday I did a late shift. Lates are supposed to leave around 1 a.m., THE LATEST, I ended up leaving at 2:30. A bunch of Austell cops came in and drank a hella long time. I served them till we closed. I made close to $100, so it was worth it. I was just really tired...now that I think about it, maybe I had the nightmares then...</p>
<p>Last night was tough. Jason was giving me a hard time. Kinda bummed me out, but I am feeling loads better now. Jason has been giving me a hard time all day today too, so I'm just decided on the status of the bug up his ASS. That ASS.</p>
<p>Wow, had a GREAT time last night at Nicole's. Haven't seen that sexy beast in 10 months. Got to talk to this girl Bethani that I talked to online months ago, but never really did click with (thought it would be wierd meeting a random friend of Nicole's) but she turned out to be very cool! Told me some VERY interesting things. Yah, about mutual friends. Didn't really mean much, more of a self esteem boost. Not really...well, some people are just cute...</p>
<p>We had spirits! I took a flaming shot of Golden Grain! Got Nicole very drunk. Freaked her out by coming on to her. It was great! In other women news, I think this girl Elena at work likes me. Kinda chickened out telling her I was gay, but I think I have effectivly communicated I'm not interested (not to say I wouldn't mind being her friend). I have alot of friends, people, I'm a friend you need to have!</p>
<p>I'm exhausted now. Had a long ass day. I'm off now until Thursday. I'm going to Athens Monday with Rachel. I'll be helping her back into her place. I'm helping with the orientations and other random Lambda crap (no, not crap...it's good crap...like underwater crab crap, the kind that sparkles!) I'll also be chillin with Matthew, the significant other. I found the key today, I was rolling silverware when I was doing it (proff that I DID my silverware!) I'll love seeing him, fo sho...</p>
<p>EXCITEMENT! Come on people, it's time for fun! Break from work...cool peeps (going out Wednesday) AND I hear Missy's making out with James alot lately. Bad girl. I miss my friends...but I'm cool, people, I'm COOL
