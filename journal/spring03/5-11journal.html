<p>I saw X2 tonight with my dad. I liked it alot. I think it's VERY OBVIOUS that Phoenix will have some role in the next movie. Did you notice the ORANGE GLOW in the lake at the end?? I THOUGHT SO!</p>
<p>(Bad joke on SNL about Elton John, SNL is just BORING) Anyways, I'm bored as hell here in Marietta. I applied to Taco Mac today, would be nice for a change of pace job-wise. I may go see Target this week about coming back to work, but I suspect they won't be generous with hours.</p>
<p>I had a nice drive home from Athens with Rachel. I was very tired though. My homecoming has been uneventful, I really wonder what form this journal will take now that I won't see my good friends. ...today I got a hankering to finally do my comic for the site. Maybe that will come soon!</p>
<p>Sorry...feeling distracted, thought I had a good entry planned, but alas, I have not followed through. I think I'll go to bed. Call me though! I'm bored...

<p>My week has been pretty nice so far. Being home has above all things been BORING, but Matt called me on Monday night and invited me over to Stefanie's apartment to watch <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> with him, Barry, and Stef (of course). Her apartment is in ATHENS, so I had to consider what that would entail. I don't have much money...AT ALL, and I needed gas. I decided to go, it turned out to be alot of fun. Yesterday, we got Stef a little surprise...hopefully she's enjoyed it. We all slept together AGAIN (remember LAST WEEK??) and I didn't get much sleep AGAIN (2 HOURS!!)</p>
<p>I got home and went out with April and did these tests at Outback. Hopefully I'll get a job...anyways, I opted to hike before the sun set and after that, I was absolutely exhausted! I watched Buffy...what did you all think of it? I think it's predictable...at least for what the finale will hold. I'm intrigued with Dawn's behavior. Obviously, her mother's warning earlier in the season that Buffy would be against her was heeded. Hopefully Dawn will do something useful or get decapitated...that would be nice :-) Anyways, I digress...</p>
<p>After some minimal chatting online and some pasta I made, I basically passed out on my bed and went to bed. I don't think I've been that exhausted for a long time.</p>
<p>Probably shouldn't get too much into this here, but I'm sorta dating someone now...I won't say who, mostly because it would be viewed as DRAMA by SOME people, and it sorta is. I've told many people about it, I think I may reveal later on...fo sho ;-)</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm off...later. (The women of Blind Date are so disgusting...30 year-old women trying to be twenty-two...it's just UNNATURAL)

<p>Toga Luau was awesome!!! One of the best parties I've ever been to, fo sho! I guess since it's summer and everyone was very scattered (and it was on a Thursday) not alot of people were able to show up. I must admit, that was a downfall, but the people that did show up were very cool. Alot of my closest friends came and they all had a really good time. Missy and I were awesome hosts! I made "Dog Food" (this stuff w/ Chex, peanut butter, chocolate, and powdered sugar), and Missy made brownies. EVERYONE got leied ;-) Our friend the Keg never arrived (I think his name was Kasey). He had some excuse, Gen said she thought it was bullshit...perhaps. I stand by my observation that Missy's denying Kasey the fabled 2 hour blowjob MUST have been why he didn't deliver on his keg promise.</p>
<p>Clean up was pretty easy. Not sure how Missy's gonna explain to her dad where all that beer went. I got a bottle and a half of Golden Grain that we didn't consume, so I guess that can be my summer supply. Honestly, I don't drink much during the summer anyways, so maybe I'll let them collect dust in my closet.</p>
<p>Today, something amazing COULD have happened. It may still happen, I would anticipate in the next few weeks--maybe even next week, I will be ridding myself of the nightmare that is and always has been the Shit-mobile. My sister is trying to get a new car for herself, and my dad is going to give me my sister's car and trade the evil vehicle of death in. We couldn't do it today--it's good that we wait. Family issues. Oh well, one day, VERY SOON, I will be free.</p>
<p>Ok, just a sidenote, I'm watching a Road Rules marathon on MTV, and this person Shane on the most recent Road Rules...he is just odd, I mean, when I saw it the first time he seemed interesting, but he reminds me of people that I've met this semester, and just seeing how he reacts to being gay, I can see him being very selfish and spoiled. Maybe that's just cheap to point out, but he seems like the type of self-involved waste of person that will forever be living his life in an attempt to live up to the expectations of others--forever perpetuating useless stereotypes, reinforcing his role as a useless waste of space. (It's fun using celebrities to talk about people...you'd never guess WHO)</p>
<p>I'm tired, I probably won't get this uploaded tonight (my dad seems to want to hog the internet tonight :-/ ) I'm off to bed...not sure what tomorrow will bring, hope it's SOMETHING...
