<div class="post">
<p>Thought I'd do something before I went to bed. It seems so quiet tonight, and I'm not tired. I put up a new desktop on my computer. It's just the lyric from "Sleep"; "Now all I wanna do is sleep..." I like that song. It's so simple and to the point, I guess.</p>
<p>Someone has IMed me...I think I know who it is, but he's being all strange. Maybe I should have drank tonight, I would have gotten to be all strange too, or something, you know. It's better that I didn't though. Dancing at Bones was fun. So very odd, the mood I must have been in. What's the word? Oh, yeah, "going through the motions...", maybe that's still me. Maybe I'm just bored. Burnt out or something. Not sure how I could deal with that.</p>
<p>I like that idea though, "all I wanna do is sleep..." It's so true. Falling asleep is the most peaceful thing to do. I like just rolling over and closing my eyes and just letting my thoughts tumble away like foam swept about on some lonely beach. I could just get lost in that all. When I was young, my "dream" was that one day I could weather the chaos and make it to my subconcious. That I would somehow know that I was sleeping and that my mind was capable of anything now. I could fly, I could travel the world, I could romp around for days and days in my subconcious existance, away from all law and reason. I was never able to make it out though. Just swept away into chaos, got all caught up and forgot what I was looking for. That's why I want to sleep forever. No one will find me. No one can hurt me. I will just surround myself with thoughts and lies and sleep...in my living death. And I'll be so dead, I won't care anymore. Just couldn't need to.</p>
<p>But I'll wake up tomorrow. I'll be standing concious with things to do. Things to deal with. I won't sleep forever, but maybe in some moment I will. I'll close my eyes and I'll be away from it all, right? That's how it will work tonight. You won't see me anymore, I'm just going to drift away and you won't find me. But I'll be back where I started, waiting. Waiting for a reason to come back to life.</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I'm going to be a punk and just say one thing. I figured out who I want to fall in love with and spend the rest of my life with...well, in theory. It came to me while I was doing my hair. I would love to date someone like Nicole Levesque. She's so awesome. We always have so much fun together. We make fun of eachother when we go hiking, and do all sorts of fun adventurous things. I find myself so at ease with her. We could get in huge fights and stuff and then make made passionate make-up sex. I could show her all my favorite movies and intelectualize them, and she would totally go over my head on that too...because she so adorably smart and sophisticated. Well, if anyone out there is Nicole Levesque and you look devilishly handsome and have a penis, you'll just have to let me know...</p>
<p>...that would be nice. I probably should write her another letter. She's written 3 and I've only done 2. I should settle the score, plus, I'm expecting, hopefully, that she will be responding to my letter I sent a few weeks ago. That would give her 4 and me 2, and I have got to beat her!</p>
<p>Sigh...the storm subsides, for now. Notice I was a slight morbid on Sunday...or late Saturday. I mean, it's appealing though. I could fall asleep and all my worries would just drift away forever. That won't happen. I'm not stupid, it's just some of the things I am expected to do, I don't know if I can do them. I have never done this much before. I mean, I am running on trust here. I trust that there is something inside of me that's going to get me through it. Tomorrow, I will finish <I>Wings of the Dove</i> and schedule some sort of thing with Parkes to discuss what I should write my paper on. That's the plan. God, I hope I do the Buffy thing too. I heard it is supposed to be a fun episode. We shall see.</p>
<p>I have something to look forward to! GOD, it's not Valentine's Day, hell no. Well, I mean...I don't see it being all that special. Anyways, I digress. Wednesday is "Boogie Night." Missy and I (AS PLANNED, though plans seem to fall through SOMETIMES) are going to go see <I>Boogie Nights</i> at Tate 9. After we have seen this movie about an especially beautiful penis, we will continue our "boogie" night by going to the local club that exhibits an assortment of penises. That would be Boneshakers, retro night. We will continue to boogie, possibly enjoying penises, though that's doubtful. But you never know :-p I can't wait for our "Boogie Night!"</p>
<p>As for now, I will enjoy my Monday night break. We'll see what's inside soon. "Defeated / He realizes that misery's a right of passage / As he slams the door to his room..."

<div class="post">
<p>Today was a good day! For the first time in my life, I have been published. My article on Fake IDs appeared in the Red and Black today. That was great! I actually did it. So very tickled for my accomplishment. I did it all by myself.</p>
<p>You can read the article by <a href="http://www.redandblack.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2003/02/11/3e490734c9fde" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. Let me know what you think! I know it sucks, but I know I can do better. I am thinking of doing a feature on Athens coffee houses. I am interested in going around and seeing what's out there.</p>
<p>I don't have much to say...other then this. I think Chevelle's video for "Red" is cool...the guys are so hot and angry...yummy! Also, I am not sure I mentioned this other thin in my away message...but I know it's so superficial and stupid, but I like the All-American Rejects song "Swing, Swing." Sure, it's mind-numbingly simple and they are just a bunch of adorable guys wrapped in Rock and Roll costumes...but I just find myself listening to it. Also, does anyone else thing 50 Cent is just fucking DONE?! I mean, you've seen one, you seen them all. Oh! This one has big muscles and knows Eminem! Who gives a shit...

<div class="post">
<p>"Boogie Night" was somewhat a success. Missy didn't come along. That was the whole point! She did come to the movie at least. The movie, I thought, was anti-climactic. I mean...we saw the penis...and it's just a big penis. That's all it is. He really didn't have anything besides a penis, and that's just sad. I mean, it has to be more then physcial presense...you have to have it in your heart and your head. You have to spread worth around you like butter. It's unfortunate that some people have one thing with which they function. It's always interesting to see when it's all stripped away how that person reacts. Moral: Get a life.</p>
<p>Boneshakers was actually sorta fun. I was so afraid when I got there that I wouldn't see anyone I know, but I saw Charlie, and he was in a dancing mood, and that's so good of him. I danced around alot. Ran into some of the freshman. Everyone was all into action between Nate and Shawn. Only on a Wednesday night... Well, I saw Daniel Tindol, that was cool. He has been missed, he had a nice haircut and he seemed very well. I suppose a life away from Lambda has been good for him. Who needs all that drama anyways? Damn straight.</p>
<p>Was bored afterward so I attempted watching a movie with Jeff. We were both very tired, so he was nice enough to let me sleep on this strange couch-cushion thing in his room. So very cool NOT coming home for a change. I would certainly like to do that more often.</p>
<p>Tomorrow night, EVERYONE must come to the Valentines thing at Memorial for Lambda. Come and see me and be nice to me because it's Valentines day and I don't have ANYONE to be my Valentine (though Anthony has agreed to be my e-Valentine, so I guess that's something). Well, come have fun with us. I'm off to finish this day...hopefully it shall end productive. Later gators.</p>
<p>...One last thing. My cousin called me tonight. Seems like my family is not the only one falling to pieces. The world just seems so dead lately. Things are so gloomy and bad. School sucks. Life sucks. It's not getting better. I realize this, and yet I drive home screaming out "Head over Heals," loving every minute of this existance. If there are 2 things that I have that I would say are the most valuable, they would be the following: my sanity and my resiliance. I'm not insane, which is good. I mean, that's always good. And as far as anything goes, I'm not falling, I'm not going anywhere. It's going to take more then a steamroller to get rid of me. No, seriously, I'd probably just run around it. Well, I'm not going anywhere, and desite things going straight to hell, I'm sitting patiently in my seat. :-)

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, February 14th...HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I GOT INTO GRADY COLLEGE! I'm officially a Newspapers major. This is great news (but I already knew I was so smart to get newspapers, but whatever). On the subject of Valentines, my 3 sexy mama jama's are Missy, Gen, and Sonya, who all got roses today. My pimp daddy is John, who got ME a rose. What's up with that!? I got a rose on Valentine's. That's something. Ok, I'm off to start the evening. If I don't come back with best couple, heads will roll >:-o
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, February 15th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I DIDN'T win best couple...but that's ok...that's ok...I can't help it if the dance was run by HETEROPHOBIC PRETENTIOUS BUTTHOLES...oh, that's too harsh. I mean, maybe a few insolents were PRETENTIOUS...and maybe a few were BUTTHOLES...but certainly ALL were HETEROPHOBIC. They just didn't know how to handle me and Missy's sweet French Vanilla flava...oh yah!</p>
<p>No, seriously now, I am OK with this, I suppose. I do take solace in the fact that most people couldn't take their eye off us the whole time, seeing that we were the only ones who actually DRESSED UP for the theme of the dance. We did it so well too. I got several comments, including one from Jeff who said I was very sexy :-) Chuck didn't even recognize me. It was alot of fun. Every 80's song we got up and danced to. I took a shot of Bacardi before I came (chased it with water...big mistake). I was feeling the buzz initially, but that sorta wore off as the night progressed. After the best couple disappointment, I went back to Mary Lyndon with Missy so she could change her shoes. I ended up talking to Dayanna about some romantic woes, and gave her an interesting perspective on being on the "dumped" side of the relationship. I mean, it's not like I had as "rich" an experience as she had in mind, but I think I helped her. I mean, if you are dumped, at some point you have to move on from that whole predicament. You sorta play with the idea that, yea, MAYBE he'll call me up someday and tell me how he finally can make it work and that he's ready to be with me serious this time...but after a while, you let go of that. You can't just pick that up out of the blue, either. God, once you let go, that's it. You've had enough, it just hurts to think about it any further. Despite that, I hope that things work out for Dayanna. She's very cool and deserves to be with the guy she loves.</p>
<p>Well, we ended up at Boneshakers after that. Jeff, John, and Jeremy all left RIGHT when we got there...I know, I was like, "WTF!" We danced around and entered ANOTHER Valentine's constest. We lost this one too, despite the fact that, ONCE AGAIN, we were the only people the seriously dressed up (except for Kenny, who did wear a kilt...I don't know what THAT has to do with Valentine's, but it won). Missy and I drowned our sorrows with dancing and we got Sonya and Ilya involved as well. I got to talk to Matt and Eric, which was very cool. Matt is of course a wonderful guy, but I never really had a conversation with Eric. They are a very cute couple (oh, yah, and they did win best couple at the dance...so I GUESS it was sorta accurate, but I MUST point out that Matt ORGANIZED the dance...and it's so not kosher that he should win the couple prize...those love cuffs should be mine!). Well, we finally parted ways with Boneshakers, at which point I became moody. Talked to John for a bit while I took the drunk children to Wal-Mart. Missy and I were going to stay at Sonya's, but figured a night in our own beds would probably be best. Did that instead...so I went to sleep.</p>
<p>To put some closure on this week, I'm awake. I'm awake now, and God-willing, I'll be awake tomorrow too. The answer is not in your dreams. They're only the beginning. They're the genesis of a wonderous arc from bed to bed in which life occurs. Dreams are separated by daring flights, flights in which we face the challenges of life. Whether they be papers, boys, or pretentious pricks, we face them. We win. We lose. Life goes on. But we always have sleep. We always have that immesuarable spance of subconcious time in which our dreams hold us and set us off into the world again. I'll always have that. I don't want to sleep forever. I just want to get over this by living. I want to be there when it's all over. I want to have the chance to start again, stronger. I want to have the opportunity to rise from my bed and take my flight and conquer those challenges. I'll have that chance.</p>
<p>As for today, I'm going to work on my paper and do a movie night SOMEWHERE. You should call me, you know, if you wanna. ESPECIALLY if you have a good movie suggestion. Until next week...goodnight.
