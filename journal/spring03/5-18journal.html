<p>Ah, my week of lazy NOTHINGNESS has paid off! Would you believe me if I told you today marks the end of an era? No, actually, I'm not dumping the shit-mobile (at least now) but it seems I have finally found a replacement for the BITCH that has been summer employment. Today, I just walked into Taco Mac and walked out with a job. Now I have two jobs! HOW ABOUT THAT! I love it, my confidence is up, fo sho! Thursday I'm filling out a bunch of tax info and next Tuesday I'll probably start my 20 hours of training. It's exciting! My new manager Ben basically told me I could have all the hours I want and I let him know about the 2 or 3 weeks this summer I'll be doing the orientations. Today was a good day! I was too much of a chicken shit to drive to Target to give them the bad news. Maybe Wednesday?</p>
<p>In other news, I'll be going to Ohio this weekend with Jen and Laura (my cousin). We had a reunion last night and decided that we'd drive up, stop somewhere and "camp", and then we'd make it to Ohio and see my mom. I'll probably be there until Tuesday (hopefully Monday). It will be a hell of alot better then this sit-around-the-house, wait-for-something-interesting routine I've been knee deep in since I got back from Athens...</p>
<p>The party was FUN, the excusion to Athens ROCKED, the morning after AMAZING, but everything between all this has sucked. Sure, dishing about STD's with my sister and my cousin was GREAT, but I want to have more fun! I'm not dying to get back to Athens, seriously, I like it here, I feel like this summer I could do alot for my self-confidence (and my pocketbook. I've stopped balancing my checkbook, it's too depressing). When I get some money, then I can drive again. Nicole will be home soon, we can hike and stuff. I'm really wanting to take out this PERSON I'm dating...like, one of the first things I'd like to do w/ my money, sigh, like, money is necessary, you have no idea...how can I drive anywhere without it? Whatever...soon...they'll all see...</p>
<p>Did you see <a href="../../sherry/index.html" target="_blank">this</a>? Why don't you look at that cherry icon on the main page NOW! You'll find it's finally been finished! Obviously I was bored...hopefully Episode Two will be alittle more interesting. WHATEVER, I'm out of here, later peoples</p>

<p>My week has ROCKED! Money woes got lighter as my aunt helped me out mundo for paying me handsomly for some moving I did over at her house on Wednesday (I was sorta "hung over" of a sleeping sort though, but I don't REGRET that one bit). The biggest highlight of my week was my Buffy Finale bash in Athens on Tuesday! Wow!!!</p>
<p>Tons of people showed up, there were lots of snacks. We played the Buffy board game for about 15 minutes and then chatted. I put a condom balloon outside of Stef's apartment so people would know where we were at. The episode started and everyone was polite and silent during the good parts. People laughed at Buffy's cookie analogy on why she's not ready to settle down and get eaten ;-p The finale ROCKED!!! Buffy empowered a whole new generation of women (I saw it coming). Anya died in the most disturbing way possible...I wanted to cry, it still bugs me out now...I loved that woman, I think she's my favorite Scooby...tell it like it is sister! Afterwards, we talked and got rowdy. Someone downstairs had to knock on the door to quiet us down. It rocked...I stayed up all night (for different more pressing reasons) :-)</p>
<p>I wanted to write briefly on why I named my journal last week "Pause." It just seemed that last week I was fulfilling what I had done my entire semester--just dwindle my life away, becoming a wasted shell of a person...ok, that's alittle grim, but yah, I needed a break. Despite my pause, I was still able to slip into a job. I was able to fumble around and survive into the next week. I was surprised, there really isn't much to do without money. I'm going to have tons soon, so watch out. Got that money making bug, yo, and my pockets will be bursting from the seems!</p>
<p>God, I'm so tired...I don't dig journals as much when I'm at home...yah, WHATEVER. Sorry, I'm not at my best, maybe I will be later, so yah, um, yah, show's over folks...later peeps...</p>

<p>Ah, a break. Sure, I BROKE all day, but why not take a break on a Friday night? OMG, only in Marietta would I be this bored. In my defense, I would be so much better off if I had some MONEY. Sure, I got alittle this week, but that's got places to go. Cell phones don't pay for themselves, sadly.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm going to see <i>Matrix Reloaded</i> w/ John and his dad. Fun. Tonight, I watched Powerpuff Girls on Cerworn Nattook (do you get it??). My sister offered to get me a pizza, she's been really awesome. She's got a heart of gold if not a keen intellect. I really want to make alot of money and get over alot of these grim days we've been having. Oh, and I bet I'll get out of this stinkin' house. Missy wants to go to Stone Mountain w/ Gen on Sunday. Sounds like fun.</p>

<p>Hello chicks. Nick here. Are you ready for another exciting entry? Let's see if we can't nail this one. No interruptions, no regrets. Here we go.</p>
<p>Day begins. I wake up, earlier than usual. You would think that since I went to bed at 2 a.m. I would wake up very later. I set my alarm for 10 a.m. and started to wake up around 8 a.m. Very odd. I was surprised that I found the energy to make it to Target this morning to talk about my impending departure. Turns out that I'm scheduled this next week and the week after. I'm thinking that I won't be able to make these shifts...what are they going to do, FIRE ME? Well, I may try to make Tuesday's shift, we'll see, but I'm really not into going back to that place, it's not even pleasant anymore. Uck.</p>
<p>Next up, <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i> w/ John. I liked it, I don't care what Ain't It Cool News said about it. I thought it left alot for the audience to consider. There was alot about control: what is it and to what extent is our apparent control of our society an illusion. <i>Reloaded</i> really sent the trilogy into a very different place than <i>Matrix</i> established. Honestly, I think the creepiest thing about the <i>Matrix</i> is the machines, and though I didn't get much of the vicious machines, I believe that <i>Relvolutions</i> will deliver for me. We'll certainly see. After <i>Reloaded</i>, I left John and returned home.</p>
<p>My sister and Ashley (Taco Mac friend) soon swept me up and I was off again to--of all places--Taco Mac! We had lunch, my sister got it for me, I don't have any money :-( I got 50% off though, cause, GO FIGURE, I work there now! Cool man. After Mac, we went home again and my sister agreed to pay for my ticket to see <i>Bruce Almighty</i> with her and my cousin and my aunt. We did that, it was alright. Had fun in the car on the way over to the theater with condoms (I don't think my cousin and Sarah were really amused). Whatever, like I care. It sucks to be PRUDE. This movie wasn't as good as <i>Reloaded</i>, but we can't expect everything. Seems like SOMEBODY tried to make a knock off of <i>Liar Liar</i> (I'm sure that was intentional).</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm at home again now. Will call person I'm dating at 11:30, most def. Maybe it's not so bad if I mention who that person is, but I don't think it's necessary yet. Laura (sexy sorority girl, the SEXIEST actually) IMed me and ASKED who I was dating (avid Blog reader) and I told her. See, it's not so hard. I guess SOMEONE reads this, huh.</p>
<p>(Insert similar word to Anyways), I better go. I just wanted to get an entry in before midnight because then I wouldn't be able to, it being the Week of May 25th and all. In 50 minutes, I will have been a high school graduate for two years. Coincidently, it will also be 4 years since I was so brutally upset when they postponed the broadcast of Graduation Day Part 2 on Buffy (because of violence in schools, uck). I know the wierdest stuff, huh? Congrats recent grads!</p>
<p>Can you believe it? A whole new bunch of freshmen! A whole new crew of pretentious, narcissistic, selfish, self-involved pricks. Can you believe it?! Lambda's got alot of those, where are we going to put them all? God, I can go so many places with this, I'll just STOP.</p>
<p>Goodnight!</p>
<p>TREAT!!! Look at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/squishedpixie/formal.html" target="_blank">this</a>. Is that not the coolest thing YOU'VE missed?? Most random fun thing EVER.
