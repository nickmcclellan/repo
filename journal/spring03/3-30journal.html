<p>Oh, crazy night last night. I feel like sleeping all day, but I can't, I have a paper to write. I won't get much done for my Trivedi paper...actually, nothing at all. This week the focus shifts to that.</p>
<p>Last night was a hardcore drinking night. It was actually a meaningless and really regret-free night. I did get sick, but unlike the other two time I got sick, there wasn't this feeling in the morning that I had made this huge mess. The first time, well, there was a huge mess because I had vomitted all over myself and my room. The second time I had really pissed off the group of people I was hanging out with (not that messy, just very rude). Last night, though, I didn't hit on anyone that I wouldn't have wanted to hit on. I was smart enough to stay awake so I would know if I was going to vomit. I think I probably shouldn't have run down the streets of Athens screaming, "Missy gives the best head ever! I should know because I'm not a homosexual!" I am not sure how that sat with my friends, but I talked to Missy this morning, and everything seemed cool. Needless to say, Missy did pull a "Missy Valentine" last night, sorta. I guess anytime you get penis delivered to your dorm room that's considered pulling a "Missy Valentine."</p>
<p>Other then that, it was nothing special. Nothing at all, and today I feel fine. I need to head to Blue Sky and continue to write and revise my paper. Gotta get an A! Tonight, I'm taking Vicki to potluck to introduce her to Padmini. After that, the QAF party. That should be INTERESTING...then sleep, sweet sleep. Not drunken room spinning sleep :-(

<p>I wanted to write something last night about how good it was having Vicki come to potluck with me. It was my intention to introduce Vicki to some of my other friends that she would find interesting (other then random gay people I know). I know I was successful at this, Vicki really did enjoy herself. This whole past weekend has been really good for me. What I have to say about it is that I seemed to have got everything I wanted. For a while now I have been asking Missy to join me at Blue Sky sometime and she always says, "Maybe," and then says no later. I finally told her I just didn't believe her and that she should just be honest about what she'd like to do. I think it finally got to her on Saturday. She actually made it to Blue Sky with me and found that it was a pleasant change of atmosphere. I knew she would! Also this weekend, I worked on my paper and I think I did a great job. I hope Parkes shares my opinion. All in all, a very good weekend.</p>
<p>A note of Saturday night...I was insane crazy! Apparently I stepped on feet among other things, but I think it was fun despite my crazy drunkeness. I really didn't care, I'm just glad I didn't do anything I'd regret.</p>
<p>Well, not much else to say...this is a rather lame entry, apologies. Adios all.

<div class="post">
<p>Not much to report April Fools wise. I have honestly dropped the ball on that the last couple years. It all apexed with...well, I won't say. I may want to use it next year...</p>
<p>I'm officially now Administrative Director-Elect for Lambda! My role in the organization is going to trastically change, and I'm very excited about that. I feel like next fall I'm going to have so much to offer the organization. I think my number one goal is to work very closely with the board to assure that all of our objectives are met. I'm really psyched that Marilia got elected, she's very personable and she's someone I think that can help Lambda evolve away from the "cliques" that disease it. I feel like next year we're going to have a board that's going to make a real impact. I look forward to working closely with Eric, Marilia, Stefanie, Aiman, and Milo, assuring that Lambda makes some powerful new strides in the coming years. What this organization needs is new blood, and I'm full of it! Come and get me!</p>
<p>Other then that, the clock is ticking down to April 16th, the day I will surely pass or fail. I have two weeks to prepare Trivedi's paper. I need to finish reading the material this weekend and focus next week on securing all necessary secondary material. The thorn in my ass is the Lambda retreat this weekend, but I will work around it I suppose. I'll probably spend my Saturday night in the library, but it's NECESSARY! I will survive.</p>
<p>I want to go home and sleep now. I hate Wednesday. I will go to class, I will do my laundry, watch Angel, and shake my Bones...later all.

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, April 2nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Let the mudslinging begin! "You wanna go Glenda? Let's go!"</p>
<p>I suppose that's not the mature thing to do. I mean, it would be rather disgusting to kick someone after they have kicked you in the gut, but really, I'm over it, I'm over the mortal coil. I could really give a shit anymore, I really didn't care then, honestly. I have my friends. I had my friends before and after. I am proud of everything I did. I don't care WHOSE toes were smashed, because honestly, maybe I felt like they deserved it. And you know what? Mean people suck. Mean people really suck and it's going to get them in the end. They watch their friends dwindle away one by one, not realizing it is their own short-sighted IDIOCY that does and not who they think it is. I can't help it if some people are just BI-POLAR and don't understand. I'm sure she will though, one day. Maybe, someday.</p>
<p>Mean people suck. I could put something else here that my FRIEND Jeremy suggested, but I won't. I'm over it, like I said, I'm over this mortal coil. Because one things for sure. Baby, you suck.

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, April 3rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Regarding my obvious words to Sonya and Ilya, that's it, well, this included, that's all. I have nothing to say to them. I don't really care what they write about me in whatever journal they've got because, like I said, I'm over it, I was over it weeks ago, before any toes were smashed, before any egos were bruised. Honestly, I have better friends. I really like Sonya and I really like Ilya, I wish I could still be their friends, but both of them together have just been pissing in the well that they drink, pissing just about everyone off, and I'm going to let them go down the path they've chosen because that's obviously what they want. I never see them much anyways, and when I do, they're not even that interesting. The subject of Sonya and Ilya will thus never be mentioned again.</p>
<p>In lighter news, I turned in a revision to my pitiful short story "The Garfield Monologue." I've been working on the revision since Spring Break and, while I'm not posting it on my website, I think it deals with many complex themes...blah blah, whatever. Lately, I've enjoyed writing alot more then some of the stuff I have been doing. Up for next Thursday, I need to have a creative non-fiction piece ready. I think I'm going to do excerpts from my Blog over the last year, tying in alot of the themes I was juggling with at the time. This evening, I think I'll be working principaly on that while I'm at my regular Thursday visit to Blue Sky.</p>
<p>I love these visits to Blue Sky. There is something about Thursday nights now that does not seem complete if I'm not away from this horrible room. I like sitting in Blue Sky, my laptop enqueued with several of my favorite songs, and me sitting there working on something for class. There is something incredibly pleasant about the atmosphere there. I feel so free, and oddly, so alone--like I were the only person there. I can get this feeling anywhere, but Blue Sky, it just seems to fit. I don't need to run into anyone either, though it is nice. It would be nice to see The Pad tonight, but I can always go by her place sometime tonight. The Pad seeing will occur whether she likes it or not!</p>
<p>And I suppose I'll close this discussing the disturbing away message Matt has been putting up. Don't let his lies mislead you! I'm actually not having his baby. I'm sorry, I don't have those kinds of organs. It's a damn shame. A damn shame...oh well, off I go. Listening to "I Drove all Night" by Celine Dion...very depressing...very sad...</p>
<p>BTW, I picked a title this week! It's from the Flagpole's favorite band names at SXSW. I don't know, but "I Love You But I've Chosen Darkness" just struck me.

<p>An update: The retreat, so far, I believe, has been very nice. I like where we're going with this. In other news, tomorrow morning I'm running the Show of Feet with Gen. It's a 5K, it's the first road race I've ever done. I'm excited about it. It's going to build me up for the Peachtree this summer which I have aspirations to tackle. Bring it on! I'll be sporting my Show of Feet t-shirt while running in the next few months. Honk at me, congradulate me on my valient early-morning effort. Ok, all I wanna do is sleep now, so that's what I'm going to do...
