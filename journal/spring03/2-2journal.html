<div class="post">
<p>Ah, the day is over and I will soon be all wrapped up in my nice comfy bed dreaming about...wouldn't you like to know. Figured I'd put something here since it was fairly successful. My Spanish class seemed enamored (this week's buzz word) with my Spanish presentation. Hopefully the teacher will be as well. Got out of Trivedi's class early so I got to get dinner at a reasonable time. Ended up going to Snelling with Jeremy. We've decided to "get some guys into Missy," in as many ways as such a statement would suggest. Went to the Lambda meeting...it was interesting, I suppose. Things always get better for me after Spanish on Mondays. Things are better for me in general this week.</p>
<p>Saturday, there will be another gay party...I will be in attendence with Missy as well. We'll have to get there early for some choice liquor...hehe. I am so into this immature college stuff...it's keeping me sane.</p>
<p>Wish I could be more interesting...but the bed is just oh so tempting now. I will say one thing...my roommate really pissed me off last night when I asked him to turn down the TV so I could sleep. He said, "I can't hear it over your fan." And I was like (to myself, unfortunatly), "Oh, I'm SO sorry that you can't hear your precious <I>Shallow Hal</i> at 12 in the morning on a Sunday night. I guess my sleeping for my 8am class is just not as important." I mean, it's my TV, if I want him to turn if OFF when I go to sleep, that shouldn't be a problem. I should get more backbone and tell that bitch off, huh? Anyways, he keeps asking me to turn down my music...so that will just have to be my revenge. Haha...two can play this game! Ok, off to bed...later people.

<div class="post">
<p>Today was very productive, I suppose. I love Tuesdays. So stress free. I feel like I wish I could just throw myself on my bed and sleep for days...but I can't, I have another bitch day tomorrow, and I don't have a fever to save me this time. Anyways, today...</p>
<p>I woke up and went to my writing lab. That's just nothing, I was actually looking forward to when we were aloud onto the computers so I could get online and harass Missy or someone...I can't wait for the day I get AIM on my cell phone, that will just be awful. Well, then I went to lunch with this guy Jeff who I'm supposed to go to a movie with on Friday. He seems very nice, and it was a nice opportunity to get to know him in a non-drunk environment. Merilia sat with us too...that's this girl that I met last semester who is definitely one of the coolest people I met last semester. After lunch, I was supposed to read, but I got so bored I fell asleep for a while. I wish I could sleep in or something, I need a mid-week break or something. Maybe I'll nap every Tuesday afternoon...well, I woke up at 4 and went running. I ran like a champ today! I ran the normal 4 mile loop and didn't even stop until I got over by that Athen's copy place. Last Saturday, I ran with Missy and had a fairly successful run as well, but I only made it to just before Maggie Moo's. Well, I also ran down Broad all the way to the light on Lumpkin by O-house...it felt great. I was reading just now, and I could feel that warm feeling of physical empowerment...ahhhh, it was great. I think the next opportunity I'll have to run will be Thursday or Friday...or both.</p>
<p>Buffy was alright tonight. Reading spoilers has sorta spoiled my enduring passion for the show, I think. I knew what was all going to happen, it's just not exciting. Either that, or this season has sorta staled ever since "The First" started its attack on Buffy and Co. I really hate the idea of all those potential Slayers...too many people! I liked the show when it was about just the Scooby Gang and such, I wish it would shift focus back to that group. As of now, I'm not really looking forward to any specific episode. I hope they are saving alot of the juicy stuff for the end of the season. I want to see how this ends. My favorite season remains season 5. I would REALLY be vamped about seeing an episode in which Glory from Season 5 returned...I loved Glory! She was so beautiful (she had nice boobs too) and she kicked Buffy's ass. Well, enough about all this...</p>
<p>Futurama's on, I'll watch that and probably go to bed...hopefully read some more. We'll see. Until next time...

<p>Ah...this actually feels good and not forced. I have time to kill before dinner and studying, so writing here actually makes sense. I'm not writing out of necessity...but out of like actual desire. Well, I had fun last night. I officially feel alot better about everything. Didn't last that long, did it? I've felt good since Friday, really, which was my low, but then it's like, why the hell am I feeling all bad? I just had to shift a few things around, and things are fine now. The semester is going to be hell, academically, but social wise, I shall be just peachy.</p>
<p>Last night, I went out with John, Justin, Jeremy, and Matt to Boneshakers. I wasn't able to go last week since I was sick, and this time I got to be all social as opposed to when I went on Saturday (I went on Saturday, if I didn't mention it before, which I think I didn't)...Saturday, there was oh so many creepy people there, nobody I knew, so it was just a dancing aerobic thing for me and Missy. Last night, I got to see all my friends and I actually got to have good guy fun :-) I danced with Jeff, the guy I'm supposed to go out with tomorrow. That was fun :-) I also got hit on this guy Steven, I think, I don't know, someone I didn't know so I'm all not wanting to talk that much to the person...always get freaked out they just want to hook up or something. I was drunk, so I was sorta curious. Well...other then all that, I had a great time. I got tired, fell asleep...I wish the Vodka energy lasted longer, but what can you do?</p>
<p>I finished the poem for my creative writing class today...actually, I've been finished with it, I just haven't been all into working on it. I said I'd put it on my website, but I really don't know...I've been writing so much anyways, I'm not putting all that up...I may put it up sometime, maybe if the class really likes it. Otherwise, there really is no reason. It looks good though.</p>
<p>Ok...that's all for now. Later.

<p>Little note...couldn't think of anything really interesting to name this week's journal. I was going to go with "Warming Experience" from "So Like a Rose"...but the lyric is actually "lonely experience"...and that's too morbid. I choose the sticky hands thing from "Hammering in my Head" because I've been listening to it occasionally, and that lyric just rocks...
