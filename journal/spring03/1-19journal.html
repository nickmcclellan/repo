<p>Here I am. I'm still here, and right now I feel alright. Not thinking about much. Star Trek is on. I was telling someone that everytime I'm watching TV and that show comes on...I feel this sort of facination. It's a childhood interest that's laid long dormant inside. I imagine that I will watch anothing episode from my Buffy DVD soon. I need to take the DVD Missy and I watched on Friday back sometime. Another late charge. I don't care.</p>
<p>Last night was kinda sad. My sister came into town and I had no where to take her. We went and saw <I>Just Married</i> (not my choice) and it was NOT the best movie to see. This whole ordeal has uncovered for me what it was I really wanted from someone like Bryant. It's so incredibly pathetic, but it's not. I'm not going to go into it or anything, I'm through putting useless revelations here. I just don't know how I'm supposed to endure with all that I know now about myself.</p>
<p>I finally broke down and listened to "Cup of Coffee" (even though I know every song by heart anyways). Before, it was like, "Yeah, that's the depressing song on Beautifulgarbage." Now, it's like I can feel it almost. Pathetic, right? It's like the words have more significance to me. Alot of feelings do, but it's not like I haven't felt this way before. I think I did, back in high school over that whole Tim thing. Then it was so new, it was like a rite of passage. I didn't think I'd have to feel that way again. Being back in this situation, it's almost comforting. I took on an amazing transformation then, I wonder what this will reveal for me. I'm not in a rush to find out or anything, just a bit anxious to feel better. I just want to have something to look forward to, something to conquer. Something to do.

<h2 class="date-header">Monday, January 20th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>In the midst of reading 600 pages in 5 hours, I decided that an appropriate distraction would be to write my good friend Nicole. I did this and the distain of reading more was an excellent motivation for writing a lengthy letter to my friend in France. I will send it tomorrow.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm going to be able to finish this book I'm reading. I will have to read the next book from front to back and write whatever paper we have to write on it. It wouldn't be the first time I didn't read a book I was supposed to. I really don't think I'm going to get to 600 pages...this book is really boring. I could give a shit who this girl marries...everyone thinks she's so interesting, I find the only thing that is supposed to make me interested in her is because everyone else is. I'm not falling into that. Well, anyways, I've decided to take a break. I think I'll shower and run at the track. I hope it's not as cold as yesterday.</p>
<p>Regarding the "big news"...I find myself fumbling around everywhere to find some way to numb the situation. I actually, for the first time, this last Friday, I used alcohol to feel better. I think I've done this before though...but not conciously. I sought it out Friday. It didn't work, I didn't think it would. I'll just have to numb it some other way.</p>
<p>To all those that know about my whole light/dark dichotomy, I'm officially on the dark side. This can be bad...but I'm going to try to funnel all this dark energy into something useful...maybe my feelings of inadequacy can motivate me to change. Maybe I won't be so lazy about some things. I usually bounce back in some positive way, I want that to happen. I will try. Every day has been different. This feeling will go away.</p>
<p>Today was not that bad. It was actually a bit normal. I am very proud of what I did today. I ran down Lumpkin Street to Five Points. From there, I ran all the way up Milledge to Broad. From here, I ran to Finley and ran up that cobblestone hill to the Tree that owns itself. Some sight, right? Then I ran down to Russell and made my way through campus back to the Myers Quad. I'm not sure how far this is, but I feel like I don't want to run in circles anymore. I tried the track, and that just got really boring. There is something about going somewhere. It was like I was hiking but I was hiking in some suburban place...well, I kinda was. My goal is to run all the way to Leena's townhouse. That's down on Timothy Rd. off of Macon Hwy. I know I can do it.</p>
<p>After running, I went swimming with John. These activities left me with this warm feeling all over...a feeling of accomplishment. Missy suggested to me that this is what I should funnel all this energy toward; improving myself. I feel that's only natural. It's what happened last time. Physical transformation does not yield metamorphasis, however. I wish this could be a good habit. I could take it to Europe and run to so many interesting places. At least it takes me places.</p>
<p>I'm writing a poem for my creative writing class. I did alittle on Saturday and some more today. This would be the first poem I've gone back and reworked, most of my poems I just flop out and there it is. It's final form for me is adequate. This one is different. I want it to be special, I want to reader to hear everything I have to say. It basically focuses on distinct images and situations. It flip-flops between good and bad situations...hopefully this will confuse and confound. I like the line, "My heart lept when we touched / Our palms sliding / My fingers drag..." I'm going to keep it. I need to come up with something just as likeable for the dark side of the poem. I'll pick that up later this week.</p>
<p>Of course, I'll put the poem on my site when I'm done. That won't be for a while though. I'm going to meddle with this one. Like I said, every day is different. Every day must speak. Well, I think I'll work on something now...like school work. That will probably be best.

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, January 21st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>My adventures in running continue. Today, I did a loop around Lumpkin to East Campus and then back through Carlton Street to Mary Lyndon. It's really neat being stuck out there. It's not like Ramsey where I'm so close to my car I can just drive off in a half-assed ecstacy...I actually have to get back home, and running usually gets me there faster. Wednesday is usually very busy for me, so I'm not sure I will have a chance to run...I may do it, why the hell not.</p>
<p>Tonight is Buffy night. I plan on going over to Thom's, which is a constant joy of mine, especially last semester. I suppose he will be one to talk to...I always talk to him about my problems...I hope he doesn't resent that. I'm sure he doesn't.</p>
<p>I don't have anything to say...anything that's interesting at least, so you probably should just X out of this place, come back in a week or so, see if things have picked up. I'm really just using this now as a distraction from studying...but, seriously! I'm through with all that, I'm going to study now. Well, off I go.</p>
<p>You think you know, but you have no idea. Can't you see he's falling apart? The walls are broken, all around him. He's left with pieces. You brush your hand across his face and say it, and they fall. How can he do it without your help? He has to. He wants you to help him, if you can. Only you can. But you can't. Only if you have to. You're losing him. He'll build his fort and he'll be lost forever. You'll lose him, and he'll be gone. He won't come back for you. Catch him while you can.</p>

<p>Faced with a decision. I could mope around my dorm room and possibly study (I should study). I could go out to Boneshakers...I kinda want to go. I remember late last semester before I met Bryant I decided that in the Spring I would make more of an effort to socialize with guys...you know...in the fun ways :-) I decided that I could go on Wednesdays and dance and dance and have fun...and if something should happen, that would be fun. I should do that tonight. It will make me feel better, get my mind of lingering. I want to move on. I also need to interview a bouncer for my Red and Black article. I really need to get my ass moving on that. I figure I will do that tomorrow. Yea. Tomorrow.</p>
<p>Decided. I'm going. I want to have fun. I don't want to lay around here and be miserable. At least it won't be like last week when I THOUGHT he might not feel the same way...tonight I know, and I won't torture myself with it. I already know...I'm separated from what was making me feel so awful.</p>
<p>Even though I'm separated, it still sucks. When I go to sleep, that's the worst. I think about it...over and over...what I must have done...what I had no control over. Reliving each moment over and over again...different every time. Always the same conclusion. I said I wasn't invested...but I was. I got invested while I was stuck at home...in that miserable situation. He was the only thing that I had to hold on for. So much promise...the future looked so bright. I couldn't see anything else. A flash of light. That's all it was. Now I'm rubbing my eyes, disoriented. I will find my light. Somewhere. Not tonight...but this will be a good distraction.</p>
<p>...I decided to stay in...I'm tired, it's been a long day...sleepy time! yey.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, January 23rd...Happy Birthday Sonya!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Thursday. It will be a while before I forget exactly what that means for me. I'm sure you wonder, "Why is Nick's website named Thursday?" I mean, why don't I just name it "Nick's Website?" Do you even notice when you come to my page what's the first word that you see. It's "Thursday." Have you ever taken the time to read my poem "Thursday?" If you had, you would have noticed that there is no where in the poem that mentions the significance of "Thursday." So, why? What is it that Thursday does for me? Have you read my little explanation after my weekly blurp on the front page? It's bullshit. I only explained it once...last semester, in my journal "Falling into Place", I explained it all. My greatest revelation. Honestly, I still don't know what Thursday means to me. It's not like every Thursday I look to God and ask, "What's next?" It's just a day. I didn't even realize what I was doing last week when I talked to Bryant...I didn't give it a second thought that it was Thursday and it could turn out really bad...it wasn't important. Today was nothing. Nothing special or significant. It was just...Thursday.</p>
<p>I feel very isolated and alone. My whole mood this last week has probably contributed to this. Obviously, my friends are reacting. I don't know if anyone understands. Nobody understands me. I don't understand me. I can honestly say I did not love Bryant...I hope that wasn't infered at any point during all of this, but no, I didn't love him. So what's the big deal? I was just dating him..."Get over it!" You still don't know. It wasn't more then that, yes...but it effected me. It's absense has effected me. Every day, that familiarity, that connection I had to him dies. It's the best way to go about this. Every day the absense of HIM grows. The hopelessness grows. It's not about Bryant. I think it's about almost having something I could depend on. I know April and Matt had something to do with it. Now, it's like...I have to accept that I will be alone for a while. There is nothing out there that I want. Nothing that is going to make me happy. I can't find one thing to look forward to. I think it would be awesome to succeed this semester. I can see myself feeling incredibly empowered at the conclusion. If I can finish this semester with all A's (my AMBITIOUS goal), I will be so content. But what can I do for that now? Nothing. Eventually, a paper will be due...I'll work on it then...but that's a while from now.</p>
<p>But where's the motivation? I mean, last semester it seemed like every weekend I had something I could do. This semester, that all has fallen apart. For example, I'm going to Sonya's birthday party on Saturday...but Friday? I don't know! I'm too afraid to ask anyone because I feel like I would be imposing. Missy is going to Atlanta with Sonya and Ilya...I feel like I'm being pushed out of that. Why? I don't know...I can only assume it's because of my attitude lately. My miserable outlook...my unwillingness to feed into their uninfectious optimism. Nobody understands me and nobody cares to try. I don't know what to do either, people. How can I find my way if I'm covered in darkness...I don't know what to do. I want to find my way. Bear with me. I'm in it for the long hall, don't get me wrong. Please don't forget about me. It's just hard. I don't know what's wrong with me.</p>
<p>For now, I'm going to go to Blue Sky and work. Maybe if I accomplish something it will lead to some bright spot. I'll sleep well knowing that I have done everything I needed to do. I won't have to worry about anything. Blah blah, whatever. Call me if you care.

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, January 25th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I apologize for being so down. I know the last entry was sorta morbid. Things worked out just fine. Missy called me and I ended up at Sonya's dinner. That was nice and it was an uplifting experience. I talked to this girl about Oxford.</p>
<p>Last night, I planned with Gen to do something "off-the-wall." I came up with mixing drinks (My sister got me some Bacardi last weekend...and I kinda wanted to get drunk). I went running with Gen and got back to Mary Lyndon and had a good chat with Missy. I was sucessful at lassoing her to come along with me and Gen. We went to this Mexican place...it was good. I need to stop spending money. We went back to Gen's, got some mixing stuff, and mixed some Pina Coladas. It was nice...no one wanted to go to Boneshakers so I got back to Mary Lyndon and went to sleep. I had dreams I saw crabs (real big sea craps) in the toilet and no one believed me.</p>
<p>I had this sorta epiphany last night. I could let this funk consume me and ruin whatever semester I have left (which is quite a bit, thankfully). Or I could get over it. I am dwelling...dwelling for no reason. I think it's that I thought my happiness was through Bryant. Nothing long term, I'm not psycho commitment or anything...it was just that I saw a sort of peace with the whole thing. It's been rough having that taken away...finding it another way. My whole realization came when I realized that what I'm feeling is normal. Not only is it normal, it will get better, and ultimatly, I will be over it. I think last night was an example of me flirting with getting over it. It would be nice. I've resolved that I won't let this whole thing consume my week like it did this week. Starting Sunday, I'm going to work to put it behind me.</p>
<p>I have many reasons to move on. For one, I don't think I can handle this semester being so down and depressed, pining over some month long crap-shoot. I need my happiness. I'm missing that. The only thing I can see before me is challenges. I have no reason to meet them. I need my happiness...a bright and shiny outcome, a goal. Something to shoot for. It doesn't have to be someone, necessarily. I think I'm over that...at least in the long term sense. Everyone seems so boring and insepid. I am not attracted to anyone.</p>
<p>Do you want to know why it's been so hard to get over this? This thing impeticular? I think it's because for the first time, I was dating someone that I felt something for. Someone I could have felt something alot more for. I have never mentioned this, except maybe to my closest friends, because at the time I thought it was a problem I had. I thought I was incapable of it, for some reason. Aiman was such a great guy. He really had that for me, and as much as I tried, I couldn't find it for him. I felt that as time went one, there was this little black voice inside of me, growing larger and larger, taking away any affection I had for Aiman, replacing it with nothing. I had beat that...not only that, I had this opposite light inside of me, growing, replacing alot of my insecurities and personal dilemmas with this incredible attachment to someone...and "getting over" that means to kill that. It's so hard to kill what I thought I could never find. It's like picking up that needle in the haystack, smiling, and tossing it back. It's hard! Nobody understands me. I've noticed that my friends have all left the wake and are anxious to move onto other things. I need to do that too. Smile, I had my fun. I learned my lesson. It's time to welcome a new day.</p>
<p>There is no reason to linger. None that I can see.
