<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, January 5th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>It’s 6:06AM and I’m wide awake. Silly side effect from all those overnights...seems I wake up at the strangest hours. I slept most of the afternoon yesterday and I woke up around noon. I think I headed to bed finally around 3AM...maybe 2. I’m waking up around 5:45...when will this be over? Well, this is somewhat of a good thing. I do have an 8 o’clock class this semester...</p>
<p>So it begins again. So why was I so lame to title this week’s entry "Return to UGA Part 2"? I figure there are a lot of reasons. I see last semester as a battle won and lost. There are things I set out to do that I captured victoriously. There are others that I failed miserable to maintain. I think Spring Semester is an opportunity to learn from those mistakes and move on. To move on to the next level. I feel like this semester is a sequel to last. It’s like, "Last time at UGA" blah blah blah! "And now the conclusion." At least that’s what it says on Star Trek. On Buffy, Giles says, "Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer..." Buffy has the best cliffhangers...</p>
<p>The best "cliffhanger" was definitely when Buffy had to kill Angel to save the world. That was so long ago, and it’s no longer my favorite season finale. It was just a shock, sorta, I should have seen it coming. Whistler keeps telling her, "What are you prepared to lose?" Buffy doesn’t realize, but the audience should know that she’s going to have to kill her b/f. Well, I think it was predictable, but how they did it was great. Angel has her in a corner, ready to kill her at last. She comes back, swinging her blade wildly, and gets Angelus at the feet of Acathla to kill him and seal to portal that seeks to suck the world into hell. At this wonderful moment, Buffy prepares the final blow, Angelus defeated...and THEN he gets his soul back. Instead of Buffy having to kill Angelus, the cold-blooded murderous vampire, she has to kill Angel, her restored boy-friend, still unaware of what he’s done. She kisses him and tells him, “Close your eyes...” and she kills him. Like that. I watched it and I thought it was so beautiful. It was predictable, but the way she did it, it just fit. So where do I stand? </p>
<p>What was my cliffhanger? When the curtains rise, how do I deal? This semester is fraught with many challenges. I’m taking on 15 hours for the first time since last Spring. I had to drop a class then, that sucked. I don’t want to do that this semester. The situation with my parents has serious potential to affect me in the worst ways. I should probably make a bigger investment in my future. I was planning on attended church this semester and maybe making an effort to be confirmed by the Catholic Church…but that’s just funny…I don’t see myself doing that. I don’t have a real Catholic influence in my life. It’s hard to just pick that up. Also, that investment includes spending less of my time with Lambda and more of it with activities to stimulate interest in my major. I could seek employment at the Red and Black. I’d really love to do that. I also have to make a serious effort to attend UGA at Oxford in the fall. I think that’s the first priority. And there are other things... </p>
<p>I think I’ll leave it at that for now. I plan on arriving in Athens around 2pm. I’ll probably unpack, deal with the possible roommate situation, and seek Missy. I really want to see her! After that, I don’t know. I’ll probably see Bryant, I sure hope. I just need out of here...there’s something more in Athens. Oh, on a lighter note, the arrival of January also denotes the arrival of Conversation Hearts. Understandably, this has been on my mind. I would appreciate any reports of Conversation Heart sightings to be reported to me immediately...maybe I’ll share! But maybe I won’t...

<p>I know my journal from Sunday sucked...I apologize. It was early in the morning and I was just really out of it. Today has been really excellent! I hung out with Gen and I had dinner with John. Last night was nice too. After our reunion, which was very nice, Missy and I spent an hour at Ramsey. We then went out to dinner with Sonya and Ilya. That was alot of fun, I haven't seen Sonya or Ilya in a while.</p>
<p>One of the strangest things about being back is noticing the little things that make this Athens. For some odd reason, garbage seems to be one of them. I listen to garbage when I'm at home and all...but I sorta listed to Yoshimi more though. Also, yesterday, I stumbled upon a brand new garbage song, "I Just Want To Have Something To Do." It's a Ramones cover. It is excellent! It reminds me of "Enough is Never Enough", and since I will be burning new garbage CDs soon, I'll have to put it on one of them. Well, I also saw "Stupid Girl" on MTV2 yesterday, so it's like all of the nice things in life reappear when I'm in Athens. Word came from home today...things are getting ugly. I got out just in time. Thank God. Well, that's all for now (except that I got a roommate...but I will get into that more once there is more to say) Adios!</p>

<div class="post">
<p>My neck hurts. It just started hurting just now, it's not anything big, but it's something I feel like noteing.</p>
<p>Today was the first day of classes. I went to my two regular English classes. I figured out that it's going to be really difficult. Maybe not difficult, but it's going to be alot of work. I guess I was just focused on other things, there are so many other things that are so much more exciting than school now. I don't want to get into all that, but I guess I don't have much choice. Surely some good is going to come along to help me through it.</p>
<p>I went out with Vicki the other morning for breakfast, and we had a nice talk. She mentioned to me that I didn't have to make my journal impersonal. I guess I wasn't making it completely impersonal, just not so revealy. People draw way too many conclusions. It's not that I'm afraid of what other people think, it's that I just get so sick of that whole cycle. I just do what I've naturally done since I started this stupid thing, I publish what I wrote. Later on, I feel suddenly guilty about it because someone mentions it and turns it all around. Maybe it's not as fun as it used to be...whatever, I'll try "cautiously personal" for now.</p>
<p>I've felt very "good" lately. Things have been a vast improvement from the break. Also, whatever good stuff from last semester seems to have stuck around. But...as I do, I'm just SENSING something. I want to think I'm just paranoid, and I optimistically hope that's the case, but I just sense that things could potentially fall to pieces. Nothing big you know, things could change. I feel like I don't want to get to emotionally invested because I'm just going to end up hurting myself. I just feel so subjugated though, unlike I've ever felt before. That's a good thing, right? I feel fine, it's just...I want to be careful. I think that in the last few days, there hasn't been that much to analyze, so maybe that's why I'm so paranoid. Whatever, I hope I get over it. That would be so atypical though. I'm rarely paranoid for foolish reasons.</p>
<p>In other Nick news, I went and did kareoke at Boneshakers on Tuesday night and sang "Special." I don't think I did a very good job though...but at least I did it sober! I'm so brave. Bryant and Whit were brave too (in a drunk way though) and sang "Run" by George Straight. They did a very good job, people should not have walked out of the room! Needless to say, Bryant was adorable on stage. Some guy was hitting on him that night, which was really odd for me because I didn't really know what I should do about it...I trust him, but we're really just dating, so I didn't take issue. Bryant wasn't interested...which is good...cause then I couldn't date him and be sad. Gen came along too and had fun. Missy had been MIA until last night, she finally got back to da A-town. We had a little 3 Musketeers reunion (seems like that's going to stay just the three of us). I'm actually going to watch ER with Gen tonight as usual. Can't wait for that...I suppose. I don't want to go to class...I just want to have fun, give me four months of fun and then we'll talk.</p>
<p>I'm tired of writing now, so I'm out...hopefully I'll write some more soon!

<div class="post">
<p>I guess this is my pedastool, huh? Did I even spell that right? Since I lost my Dreamweaver and I figured out Word fucks with my webpage, I am reduced to this Notepad application once more. Well, here I go.</p>
<p>Today has been boring. Aside from beating Super Mario Sunshine, I worked on some homework for one of my English classes. I was supposed to go to the library for an hour and find as many bibliographies about the Crimean War as I possibly could. I gave it a good effort, I stayed for fourty-five minutes. I got a good haul. Afterward I went to John's to work on some Rainbow Squad stuff. I've got to get the office up and running with volunteers. That shouldn't be too hard. I did it last semester, and things ran very smoothly. Right now, I'm trying to work out my schedule problem. It's really one of the few things that has put me in this strange funk. I really don't have alot of pride for school right now. It's almost as if I'm going to classes I may have to drop, so why should I get invested in anything? I can't buy books for them...I can't begin to tackle the material, not until I've figured out this schedule. I should have it solved by Monday, I hope. The sooner the better.</p>
<p>My mood has somewhat improved. I would say it comes and goes. Alot of things are up in the air, and I feel very much out of control of anything. That bothers me, I hate sitting around and waiting for things to happen. I want to take charge and move on. I'll just have to wait.</p>
<p>Something that's come up recently. I read part of a book my friend Thom let me borrow. It's called <I>Boundaries: Where YOU End and I Begin</i>. It's a very excellent book. Basically, the most valuable lesson I learned from it is that you don't have to accept what anyone says about you. That's right, whatever anyone thinks or feels about you is shit to what you think. That is an example of another person's boundaries infringing on your own. They have no right to hold stock in your personal matters. Sure, people have opinions, but when they take the next step and share those opinions with you, they are doing you a grave misservice. They are not trying to help you, they are trying to manipulate and hurt you, lash out at you. It is irrelevant what is said and whether it is true or not, if what is mentioned needs to be addressed that is up to you and you alone. NO ONE has a right to say anything they want about you. If they ever do, it is appropriate to tell them to please stop and not to mention it again. If you don't respect your own boundaries, then no one else will. Please don't forget this, it is very important. It is one of the most valuable lessons I picked up in the last year.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I'm going to do tonight. I may stay in to prove a point, I don't need to do anything with anyone...but while that's true, I don't have anything to do here...so it really encourages me to do something. Actually, I have a good bit of reading I can do, so if worse comes to worse, then I'll read. I'm ok about that. I'm not going to let my feelings about things interfer with my mood anymore. I'll be just fine. Well, I think I will work on other website related business...until next time!</p>
<p>I've returned to write a few things. John told me something really wonderful tonight. He said I was his best friend. That's so amazing, and he is my best friend too...but he isn't. I know, sounds bad, right? He IS my best friend, but he's not. Missy is my best friend. But as far as John's concerned, I am his best friend, and I AM the BEST friend to him any chance I get. I am devoted to John (in a BEST FRIEND way), and even though he's not my best friend, that doesn't make him any less of a friend. John is awesome, and I still gawk at him, amazed at the person before me.</p>
<p>We talked about love, and I asked him if he's ever been in love. More importantly, I told him I had never been in love, but I have. Not romantic love, but I have so much love for so many people. I love Missy, Gen, Sonya, Vicki, April, Nicole, Dina, John, Rachel, Padmini, and the list goes on. I know I must have forgotten someone so important, I will be shocked later, but this is just a mini-list. As far as these people are concerned, I am in love.
