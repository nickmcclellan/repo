<span class="solid">Welcome to my Blog Archive.  This is where all the old school HTML Blogs have been stored.  They are ordered earliest Blog to latest (though the earliest Blog was written during the Fall of 2001, the internet version of the journal did not appear until the summer of 2004).  Please enjoy the stroll down memory lane.<br>
<br>
Blog is a place I frequently go to write about random stuff, some of it interesting, some of it vaguely familiar to my friends, but none of it deeply personal.  What I write here I intend to be honest about and in no way is ever intended to be kept from anyone.  Sometimes I do make suggestions about topics that lead readers to make their own assumptions about them, but I'm asking you not to do this.  My Blog is a place where people can read my musings about the week and see how it has affected my sanity.  If you think I'm trying to say something specific with my Blog, ask me about it and don't make assumptions.  I really hate this single aspect about Blogging, assumptions.  They make an ASS out of U and ME.  You can e-mail me at <a href="mailto:yoshi369@yahoo.com">yoshi369@yahoo.com</a> or IM me at <a href="aim:goim?screenname=basuraboi3&amp;message=What's+up+with+your+Blog+man?!">basuraboi3</a> if you have any comments.  Thanks, and enjoy my BLOG!</span>

I met some of the most amazing people with whom I'm still friends with. And most importantly, I created this website.
