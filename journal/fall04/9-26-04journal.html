<p><img border="0" src="kikyosofticon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I'm waiting for my movie to start.  It starts in less then an hour.  We're watching <i>Looking for Richard</i> today.  It has Al Pacino in it, and I think it sounds really boring.  I don't want to go, I want to get blown up into this hurricane and leave this place behind.  Well, maybe not that literal, but I'd certainly like to be elsewhere.  With someone else even.</p>
<p>I must apologize.  Ever since last Thursday, I've been involved in a sort of personal crisis that under no circumstances I will delve into here.  It's far too personal and none of <i>anyone's</i> business, that I've only recently begun to be honest to my closest friends about it.  I just want to acknowledge here that something has been going on, and I'm sorry if I seem detached or even cold.  I'm not ignoring you.  I just don't have the strength to deal with all of this stuff all at once.  Sometimes, the thing that happens is the one thing that you want most is the one thing that is just beyond your reach.  No matter how hard you stretch to get it, you can't nudge it out of place.  I'm still nudging, so pardon my reach.  I am looking forward to making amends.</p>
<p>Other things have happened, though.  Blogable things, so don't fret.  This weekend, I did real good on Trilegiant sales, and though I feel I've sold my soul to Satan, at least I'm going to be very well paid for it.  I made about 25 sales on Sunday alone, and maybe 10-20 Wednesday and about 20 Saturday.  With that many sales, I'll almost certainly make a hefty incentive, meaning that next Wednesday's check is going to make me very happy.</p>
<p>On the free iPod front, my mother was the last screw in my brilliant attempt to swindle Apple out of an iPod.  I am awaiting her order to pop up as completed (she actually picked an offer she wanted instead of the instant Blockbuster offer).  That's going to happen as late as Friday, so I probably won't be able to order my iPod until then.  Once I order it, though, it takes as little as 3 days to get here.  I hear, though, that alot of people are completing offers like me and Gratis Internet is in a sort of iPod queue...but they are assuring everyone they can keep up with demand.  I suppose we'll see.  If I find myself without an iPod, well, I guess I can piss and moan about it.  Well, if you want to expedite my iPod progress so I can get 5 offers before Friday AND you can start your own quest for 5 offers, click <a href="http://www.freeiPods.com/default.aspx?referer=8718185" target="_blank">here</a>.  I won't feel bad if you don't, though.  Like I said, any day now.</p>
<p>On the academic front this week, I have things I need to do and things I should do.  I need to make some headway on my public affairs article.  I should talk to Teague about my next paper in English.  We'll see if either of these things actually get done.  It's just, lately, I find I'm lacking the reason to do any of this.</p>
<p>Senioritus?  Maybe.  I thought I left high school a long time ago though...</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, October 2nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="subkagomeicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">The week is over, thankfully.  It was the roughest week all year for me, certainly.  As I mentioned Monday, I've been dealing with a whole bunch in the last month.  September earns the title "Worst Month Ever" for several reasons.</p>
<p>Yah, the money issues have been bad.  I think I spent my money on worthwhile things, though.  My teeth are important, right?!  I can eat carrots again!  That reminds me, I should pick up some.  Also, I feel good spending money on my car.  I feel like I'm establishing a relationship with the bucket of pretty-lookin' bolts.  It's money well spent, and I certainly need my car.  Also, did anyone know I got in a little fender bender on Wednesday?  Yah, it happened.  It wasn't that bad though.  Genevieve said there wasn't even a dent, so that's really not bad.</p>
<p>So today is the LSU game, which is hopefully my last extreme brush with what I like to call the "Bulldawg Nation" mentality.  It's a school of though that encourages ignorance, intoxication, the massive consumption of fossil fuels with countless SUV's and RV's, and the mindless and unexplained worship of football.  Never have I seen something so incredibly boring, especially during games involving those lovable Bulldawgs.  We play, and we play, year in and year out.  Our schedule is loaded with those classic (and at most times very easy-to-win) SEC rivals like Auburn and Tennessee.  They also load us up with some wannabe-winners like Arkansas and Marshall (and just who the <i>fuck</i> is Marshall?!)  And just when we need to win (aka last year's TWO games against LSU and the ill-fated Florida game), we always lose.  It doesn't actually matter, though.  Losing just means you buy the drinks when you go downtown afterward, and of course the ladies are much more sympathetic.  Hopefully you're not one of those sissy faggots, though.  Oh no, they have no place in a Bulldawg Nation.  You might as well be bloodied-up and beaten on a sidewalk outside of Boneshakers before you ever consider yourself a citizen of this great Southern tradition.  I think I will go out tonight, though.  Maybe I will even return the ladies sympathy.  But I'm not wearing red today.  No, I'm wearing Black.</p>
<p>In other news, I thought the debate Thursday was so very entertaining.  Just because Bush and his lackeys say Kerry can't lead a war on terror <i>doesn't</i> mean it's true.  I think alot of people say the difference between fact and spin during those 90 minutes.  It's a shame all of those Bush and Kerry supporters were outside with those raised placards that basically said, "Let me tell you what happened!"  Like we couldn't figure it out ourselves.  Round One:  Kerry.</p>
<p><u>Things I need to do</u>:<p>

<p>I'll do it all later.  At least it's not like Wednesday when I really just didn't do a damn thing except go to work to make money.  By-the-way, all you Dial America haters, I made over $100 in incentives last week alone.  First week ever making incentives.  I got about $14 an hour for working 20 hours last week.  It's like I worked 40 hours at $70 an hour, and all I did was do something productive while all you watched football.  Ha!</p>
<p>Excuse my bitterness.  I'm really not that bad once you get to know me.  Hope I see you all tonight, adios.</p>

<p>So maybe I should be less of an asshole, huh?  So the Bulldawgs won--big surprise for me.  Congratulations boys, I think I may go out tonight to celebrate.  It would be nice to get drunk, but I guess we can't have everything.  Everclear would be so wonderful...oh I wish.  It's been so long :-/</p>
<p>Work sucked.  I hung up on this guy and my supervisor almost caught me.  Also, I got a cancelled sale last week, but thankfully it won't impact my stats too bad and thus I'll get my hefty incentive.  Horray for that.  I just wish we weren't in queue so damn much.  It would be nice to sit back and talk to Tiffany.  I miss that, she didn't even go to lunch with me.</p>
<p>Anyways, see you all around tonight!  Hope everyone is enjoying the Bulldawg's win.
