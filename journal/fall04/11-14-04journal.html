<p><img border="0" src="subkagomeicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">It's hard to be a voice in a place you don't want to be in.  That pretty much sums up my silence, I just don't really care.  Most of my time spent this week consisted of escaping the endless stream of assignments due Friday.  I got the latest Zelda game last week, so I've been plugging away at that.  Also, the now typical iPod related hijinks.  Nothing worth noting, but nonetheless, I'll fill you in.</p>
<p>I despise this idea that, just because we're getting a 3 day break, it means the Friday before said break has to be the end-all due date for about every God-damn assignment on the planet.  I'm sorry for such harsh words, but I had my last English paper, a feature layout, and a 20 second flash movie due that day, and it was all terribly difficult to pull off.  I'm pretty sure I'll score at best a 7.5 landing on the English paper, but if DeHaas is as subjective as I hope she is, maybe I'll come out it all with an 82 or an 85.  I'm shooting for B.  <i>B = Barely made it out in time.</i></p>
<p>Thursday also saw a culmination of a semester of volunteering.  I missed 3 days on a whole, and all for very good reasons (only 2 actual classes).  We ended with some print outs I scrambled to get before heading to get Diane.  We played Bingo, and it's important to note the international appeal of the game.  It's wonderful to see people get so excited about winning a game that requires no skill whatsoever.  We then listened to songs, and I must thank Rand for bringing that aspect to the class.  They enjoyed learning English, but especially through popular music--generally folksy type stuff, if that deserves mention.  It would be nice to go to the party at the end of the semester, but things are really coming to a head, and I will be working that day, among other things for sure.</p>
<p>I don't know what's going to happen to me.  I think I may be alright at the end of all this, but I'm not going to recognize me.  I feel like I'm bleeding, and the loss of blood has left me light headed and just out of touch with reality.  I feel like a balloon, floating to the top of a room.  I feel forgotten, relegated, and alone.  And yet, at the same time, in the smallest sense, I have a piece of something very special inside.  I feel that, although everything, I am good and I am worth something.  I guess that's why I'm having such a hard time with this.  If I am worth so much, if I am doing everything so good, why is this happening to me?</p>
<p>In other non-related news, a certain family crisis has come up that may have me a little extended.  I am not sure where I'll end up this Thanksgiving, but I have a feeling it won't be at home.  And I mean that in an absolutely figurative sense, because after a while, you can never go home.</p>
<p>I just want to sit in the corner of a room a drift away for a while.  I don't have any time, though.  So, that's the end of that.</p>
