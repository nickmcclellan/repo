<p><img border="0" src="lilypissedicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Let me tell you, that Hydrocodone really does a number on me.  Matt took me out to the store for some necessities, and I took my medicine when I got home and all of a sudden I feel a whole lot better.  I mean, I was eating, and I was in some pain, but all of a sudden now, I feel just peachy.  Thank you Hydrocodone :-D</p>
<p>I didn't really do anything this weekend besides play with my personal finances. Yah, I had to take the $800 plus brunt of that surgery, so that put a pretty good dent in my long term. I suppose I'll survive. I set up my Money program to handle downloads from my credit card and banking websites, so it makes balancing my checkbook a whole lot easier. Funny, but as proficient at computers as I am, I have never been good at downloading that type of information. I just have issues w/ Quicken I guess. As much as I'd like to use a Microsoft alternative, it really does work really well for everything I need. What I've learned is I spend too much money eating out (and, with this month in particular, too much on my teeth!) This month's resolution: make more food at home. I hope, since my teeth are better, I can have carrots again :-/</p>
<p>Since I finished my paper, I guess I should start focusing on my public affairs articles.  This whole teeth thing has really had me on edge the past few weeks.  I can finally get working on the things I had planned for this semester!  Everyone has been really understanding, which is good.  I half expected Clay at work to have me working till 4 a.m. on Friday, but he was very understanding.  I suppose they can get a few more weeks out of me.  My teachers were cool with it too.  It's weird, it hasn't been since this year that I've had the type of excuses that people always get excused for.  The surgery, Antonio's funeral...it's kind of strange having these things happen all at once.  Hopefully I can get back to the day-to-day occurrences...any day now!</p>
<p>Well, I'm going to stop and wait patiently for Genevieve.  I got her an ice cream cake and I get to surprise her.  It's her birthday after all, and though I couldn't get her a keg this year, I can spoil her with 10 inches of ice creamy goodness :-D  And then we'll run it off in Savannah or something.</p>
<p>Ok, well, later people!</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, September 16th<br><div align="right"> . . . Happy Anniversary Mom</div></h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="kikyowadeicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">So Hurricane Ivan finally decided to do something instead of churning out in the ocean.  He cancelled my class, turned off all my TV's, and shut off my internet.  Thanks Ivan, I needed that.</p>
<p>The class thing is fine with me, though.  We had actually started, and then it was like God came on over the intercom and told us all to go home because of the inclement weather.  It was great, Professor Teague was like, "Wait!  I have to show you something on Galileo!"  Well, we stayed for that, and then I walked to my car in the rain.  An hour early, I was huddled in Memorial Hall with my new Lambda friend because of the tornado warning.  My roommate tells me that it touched down by Milledge.  I was sort of hoping it would blow the stadium away.  I think it would be really interesting to see what happed to "Bulldawg Nation" if the capital city is taken off the map.  Viva la Resistance!</p>
<p>Now I'm just sort of huddled in my dark room listening to Matt's songs.  They're nice.  I wanted to share what the last week has been like for me.  Basically, the surgery has been the focus point of emotion for me.  It was a breeze of course, it didn't hurt, it was just an annoyance, monetarily and logistically.  I hated the gauze in my mouth.  I hated how I was dizzy and could not remain conscious on the way home or even when I was waiting for my sister to get the damned apple sauce.  Matt came over on Friday and took care of me.  I think we slept alot, but by the evening I was walking around with my puffy face and we went to Barberitos to get a burrito.  We watched <i>Beetle Juice</i> finally, and then he went off to work for the weekend.</p>
<p>My other weekend activities did <i>not</i> include work, but instead a whole new sinister selfish type of work.  Basically, thanks to sweep of Maypril's friend's page, I came across an online thing Evan was involved in (see links above).  This "FreeiPod.com" deal works like this:  I participate in an "easily cancelable" offer online and goad 5 of my friends to do the same thing.  I've combed over the terms many times, and I have to get 5 unique people to do it, so I had lined up Matt, Mom, Jen, Laura, and Genevieve.  Well, I've since expanded my effort and have gotten 2 likely completed offers from other means.  I even went onto some message boards and netted some people, but I'm still waiting to see if they complete offers.  It's a pretty groovy plan they've got going.  I know they make a good amount of money by just getting one person to sign up for the offer, and I'm doing all the footwork to get people to join, so it's a sweet deal for them, no catch (trust me, it's rough convincing your friend to sign up for a "free trial").  I've nonetheless been rather successful, and will keep everyone informed on the status of my iPod.  I expect that by the end of the weekend I'll have 5 people and then they just have to verify the shipping address.  It's just so cool if I can screw this company out of an iPod.  The fun thing for me is that I am neither willing nor able to get an iPod myself, <i>but I'll still get one</i>!  Trust me.</p>
<p>I just feel bad about asking people to do the whole "free trial" thing.  But then again, I ask strangers to do this all the time at Dial America, and at least this way I can tell my friends how to get themselves out of these deals.  I don't want people to think it's a scam.  This is my job, people.  I know what I'm doing.  Trilegiant taught me well (those slimy bastards).</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm going to save my battery strength for another hour.  I think I'll go through a ball at a wall, or I'll go watch the storm.  Looting would be fun.  Here's to looting!</p>
<p>BTW, I have made a decision.  Effective January 2005, my website will no longer be located on GeoCities (aka Yahoo!)  I'm moving over to the much less restrictive UGA server, at least for the last semester.  I can have more leeway with Perl scripting and such there, and you have a better chance of seeing a comment page on that end than you do in this restrictive prison.  I bet that ad on the top right side of your screen is annoying.  Well, that's all going away very soon.  Promise!  Until then, see my academic website creations <a href="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/" target="_blank">here</a>.  I just have a resume and blurb now.  Expect amazing innovations soon though.  Also, they may spill here, but you're in for the best update ever in January.  I'm going to be delicious.  I can't wait.</p>
<p>I really love this stuff :-D</p>
<p>Fear the hurricane!  Take shelter friends, and let's hope there's no class tomorrow...</p>
