<p><img border="0" src="mirrorshirlicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I've been thinking of doing something drastic.  Three months is a long time, and it's a time I don't want to spend normally.  Normal time consists of typical depressing December goings-on.  Going home is a part of that, certainly, so that is the first to be eliminated.  Having a job during the holiday is also a depressing necessity, and starting today, that's no longer going to be an issue.  I'm quitting Dial America because my sanity can't take it any longer, I need to escape.  I having completely ruled out a Christmas job though.  I think if I hustle like I did last year, if I can at least make a grand, that would do wonders for my debt which is sadly on the rise again.</p>
<p>I was thinking of spending 3 full weeks in Ohio and getting a job up there.  That's really drastic, I think, and I don't know if its entirely possible.  Transplanting myself completely in another state, if only on a temporary basis, would be interesting.  I wouldn't have to stay with at my Grandma's apartment for every waking hour.  I may make some friends in Ohio that I could hang out with, again, only for a time.  I would also have an interesting income tax dilemma in January, which I'm just so interested in causing.  I don't think I could be that much of a burden on my mother, though, and I sort of feel like taking it real easy this Christmas.  I need a break so bad, because next year is going to be the worst of all (and hopefully the best).  I'll not look to the horizon before I've weathered the dusk, though.</p>

<p>This is from quite a while ago.  I actually finally beat the silly game in my website class where I had access to an actual mouse as opposed to this annoying "touch square" on my laptop.  As glamorous and high-tech this laptop is, the mouse could be so much better, but I suppose it's about give and take.</p>
<p>As for my attempt to swindle my cousin out of her Photoshop glory, that failed miserably.  I was, however, able to get a promise from my cousin that as soon as he has dealt with aformentioned family affairs and he's back in Atlanta at work, he'd burn me some program disks and product keys so that I can have my very own pirated Photoshop, Macromedia Studio MX, and dare I say, Microsoft Word 2003.  I may hold off on the flashy new Word because it's really not necessary, but it would be a nifty bonus.  With said software, my website update in January will be quite a sight.</p>
<p>Regardless of increased technological savvy, do expect something very different.  I think it would be more exciting graphically with all those add-ons, that would be the only setback if I didn't get those programs.  Despite anything, my last Blog will be unlike all the others.  I aim for more varied icons, a sleeker display, and possibly a comments page.  Oh, yes, and all of these innovations will be on the UGA server as opposed to this oppressive wasteland that is Geocities.</p>
<p>Pardon my decrease in Blog-attentiveness, I am not well.  The fact that I'm so wordy even know is disturbing, so this may be the only entry this week, sadly.  We'll see.  I may do single entry updates over the break instead of the usual weekly treatment.  Also, I think I will be explaining myself before the end of the semester, but I'm not ready yet.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting.</p>

<p>My mother actually asked me if Jen had called to tell me, but I was in the process of calling her on my dysfunctional cell phone.  Cingular picks funny times to have service outages.  Anyways, after I heard, I went up the street to call Jen a few times to no avail.  I talked to my mom about it for a little bit, tried to call my Aunt, but the service outage wouldn't have it.  Also, conveniently, my house phone has been disconnected thanks to <i>worthless irresponsible deadbeat ex-roommate</i> (of course I mean Marilia).  Yah, so I came home, and did this.</p>
<p>I don't know if I've made my peace or not, but I sure hope he has.  I hope he's in a place where that can happen if for some reason he couldn't find it here.  I don't see how this is a beautiful life.  There are so many horrible things, so many sad things, that so many people ignore.  It isn't until they are shoved into your world that you realize just how horrible life really can be.</p>
<p>I loved my Uncle George.  He was a good man, I believe, and I think I can separate the man from the disease.  The man may have faded a long time ago, but I remember him.  There was this time, after I got out of 4th grade, when we went on a vacation with my Aunt across America.  I had given into the ridicule of others, believing their cruel words.  My uncle, after hearing me refer to myself as this seeming "subhuman" promptly set me straight, telling me that I was indeed a worthy person and that I should not demean myself so.  I always remembered that, and I wonder if he remembered how much that helped me at the time.</p>
<p>I feel good that I said a prayer for him last night.  Maybe that will mean something.  I feel, in a world like this, all I have is prayer.
