<div class="post">
<p><img name="Icon" src="kikyowadeicon.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Stay Kagome" align="left" hspace="5">I had to pick an icon for this. I don't have any icons for this. I make icons because I think it's fun, but this isn't fun. Maybe that's why I've put it off so much, but I picked this icon.</p>
<p>Kikyo is walking into the water. She's lost between the world of the living and the world of the dead. She doesn't know where she belongs, and there's a look in her eyes. It's almost as if she's being watched. My interpretation is that she is dying, and she's waiting. She's waiting for someone to follow her in.</p>
<p>In any case, she's completely insane. For the past three months, I have felt completely insane. It all started after I had my wisdom teeth out (as odd as that sounds). Since the beginning of this semester, I have been thinking of the future. I knew I was going to graduate, I knew that I wanted to go to Europe in the summer. I knew that I was in love with Matt, and I wanted to take him with me. I wanted him to be there, as long as he could.</p>
<p>On the night of the hurricane, I sat in my room by candlelight and listened to &quot;Sara.&quot; It was a surreal experience, hearing the chaos around me. After the squall, Matt came over to hang out, which always helped to cheer me up. It was a night I will never forget.</p>
<p>He told me that he was leaving. He said that he hated Athens and that he wanted to move to another city where he could start over again. I was shell-shocked, because Matt's depression was never a secret, but running away from his problems&#8212;to me at least&#8212;seemed to be the wrong solution. I'm not even sure if it was about his depression, necessarily, but that's what I thought it was instantly. I cried like I had never cried before (first time in years even), and the endless tug-of-war between him and I began. At first he said he would stay since I was obviously a wreck without him, though he said he would be essentially dead here. I couldn't let that happen, I told him he should leave, but I didn't want to leave him (as impossible as that sounds).</p>
<p>There was one day I thought was very chilling. He picked me up to take me out to dinner with his friends at Stevi B's, and he was a different person. He was depressed, obviously, and he was especially upset about his car (my car was in the shop at the time, or I would have driven). I tried to comfort him, to tell him about how I was championing CSS and how that was pretty cool, but he refused to get out of his mood. Miraculously, when we arrived to dinner with his friends, he was able to project the same old quirky Matt. It was so disturbing just to experience that, but I suppose I've experienced it since we started dating. He always projected his true face to me.</p>
<p>I've noticed that since way back in 2003, during Missy's birthday. We were walking downtown and he had had alot to drink. He was going on about how I was not paying attention to him or something&#8212;he tends to get especially depressed when he drinks. I wasn't going to ignore him, so I sat with him for what seemed like an hour talking to him outside of some bar Missy wanted to go to. He told me how he hated himself, how he resented his parents. He talked about the hell that was high school for him, and unlike all the others, I refused to let such a confession go out without dealing with it. Missy and Genevieve came around, slightly annoyed with me, as they didn't really understand what it was I had to do for him. I just wanted to be there for him, I realize how horrible depression can be, and I love him so much, I couldn't let him handle all of that alone.</p>
<p>Anyways, for most of the year, I think he made alot of headway. He went to councelling. He got a job. He got some really awesome help from his Grandmother. Last summer was the best summer of my life because I spent it with him. I would get off work (and work was truly hellish), and I would call him, and whether or not I saw him, it was still the best night of my life because he was on the other end of the line. Sometimes he would come over, or I would spend time with his friends. It was like things were finally coming together. No more manipulations of my friends to drive us around. No school to distract us. It was me and him, and I was throughly happy. You have no idea what it feels like to belong to someone, to feel confident in the fact that they would never hurt you, that you were safe&#8212;and again, happy.</p>
<p>This fall has been absolute hell. His decision has thrown my whole world into complete disarray. I changed everything for him. I am a different person as a result of my relationship with him, and my separation from him has left me broken and quite honestly, very depressed. I don't really know what I'm expected to do, what I'm supposed to do. I'm leaving, and because of all this, I'm really looking forward to that. What am I supposed to do here? Am I supposed to start over? Am I supposed to start a new relationship? I don't want that, I thought I did for a while, but I realized that I am not ready. Everything here seems so sullied and complicated. I feel like there's nothing here for me, and even if there is, I'm too fucked up in the head to even fathom subjecting anyone to it.</p>
<p>That's right, I'm crazy. I've been crazy for a very long time. What he has done to me is very wrong. How can you treat your boyfriend of over a year like he were some fleeting high school fling? How can these feelings be the product of some immaterial obsession? His abuse and neglect of me is very wrong, but there was nothing I could do to stop it, though I continue to try very earnestly and persistantly. He left, very slowly, and now he's at his parents house. Sometimes he's in Athens, though he's sure to sublease that place and eventually get a place downtown (or someplace nicer).</p>
<p>It's very difficult for me, you have no idea. He leaves me nothing. I have done so much for him, I was there for him when no one else could even understand what he was going through&#8212;in moments no one would even think of him . I was there that night he told me how he hated himself. I left my best friend on her birthday so that we could go home and talk about what he had said. I never ignored or neglected him, I always did everything I could for him. I was there when Barry wrote in his LiveJournal how he despised Matt (ironically his best friend), and I was there to tell him that Barry was a complete dick to say something like that to him (don't even get me started on Barry). I invested so much of myself into him. I think the world of him, and he left me. He ran away from everything, and now I have to deal with all of it. The depression, the betrayal. It's so difficult sometimes, I just can't stand sitting here and letting these feelings fester. I wish I could run away too. I want to leave this awful place and have my new beginning.</p>
<p>But I am stuck. I'm have to finish my degrees, I'm  have to deal with his issues, and mine. Maybe then, I can  get the hell out of here. Hopefully all of this will be a wonderful motivating factor to launch me toward a successful career. I have some ideas, and now is the time to get it done.</p>
<p>I never wanted to do this, but here it is. It's not a concession, it's really a confession. In all of this, I've learned one thing: <em>I love Matt</em>. I will always love Matt, and I will never let go of that. I did everything I could for him, and I was as good to him as I have ever treated anyone. In the end, his decision to leave is what has caused me pain. It was nothing I did. I am determined to remain in his life because I care for him very deeply. I am hopeful that one day he will understand what he did to me was wrong and will make some effort to rectify it, if he can. I think that would mean something to me, but I have no power over that. Sadly, I have nothing.</p>
<p>So that's it. I have hopefully hidden this entry enough so that only the most determined Bloggers have any idea what it is I have had to deal with. I wouldn't wish this on anyone, but if it ever happens to you, please realize you're not alone. We all have our cross to bear.</p>
<p>And this was mine.</p>
<p><em>By the way, there are two entries that were previously unreleased&#8212;mostly because they revealed too much, but I wrote them anyways. I used this cool HTML trick to hide them, so they were actually there all along, but unless you viewed the source, you never saw them. One is just some lyrics I transcriped. The other one is a classic depressing entry (that I surprisingly posted as a test entry for my new Blog, and recieved an uplifting comment moments later). I won't tell you where they are, so happy hunting. </em>
