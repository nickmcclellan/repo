<p><img border="0" src="kikyowatchicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Every year is slightly different.  It's typically bad though, this last Thursday in November.  Last year probably wasn't as obvious, but it was bad in a very subtle way.  This year is worse, obviously, because my uncle George is dying and there's really nothing anyone can do about it.  Plus, compounded with my issues, at times I feel choaked and very sad.  It makes me wonder how people have the strength to feel good in such a horrible and betraying world.  My only explanation is that they just don't know.  Most people are ignorant to real pain and real emotion.  Even now I don't know how low you can go, and yet, I expect I feel I'm the most troubled person in the world.  It's just not true.</p>
<p>I feel a pain that I hope would one day would fade away.  Each day that becomes less and less likely and I'm faced with a very difficult conclusion that I'm unable to grip.  I may resolve to be the better man and vow never to be so careless and cold with the emotions and feelings of others.  In the end, though, it's an empty resolution, and that's not what I'm looking for.  I need a constitution.</p>
<p>Jennifer called me last Saturday night to tell me that my uncle was in the hospital.  My cousins and my aunt, his ex-wife, were on their way to Sebring, Florida, where he lives, to see him and be with him in what was likely his final hour.  However, that did not occur, he is still living, but is unable to live without the medicine and machince that care for him.  My older cousin, John Paul, is burdened with being the next-of-kin, since my aunt has divorced my uncle.  He has to make the difficult decisions of whether to put my uncle in a nursing home or a hospice.  It's hopeless now, though he is barely aware, but he will die.  He has drunk himself to this point, and all that's left is to stop fighting the inevitable and let it happen.</p>
<p>What troubles me is why my uncle is dying.  He's an alcoholic and gambling addict.  His family has supported him until serious health issues began to arise and he was hospitalized a few years ago.  In the aftermath of that liver failure, my mother and my aunt and cousins got together to intervene in George's life.  Ultimately, it is the addict's decision on whether or not to help himself, and George choose the latter.  He promptly left Ridgeview and I think that was probably why my mother is not here now.  She probably feels he died a long time ago and all that was left was the addiction.  I think that's how I feel too, but I have a lot of hope that the man will realize that this is the end and he will say what he needs to say.  I'm still waiting.</p>
<p>I saw him this morning.  A gathered few of us sat with him to watch the Thanksgiving Parade with him.  I think he's probably just a little confused by seeing people like me and Jennifer.  I wish he knew what it meant.  I wish he knew I felt that I loved him very much and wanted to support him and his family in any way I could.  Right now, I think he's still lost in himself, he kept reaching for the various tubes in an attempt to shead the ties that keep him in that hospital so he can return home.  I know he want's to walk away, but he can't, and I wish he'd realize that.  I wish, for just a moment, he'd take responsiblity for his condition and tell his family that he loves them.  I wish he can find a peace before he must go.  I think we all deserve that, but this whole situation has made me think that perhaps that's not possible.  Perhaps we all die tortured, desperate, and alone.</p>
<p>It's a bit too much for me to take, at times, and I just wish the things that I had to make me feel better would suddenly appear to comfort me.  I guess I will mess with Laura's Photoshop, even though I probably can't put the same copy on my computer, it's worth a Turkey day try.</p>
<p>This whole situation makes me wonder what the deaths of my parents will be like.  My mother told me that I would be her next-of-kin and informed me of her wishes.  I suppose that's just a formality, but I sure hope she'll be around for a while.  Making these choices will be difficult, but as horrible as they are, death is inevitable, and it's important to have things like this that make you realize how precious and fragile we all are.</p>
<p>Ok, I'm not sure when you'll get this, but maybe when I return to civilization.  I feel like I've fallen off the face of the Earth here in Central Florida.  Yuck.  Here's hoping I never have to come here again.</p>
