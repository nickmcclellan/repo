<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="buffygloryicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I'm just a little bit insane at the moment.  The fact that I'm still breathing surprises me.  I'm sitting here, chewing on carrots, letting the time just trickle by.  I've put off the binge drinking article yet again, now I'm going to write it tonight.  I have an outline in my head though.  I have most of the info I need, it's going to be good, I just need to write it.  Good luck to me on that.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm feeling just a little insane right now.  Angry, mostly, at alot of things.  Mostly, at the current state of things.  Why is it so hard for me to write an article for Public Affairs?  I have two ideas for this week that had better pan out.  One of them should be easy as pie, the other should be a boundary breaking adventure in Outlook (aka my e-mail client).  If I can manage those sometime tomorrow, I think I'll be ok for now.  Two articles plus a binge drinking piece should do alot for my sanity.</p>
<p>Also, I'm feeling some minimal pressue at this point from a Mr. William Shakespeare.  I have a paper due at 5 p.m. on Friday.  I need to talk to the professor about my topic and my last paper so I know what I'm doing wrong.  I want to do a topic on Ian McKellen's <i>Richard III</i>.  I want to talk about this thing we talk about in class, "public and private."  I don't know exactly what it means, which is why I want to clarify with the professor.  Anyways, there are some interesting scenes in the movie, and I guess I can discuss how they compliment a Mr. William Shakespeare, if he doesn't mind.  For my last paper in the class, which is probably due in about a month, I want to talk about the gender implications of <i>Forbidden Planet</i>, which is the movie we watched last week.  I mean, when I was watching the thing, I thought PENIS OVERLOAD!  It was nuts (<i>literally</i>), and it just got me thinking it would be an interesting topic to address.  So, yah, an A on one of those will do wonders for my sanity.</p>
<p>I'm still reaching though.  My editing class is going really well, which leads me to believe I have a knack for editing instead of writing.  I love to write, don't get me wrong, but I mostly like to hear myself talk, and I don't like to think about what I write, so I guess that makes me a sucky news writer.  I'm going to do something <i>today</i> about becoming a copy editor at the Red & Black for the rest of the semester, or at least for the Spring.  I'm also doing well, website-wise.  If you didn't see my creation, well, it's finished...</p>
<p align="center"><b>If you want to see my class website, click <a href="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi" target="_blank">here</a></b></p>
<p>It's beautiful, with just the tiniest errors all over the place.  Next up is a website I'm going to make for my cousin to show off her work.  It will be a good thing for me because I will have my first client.  Maybe after this, I can start hitting up local businesses to make websites for them.  I'd like to get a job someplace that had me learning more and more about web design.  It's something I really enjoy, and I can see myself doing it for a very long time.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've used too much battery for now.  I'll say one other thing about my sanity.  Oddly enough, Genevieve has agreed to sell me her acoustic guitar for $40.  This makes me unusually elated, as I've always wanted to learn how to play guitar.  For some reason, I have this dream of being a twenty-something in some lounge in some city playing "Medication" to a bunch of people.  One of these people is this guy from my high school, and he's shocked to see my talent, maturity, and skill.  Strange little goal of mine, but I think slowly learning to play an instrument would be good for my soul.  Also, I'll be catching up to Nicole on my list of accomplisments.  I have one more accomplisment on my list than she has on hers, though.</p>
<p>Beat Nicole.</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, October 20th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="mirrorshirlicon.jpg" hspace="5" align="left">I haven't heard The Smiths "Asleep" for a while.  I'm listening to it now, and it's very soothing.  So much more haunting than "I Know It's Over," which, in my opinion, is just too loaded.  As far as sleep anthems go, my personal favorites are garbage's "Sleep", "You Look So Fine", and "So Like A Rose."  "Sleep" for obvious reasons, and "You Look So Fine", probably because the first time I really listened to that song, I was sitting in my car waiting for Jennifer to come in from Kroger.  We both used to work there, and she was probably getting her paycheck or something.  It was raining, and I just remember that whole line about, "Let's pretend / Happy end" playing over and over again while there was a light drizzle on my wind shield.  It was very relaxing.</p>
<p>I just like "So Like A Rose," and any song that comes on at the end of a garbage album is usually a sleep anthem.  "Milk" not so much, but anyways, I don't know how I got onto this train of thought.  I guess I'd like to write about music today.  I think I'd like to share with you the songs that I like and what they mean to me.  So, here goes:</p>

<td width="200" align="center"><b class="music">Ayumi Hamasaki - <i>Dearest</i></b><br><br>
<img src="dearest.jpg"></td>
<td width="10"></td>
<td width="570" align="justify"><i class="inside">This is a very special song from the end credits of Inuyasha.  It was actually the end credits that started at the end of the episode when Kanna reverses the wind scare, severely injuring Inuyasha.  It was revealed that Kikyo was responsible for giving Naraku the power needed to hurt Inuyasha like this, and the tone at the end of the episode was that of unexplained betrayal.  Why did Kikyo do something like that to Inuyasha?  "Dearest" begins in much the same way the episode ends, with each character reflecting on the current state of things.<br><br>
This song makes me think of Matt.  It's very sweet, yet sad, though overall comforting.  Ayumi has a beautiful voice, and she really captures the emotion of the moment, at least in the episode.  Why I think of Matt, I don't really know.  I guess the song's just innocent enough to do the guy justice, that's all. It's a testament to the good guys, when you feel like you've got nothing left, but one more thing.</td>

<td width="10"></td>
<td width="570" align="justify"><i class="inside">I was actually told to download this song from a friend that I knew who lived in California.  I think I was listening to "Blue Monday" at the time, and he told me that I should check this song out.  I downloaded it once, and I swear, I didn't listen to it again for about 6 months.  It wasn't until I heard it on a commercial for one of those 80's CDs the I truly recognized how much this song rocked.<br><br>
There have been many of a night at Boneshakers when I had to drop everything to dance to this little ditty.  I can even recall a few of those times to be extremely pleasant, and a few that were extremely ackward.  This song doesn't really mean that much to me, it's just a fun song I like to sing and dance to.  Other than that, it belongs to no one else.</td>

<td width="570" align="justify"><i class="inside">Funny thing about this song.  I didn't even like it that much.  I mean, "Rhiannon" to me was alot better, I guess I just understood the story better.  I don't know, but there was something about that nasty hurricane that blew in here a few weeks ago that just got me closer to this song.  We didn't have any power, and I was writing one of my Blogs, and all of a sudden "Sara" came on.<br><br>
In all the wind and the rain, lightning and thunder, I guess I just heard it for the first time.  It's a really touching and beautiful song.  Like everything else, it reminds me of Matt.  He gave me the mega-mix of Fleetwood Mac that now invests my hard drive, and this song really captures its infection in my heart.  It's just so sad sometimes, it makes me want to cry.</td>

<p>Ok, I'll stop showing off my HTML skills with complex tables and a masterful manipulation of text.  I'm sorry, but if you can View Source anything, take a look at that table.  Written by hand, thank you very much.  Maybe it's not as impressive as I probably could be (and will be), but I've come along way from having Jeremy make tables for me on his computer so I could use them on mine.  Now I am the master.</p>
<p>So, enough music for today.  I really wish that iPod will be mailed already.  I know it's a waiting game, but I think I'm just killing my laptop's power supply on a daily basis when I plug in like this just to listen to music.  When I'm all iPod in my music habits, I suspect I will stay off this portable idiot machine more often.  I can't really tell if Winamp takes up substantial power supply, it's hard to say.  God knows the wireless internet sure does, so it's a good thing I've kept away from that.</p>
<p>In other me news, I am considering going to Las Vegas in January.  I haven't decided what I want to do about that.  It would be a nice vacation, but vacations are the last thing that I need to think about right now.  January is so far away from now, it seems, anyways.  Gambling and "free drinks", as Jennifer has pointed out, also seem to be a moot point in comparison to things now.  I am thinking I may have some miraculous moment of perspective sometime soon, and I'll decide to go.  It gets me out of this hell hole for a good weekend, at the very least.</p>
<p>John also invited me to D.C. on Inauguration Day.  I would only consider the trip if John Kerry won, because I have this aversion to see President Bush shaking his "Bon Bon" on stage again with Ricky Martin.  What the hell was he thinking?!  In related news, there's this charming bumper sticker I pass every day that says, "The road to hell is paved with Republicans."  Something to consider.</p>
<p>Alright, I should really stop and track down a fax machine.  Wish me luck.</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, October 22nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="halfdemoninuicon.jpg" hspace="5" align="left">I want to buy some clothes.  I want some nicer t-shirts.  There's a new Strong Sad t-shirt on Homestarrunner.com, but I'm not sure if that's what I want.  I saw this Bubble Bobble shirt on eBay that was right up my alley, but I think the auction was in pounds, so I was sure the price would be way too much for me to bother.</p>
<p>I want some jeans or khakis too.  All of these things are so expensive, and I'm on a tight budget.  I think if I worked into February, I'll be able to pay it all off on my credit card.  As long as I'm still working, everything will balance out.</p>
<p>I wrote my Shakespeare paper last night, which was a relief.  It's nice finally getting all that stuff done for once.  I had planned on writing the draft on Tuesday, but something steered me home instead.  I find, lately, that I get home I just sort of collapse into whatever state of conciousness that has me doing absolutely nothing productive whatsoever.  I mean, last night, I suppose it was the upbeat conversation I had with DeHaas that got me to at least work on the paper so I would have a day to consider it, but I spent most of the early afternoon watching clips from SNL of Celebrity Jeopardy (which, by the way, is one of the only things that makes me smile).  "I'll take Anal Bum Covers for $400, Alex." . . . "That's  'An Album Cover'!"</p>
<p>Laura came over last night though, and her and Jennifer modeled off their beautiful dresses for me.  They are going to some Citadel formal tonight and are spending the weekend in Charleston.  I'm taking care of the dog, which is probably the only time I like the dog.  At all other times, me and the dog just don't get along.  I suppose it's nothing personal, but she sits in my chair.  I guess I feel threatened.</p>
<p>By the way, not sure if I mentioned it or not, but I found something on Cingular.com that let me put a picture on my phone background.  I have my cool Inuyasha picture on it, which is the icon I've chosen for today.  Marvel at the personal innovation!</p>
<p>Another miserable weekend at Dial America.  What else is new?</p>
