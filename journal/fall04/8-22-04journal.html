<p><img border="0" src="ccbicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">This week has started over pretty good.  I had a busy day.  I saw all the important sexy beautiful people of my life, including long-lost others...like Mary-Kate!  One person was missing.  I miss Laura :-(  My sexy sorority girl has seemingly drifted into a galaxy far, far away, where she is loved by a real man, and not me.  It's ok though, but I still miss her.  I wish it was Genevieve's party again and I was hanging out w/ her again.  We had such a fun time.</p>
<p>I walked alot today.  I went from SLC to Red & Black to Off Campus Bookstore to FTX to <i>Barberitos</i> (in downtown Athens), and then back to the SLC again.  My feet really hurt, and I'm probably going to have blisters.  I had a good work out though!  I just wish I had my bike with me.  Going down Baxter hill would have been a breeze if I had that 8-)</p>
<p>I guess as a bonafide regular Lambda Joe Schmo, I have the liberty to comment on tonight's meeting.  Matt was by far the sexiest guy in the room.  The stuffy new Juniors have their limited stale appeal, but Matt was in the daddy pants tonight and he had his shit together, and that's really sexy.  He is by far the sexiest guy on the Board, and I'm his boyfriend!  Got that newbies!  He's mine.</p>
<p>Well, other than sexy Matt, everyone sure had alot of suggestions for Lambda.  I heard alot of the same stuff from alot of the usual suspects.  What I thought was really interesting was the fact that people had alot of good ideas and criticisms, but they were likely to <i>never</i> step in that room again or participate in the organization to follow through on their proposed solutions.  It's annoying when they criticize Lambda at the expense of the previous Board.  I mean, I walked hours in the summer sun last year to get clever door prizes for the picnic!  I put flyers all over campus with Milo and Marilia so the new freshman would know where and when are first meeting was!  There were days I single-handedly staffed that Office with no help from my fellow Board members to provide a "much needed resource" to our gay community!  I don't think I can stomach too much of this organization this year, I feel like I've given enough (though receiving the SOAR Award helps alleviate my frustration).  I'll help Matt though.  I love to help Matt.</p>
<p>The suggestions reached a new level of annoyance, prompting Cat to point out, "Now people are just enjoying hearing themselves talk."  Too true.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="kagomebucketicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I finally got Service Pack 2 on my computer...I've oddly been looking forward to this, I don't know why.  The prospect of an update to Internet Explorer and the wireless connection utility on my computer was just titilating.  Very odd.  I uninstalled my dependable pop-up stopper.  Goodbye Panicware.  You were good to me. :'(</p>
<p>Today was my busy day, but it turned out to be pretty cool.  I was running around alot, but my 2 hour break at the SLC was useful.  I got most of my Simpsons article written, and it turned out to be pretty good (at least I think).  I wished I could have spent more time on it, but I've been so drained because of classes lately.  I'm just going to so many things, and tomorrow I'm going to an info session about volunteering to teach English as a second language to Hispanic people.  I figure it will help my Spanish since I'm not taking a class this semester.  AND Friday at 2pm, I need to go the Red & Black and get the ball rolling there.  My lecture in Advanced Editing made it more obvious than ever that I need some experience.  I think it's possible, but I've got to work.  Things are going to be so busy, I just hope I have enough steam to take me to December.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm tired of dealing with people that won't listen to me.  I'll be around.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="milkbfasticon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Oh, I'm going straight to hell for this.  It was so horrible, though under normal circumstances, I would have laughed so much, but I feel so horrible about it.  Anyways, I was getting my bike off the rack and I saw David so I was going to go say hi.  I was crossing the Sanford just about 500 ft. from the light at Baldwin.  Well, coming down the hill was this guy on his bike, and I was just sort of waddling down the street (which is one way by the way) and had to stop so he could get by.  It was really sad, because he paniced, swirved, and spilled out all over the street in front of me.  I felt so bad for him.  Of course, he was going the wrong way, but I shouldn't have been in the middle of the street like that.  To think about it, though, this one day last Spring had me spilling out on the pavement on my way to Spanish.  It was a really bad day for it too, because it was the day I knew I had to find two roommates for my apartment ASAP, and that wipe out just had me really aggrivated.  But anyways...</p>
<p>I called Marilia to talk to her about a bunch of things and she made me feel real good.  I probably didn't mention much about this, but about 2 months ago, Marilia and I got into a hugemongous fight that had me in tears and screaming at the top of my lungs.  It wasn't a pleasant conversation, surely, and I thought it would have a lasting impact on our friendship.  It turns out things are alright, and despite her moving away, I still find myself calling her, asking for her advice, and basically bonding over alot of things.  Her and I have grown up together in the past year, and we understand eachother (more or less).  I'm just happy things worked out between us, because it was kind of iffy there for a while.</p>
<p>On the semester front, I did something very interesting yesterday.  Heeding the obnoxiously active nature of my friends Jeremy and Diane, I opted for an info session on volunteering at St. Joseph's teaching English as a second language to members of the community who need it.  It was very interesting, and it fits moderatly well into my schedule:  Thursday from about 7 until 9 p.m.  I would probably just sit around anyways, right?  Well, I scarfed cookies and caffeine free Pepsi and signed up to teach with Diane (Matt's roommate) and this guy Rand.  I told Jeremy and a collected few that this was a dream in life, to have control over a small group of people :-D  We get to make lesson plans and everything, and I think it might keep me somewhat immersed in Spanish, or at least give me something to feel good about.  I've been at odds this week with a few people, and going to that info session has really cleared my head.  I feel that if I keep myself busy, there's really nothing to be worried about.  I have alot of ambitious goals this semester, and I think I'm on the right track to fulfilling them.  Also, I think I might go see a movie with Matt tonight, and I love hanging out with him.</p>
<p>If only I didn't work this weekend >:o  That's the only thing about working on the weekends.  <i>Where'd the weekend go?!?</i></p>
