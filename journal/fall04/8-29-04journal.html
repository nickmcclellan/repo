<p><img border="0" src="kikyosofticon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">This is my favorite new icon.  I am obsessed with Kikyo, everything about her is so very tragic.  You half hope that she can be happy and get what she wants because she's always had a hard knock life of responsiblity and twists of unfortunate circumstance.  On the other hand, acknowledging her selfish and self-destructive nature, you must admit that she deserves her sad fate.  The's a little bit of Kikyo in all of us: wishing we had just a little bit more, even though we don't deserve it.  But that doesn't mean we don't get it.</p>
<p>Anyways, my weekend's over, and it was nice.  Despite some pain of the dental variety, I had a good day at work on Saturday.  I made some good sales and got to hang out w/ Tiffany, and she invited me to her birthday party.  She's really cool.  Her boyfriend works with Gen, and she told me that if Nick (her b/f) ever invited Gen out or anything, that I should assume it's an invitation for me as well.  Well, I haven't seen her outside of our cubicle yet, but I am looking forward to the opportunity where we can converse while standing around--hopefully with a moderate buzz among new friends.  Today had me bored mostly, and doing my best to make sure Kia didn't vomit all over me.  I convinced her to get out of there early, and I took her back to her place so she wouldn't have to walk home in the rain.  I like the people I have met at Dial America.  They are very cool, and it's nice meeting new people.  It would be nice to see Grace more often though :'(</p>
<p>On Saturday, Marilia came over and (as always) opened my eyes to alot of things.  She even got me a new backpack because she knew Missy had misplaced mine.  It blew my mind that she did that for me.  It really reiterates how amazed how far her and I have come:  from yelling at eachother in the kitchen to conversing about twentysomethings on a Saturday night.  We went to see <i>Beetlejuice</i> at Tate with Laura (who's getting a Friends Page any day now!)  I love the scene w/ the singing and dancing and attacking shrimp.  Michael Keaton just rocks as Betelgeuse.  Who knew that man can be that versatile an actor.  I only wish Matt could have watched it with me.  It's one of <i>those</i> movies he's never seen.  Despite his absense, I enjoyed myself.  The midnight movie at Tate has always been a college favorite of mine--especially of the 80's variety.</p>
<p>So, maybe I'll have homework this week?  Maybe Megan from the Red & Black will actually show up for our meeting on Tuesday?  Maybe the Republican National Convetion will make me vomit, but I'm going to watch it!  Can't wait to make some comparisons between Bush and Kerry.  I'm taking a shot everytime I hear the word "freedom" and I don't think I'll be able to see straight on Friday ;-)</p>
<p>Later folks</p>

<p><img border="0" src="mirrorshirlicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">In the last few days, I've been doing alot of website tweaking.  This may be distracting for the regular Blog reader, but I assure you, things are getting better.  For example, you may have noticed the nifty new comment option.  Once a distant dream of mine, it is now a reality (somewhat).  I've always wanted to have this interactivity because it's my way of conforming to everyone's livejournal without actually getting one.  Good for me :-)  I'm trying to make my own personalized comment page without borrowing the Geocities guestbook.  Let's face it...I can do without <i>that</i> banner.  Oh well...</p>
<p>Just to let you know, if you see that comment page disappear at any point, don't take it personally.  I want comments!  It's just the instrument you need to make those comments is still under construction.  Pardon my progress please ;-)  Well, in other change related news, there's a much better looking "Current Music/Mood" indicator.  Yah, It's hard to place text in an HTML document exactly where you want.  I remember when the prospect of using a table on any of my webpages was <i>way</i> over my head, but now I'm using them to manipulate text and make pretty groovy visual elements.  Even the comment page seemed like an impossibility months ago, but now I'm toying with program scripts, testing the waters.  I really enjoy this stuff, and it's making me feel like a career making these webpages might be right up my alley.  I would like to work on NYTimes.com, certainly.  I think I could layout an attractive news web page.  I wonder if they pay good?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw <i>Outfoxed</i> at the Tate center with Kyle and Paul.  There was some short movie on before that feature about the independent media.  All in all, they were interesting films, but they depressed the hell out of me.  On one facet, it's not secret to me that Fox News is extremely biased in their news reporting, so it seems seeing the movie is a moot point.  On the other hand, as an aspiring journalist myself, I get really offended and disappointed to see the industry I'm about to enter being raped of all dignity and integrity.  It makes me wonder what I can do to stop injustices like this.  I guess I've jumped to the conclusion that the situation is hopeless.  So yah, that basically sums up my feelings last night.  The world is going to end, and I feel there's nothing I can do to stop it.</p>
<p>So in the meantime, I think I'll go help Kyle with his table.  I think I'll go to class, be a good student, and the a diligent worker and go to Dial America.  I've got to earn that parking spot!  And it's not easy...</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, September 3rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="buffygloryicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Hello fellow Bloggers!  Here I be chillin' this Friday after my morning and mid-afternoon classes.  Things have been good today, nothing terribly stressful.  I got to talk to Justin and Joseph between classes about stuff.  It's nice hanging out in the SLC because I see more people then I do in the Lambda Office.  I think I really will be restricting my Lambda presense to my one hour a week.  I mean, there weren't even Cokes in there!  And, btw, I will be doing my weekly Buffy showing.  I fashioned the local speakers to transmit the "good news" of Buffy--which, in this case, was said sexy Vampire Slayer smacking vile goddess Glory around with an oversized hammer.  Sad ending though :'(</p>
<p>The highlight of this week (or should I say downlight?) would have to be the chronic tooth ache I've had.  Basically, since I haven't had my wisdom teeth out, I have nastiness back there that's eating away from one of the little bastards that has already grown in.  It started troubling me last Friday when I had a carrot.  The carrot upset my poor wisdom tooth and sent me into random bouts of pain all weekend and into this week.  I went to the Dental Clinic on Thursday and had them look at it.  Of course, they've suggested that I remove the little bastards, so that's on my short term agenda.  My wonderful mother solved my health insurance problem for me and got me the student package which covers some of the surgery.  Yah, to all those people that think I'm rich or whatever because I got a few lucky breaks over the summer, know that it's just not true.  That dental coverage you take for granted--<i>I have to actually pay for that stuff!</i>  It's not fun, but when faced with rotting teeth, you have to pay the bill.  What can I say.</p>
<p>So, more on my forthcoming time with my favorite gas Nitrous Oxide.  Oh, I'm not a drug addict, but I certainly love any time I get with anesthesia!  Everyone loves to be put under.  Well, besides that, I've been running around as always.  Still no word on the Red & Black, but I have an idea of 3 really good articles I'm going to start writing.  Election stuff has me really motivated, obviously.  Not in a partisan way though, which surprises me.  I really get nausious thinking of any political rhetoric--left or right.  It's all sickening, and it needs to be out of the news.  I think my only bias will be the truth.  Sounds simply enough, but let's hope I can do it.</p>
<p>Ok, it's time for class.  Make a comment before the page disappears :'(  It will be back though.  I promise.  Adios peeps.</p>
