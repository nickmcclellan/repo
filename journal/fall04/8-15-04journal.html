<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="halfdemoninuicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">It's started, right before my eyes, everything has been set in motion.  I was thinking...this year is unlike all the others.  In the past, I have had to endure an ambitious move before each Fall semester.  My first year, it was a momentous occasion.  Days after I moved into Russell, the realization that this was the first time in my life that I was alone was very powerful.  After I moved into Mary Lyndon, I met so many new people, and began the most exciting and life-changing semester since I've been in college.  Last year, when I moved into my house, I endured an exhaustive move all by myself from Marietta to Athens.  That night, I set up my bed among all the strewn pieces of furniture in my room, curled up with Matt, and slept like a baby.  Every year, it's been big and messy, and I've always been some place different.  This year, however, is different.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I worked on the website in my new room.  Since Marilia moved out in mid-June, my house has been in transition.  David moved in, and I helped him.  I got an influx of cups and plates, very much appreciated.  The living room has taken on several transformations.  I've moved into Milo's room.  Certainly, things have been different, but they've been different for a long time.  Now that Jennifer is living here, things are slowing down, but that by no means makes this August special.  Nothing happened yesterday, and even though I didn't expect anything  to happen, I'm still surprised.</p>
<p>Is it fall yet?  Maybe not in August, but some day soon.  But this week is important.  Thursday, classes start again.  Then Friday, they continue.  And then weeks and weeks of more classes, parties, people, and change.  All of it very important, and we all know how Fall has an effect on everyone.  Yesterday, I couldn't help thinking about how many new people arrived yesterday and how they will have such a profound impact on my last year here.  Whether they snicker when I ride by on my bike, hoot and holler while their drunk downtown, or if they're stopping by the Lambda Office to see what's going on.  They all arrived yesterday, and to them, these days are the most important  ever, but from my place here, at my house, I can't even see <i>why</i>.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's what I was thinking yesterday.  I also did a lot of nothing at all.  I worked alot on my webpage, fixed some bugs.  It looks really good, I'm happy how it turned out.  I miss the old theme, but it's nice to get a new one.  Lately, I've been thinking what I'll do with the webpage when I stop updating next May.  I want to recreate all the themes and have everyone who visits the front page to see randomly each theme.  It would be the same basic links, but the front page will reflect a past theme each time upon refresh.  That way, people will see every icon, every background.  I know it's possible, but I suppose I'll worry more about that next Spring.</p>
<p>Today, once I get moving, I'm going to take my bike to get fixed.  I'm going to be using it a bunch, I'm sure.  Come to think about it, I need to check on those free parking passes.  Can't trust Parking Services to just get off their ass and send you the passes like you'd asked of them.  I miss the depiction of Parking Services as being a bunch of monkeys in the Red & Black cartoons.  Those were always surprisingly accurate.  Anyways, I better get a move on.  More on my week later...and more new icons!  Hurray :-)

<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="ninelivesicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Yesterday, I made a bunch of icons :-)  I even splurged on an update to my DVD software that enables me to take snapshots of DVD movies and saved media on my computer (particularly, one video with a dancing carton of milk).  I used all my insane free time yesterday to make a very nice variety of charming little icons.  I will just have to leak them over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Matt got a job yesterday in downtown Atlanta.  I'm really happy for him, he was very encouraged by the news.  He wants to get out of Athens, and I suppose a weekly stint as a host downtown will be an excellent opportunity for him.  I'll miss him on the weekends, but if I'm not mistaken, I have to work as well.  This year's going to be really different.  I always feel this amazing encouragment at the beginning of a new semester.  This year, though, like everything else, it's different.  An A in Advanced Editing isn't going to score me a place on the Dean's List...it's going to score me a job!  It's going to score me a career, and that's really exciting and dizzying at the same time.  I probably shouldn't get into it now.  We'll see how things end up.</p>
<p>Today, I'm going to write a review for Spider-Man 2.  It's showing at 4, and I'm going to go alone, and with some paper and hopefully that skill I'm so sure is there, I'll write a nice review (nice in a sense that it's fun to read, not necessarily good for the movie).  I'm also going to do an article on the Simpsons in the next week or so.  I'm going to try to write alot more this semester so I start getting used to it.  Maybe an article a week :-/  I hope so, but I bet laziness will set in sometime.  Let's hope it doesn't.</p>
<p>Anyways, off to shower land.

<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="brandylj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I know, I know, another <i>god-damn BRANDY FACE!!!</i>  Unfortunatley, this could not be avoided.  Taco Mac just called me!  Yes, that's the Athens Taco Mac, and I'm going for an interview tomorrow at 5:30...how cool is that?!  I've been dreaming about having this job again for the longest time!  Serving in Athens...that would be too cool.  It would be stressful, but God, the money!  I'm going to Europe this summer for sure 8-)</p>
<p>In other news, Dial America let me leave early today.  It's the first time since I've worked outside of training when the sun was still up when I walked out of those doors.  I had a good day too, I had two friends sitting next to me, and we all were supposed to leave at 10 p.m., so I knew I wasn't going to be left all by myself.  Pretty cool, and I made decent sales (considering I got about 4 calls an hour).  Wow, so I might have to quit Dial America.  I wouldn't mind that at all.  It will be great to tell Clay to take this job and shove it.  I mean, they don't even offer paid breaks...and they hassle you for taking more than 10 minutes for any "personal time."  What the hell?!  Isn't something like that against the law?!</p>
<p>I saw Jerm today and heard a facinating story involving chocolate croissants and homeless people in New York.  I also got to tell him about my summer, which was sadly, not very impressive.  I'm happy though, it was by far the happiest summer I've had.  Maybe I didn't make alot of money.  Maybe I didn't go to Florida.  Maybe I didn't work at the Red & Black :-x  But I had a good time!  I was happy, and I'm in pretty good shape.</p>
<p>Last night was a headache...I couldn't figure out how to configure my Outlook 2002 for my Yahoo Pops, which enables me to recieve free POP access with my Yahoo Mail without paying for it.  Well, I have had it working on my Outlook Express all summer, but I wanted to take advantage of the increased security and functionality of the Office XP version of Outlook...well, fate had other designs for me.  It took a few hours, but I figured it out!  Now, things are looking better, thank God.  It's going to be nice taking this computer to campus.  I think I'll show Buffy episodes during my office shift...that's been my dream for so long!  People are going to be so impressed with my laptop, they'll be so jealous too...hehe</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm going to munch on more pasta marinara.  I can't wait to see the Pad tomorrow.  I hope we make out...</p>

<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="milkangelicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">So it's here?!  Classes!!  I don't have to wake up until like 10 tomorrow too, and that's only because I'm going to lunch with Paul.  I don't know why I felt like chiming in before bed, but I just had a fun night.  The big accomplishment was my successful teleconference with my cousin to help her reformat her hard drive.  It took a while, but we finally got to a command prompt and said those magic words...<B>FORMAT C:</B>  Yah, don't say that too often, or you might find yourself DELETED!</p>
<p>I also got lots of visits.  Gen came by to celebrate my Taco Mac interview w/ some Mike's Hard Lemonade (you know, like at Pride!) and we had some fudge.  It was good fudge.  Then Jennifer finally came by and took over my old room like I've expected she would have done weeks ago.  And THEN Marilia came over in a strange twist.  We talked about journalism and she took some more of her stuff away.  Yah, and then I finally talked to Matt.  Yah, so that was my night.  Fixing computer, doing laundry...missing Adult Swim.  Oh, the end of the Summer...it's hard to accept sometimes.</p>
<p>Well, I realize it's been over for a while.  I've been running around so much the last few days.  I went to get my bike fixed, wrote an article for Queer Magazine, went to work (new schedule), and saw some dirty vegetarian friends I've missed over the summer.  All in all, I'm sinking back into the new semester.  I guess I'll be over my head tomorrow.  I can't wait for my website class!  Like, I should already have an A.  Class is just a formality.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think I'll go to bed.  Adios.</p>
<hr class="midentry" size="1" align="center"><br>
<p>I'm bored...I got out of my first class just a little bit ago and I'm sitting at the SLC waiting for the next class.  I kinda wish the Lambda Office was open, just because I'd totally be taking advantage of that space if I could.  It's so private and secluded...and I know people I can talk to.  I totally could have been Administrative Director again, but I'm glad I'm not.  It was so cool having a key to that place and having it there so I could keep it open (and of course take advantage of the space for myself).  I had a pen crisis on my way to class, and I had to soldier on w/o the Lambda Office...one of many adjustments I'll probably need to make.  Mattie's working, Missy won't answer her phone, Genevieve is probably being some sort of responsible do-gooder.  I'm trying to be productive at the SLC...</p>
<p>Yah, the funny thing is my website class looks like it's going to be a breeze for me, go figure.  It's all "basic skills", and I'm good at those, but there are still a few I'm not familiar with.  Also, the midterm is--get this:  write a personal website about yourself.  Can I have my A now?!  Anyways, I think it will be informative, useful, and a cake walk all at the same time!</p>
<p>Is it just me, or does a cake walk make the image of eating cake off the floor where you walk incredibley tantalizing?  I don't think I've even been to a cake walk, so go figure.</p>
<p>This entry should make up for the entire summer of shitty entries I imagine :-[  I think I might go to the Red & Black tomorrow and talk about being a full time writer.  I have seen the request in the paper, and instead of putting it off, I'm going to head the word and seek information!  An article a week!  That's my goal.</p>
<p>Ok...and now for a new addition to the Blog:</p>

<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="subkagomeicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Urr...I don't know what I want to do now.  I can't track anyone down to go to lunch w/ me, and I know I should go talk to the Red & Black, but I'm hungry and I really don't want to walk around all day.  I'm at the SLC and there are too many people around me, and I really should be reading something or doing something, but I'm just playing around on my computer because it makes me feel important and detached from everything else that's going on in the room.  It's nice, but I still feel troubled.</p>
<p>My public affairs class looks like it's going to be a really difficult one for me, or at least I'll be doing alot of stuff I've never done before (some of which I've been dreading).  Yah, it will be good for me to do, and it actually encourages me to write for the Red & Black, so instead of it being optional, it's sort of mandatory, which just scares me.  Scares me and incites laziness...I have all this work to do!  All I want is a quiet Friday night now :-x  I still have Advanced Editing and Race, Gender, and the Media to go to.  One of these days, I'll stop writing so damn much, but I really don't have much of anything else to do...or I'm avoiding something.  I think it's time I go find out what that something is.</p>
<p>Later</p>

<p>I just found out that Antonio passed away.  This is really a let down, I really liked Antonio alot.  His funeral is tomorrow, and I'm going to go.  He was a very good guy and he was one of the more real reasons I felt that Lambda was still doing the right thing at UGA.  Seeing him come to the meetings and being welcomed in the Lambda Office made me feel good about what I was doing.  I'm very thankful for knowing him and am happy that he considered me one of his friends.  I don't think I can think of any reason why I wouldn't want to go to his funeral.  I just want to say Antonio was a good guy, and I will miss him.
