<p><img src="buffygloryicon.jpg" width="100" height="100" hspace="5" border="0" align="left">I sense a compelling interesting in me nowadays, so I'm pressured to make an entry. I'm going to say something soon, so don't doubt it. My not-so-mysterious depression will soon be revealed in all its nastiness, but for now, I'm preoccupied with ending the evil reign of Griswold. Sadly, he's the worst professor I've ever had. He's the nicest guy in the world, and I really do feel for him and everything he does, but it's not enough. He's just not a good professor, he makes public affairs about the most boring thing in the world, and I have a world of monotonous work to do before I can rid myself of him forever. That's <i>tomorrow</i>, or today, depending on how you look at it. The good news is I think I can do it, but I'm going to have to be un-depressed for about 24 hours to do it. Wish me luck.</p>
<p>Saturday night, I went to Missy's birthday gathering, which I wasn't looking forward to at all. I gave her several opportunities not to invite me because there are certain friends of her I know that despise me. Missy scoffed at the suggestion, and I don't think I could pass up celebrating her birthday, so I went along. I think it says alot when you can put aside any personal conflicts to celebrate someone's birthday or other special occasion. When Missy and I had it out earlier this semester, it wasn't until Genevieve's birthday came around that I finally had a chance to talk things out with Missy. In the end, I think the best thing I gave Gen was to deal with my issues with Missy, because I know she hates it when her friends are fighting.</p>
<p>Anyways, it was very nice.  I saw Noa, the Parrot Bay Girl.  I also had lots and lots of alcohol and got very dizzy.  Bar hopping wasn't nearly as horrible as I thought it would be.  When I went to bed, I was so dizzy, I'm surprised I didn't throw up.  I should not drink so much next time :-/<p>
<p>In other news, the bitch Genevieve dragged me to a 5K race on Saturday morning.  I had nightmares about it the night before, but it wasn't as bad as it turned out to be.  Don't get me wrong, it sucked, and I'm limping around because of it, but I finished it.  That's two 5K races!  That must be really good, right?  How many of you people have run in races?  Not many, surely.</p>
<p>Ok, I'm going to sleep again, bye.</p>

<div class="post">
<p><img src="milkangelicon.jpg" width="100" height="100" hspace="5" border="0" align="left">Well, I'm writing for the first time in, well, 2 years from Macromedia Dreamweaver! Hooray! Something that spell checks! Isn't that exciting? I must give mad props to my friend Jerm for hooking me up with this. It's pretty sweet.</p>
<p>Other than Dreamweaver related glee, I am with a headache now, which really sucks. I've had a really rough couple of days, and though today felt like the worst was over, there was still a good bunch of stuff to do today. For one, I interviewed Michelle Cohen, the new Sexual Health Educator in the Health Promotions Office. She was alot of fun. I also had the last Shakespeare class of the year. We watched a student adaptation of <em>The Merchant of Venice</em>. I thought it sucked very bad for many reasons. For one, the guy who's doing it seems really narcissistic. Also, there was a hardcore male gaze during the entire film. In once scene, the guy's on his way back to Venice, and the camera takes a nice close up of his crotch as he says, &quot;Let's go,&quot; and zips up the bag where the camera was stuffed. *Shutter*</p>
<p>I've been feeling a little better lately, I don't know why. I think I'm going to feel worse when I leave for Christmas. It's going to be nice, and all, but I wish things were better in a more permanent way instead of this day-to-day crap.</p>
<p>I think it's time to lay down :-(</p>
