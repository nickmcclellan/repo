<p><img border="0" src="brandypissedicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">Yah, so my day sucked royally.  Well, only in the official sense, but in reality, I really don't fell that shitty.  I just know things could have come out alot better.</p>
<p>For one, my car is acting up.  Well, not so much acting up as being a complete useless piece of metal.  You see, I noticed yesterday (possibly) that steam was coming out of my exhaust, but I couldn't tell for sure.  It seemed it had some issues starting, but I couldn't tell for sure.  Today, I confirmed my suspicions when the car would barely start, and when it did, an ominous cloud emerged.  Yah, I knew it was going to be an interesting day.</p>
<p>Well, school went alright.  I got my first paper back in English, and it was a straight C, which is expectable.  I've accepted that I bomb the first paper every semester.  I don't have a personal style, sadly, I just adapt to each teacher by taking some punches and learning some lessons.  My next paper will be much better.  In fact, I'm glad I picked the option of writing more papers during the semester.  This way, my grade is dispersed over 3 papers instead of 1 or 2.  It's a good thing, really.</p>
<p>In other news, I did an image map in my digital media class.  It's nice, and though I don't really feel image maps are what I'd like to do with my website, I might want to tweak with them here and there.  I also finally did something right with cascading style sheets.  They are all over my webpage, and they are going to make updating my page a breeze.  I can change everything by messing with one file.  Well, I probably won't mess much with it in the next few weeks, but it's nice to know I don't have to change the code in every webpage on my site for every update.  Yah, that gets annoying.  You can see image map fun <a href="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/imagemap.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thursday was rough, for all of us, I'm sure.  I'm hoping things will calm down soon.  Things are just changing so fast, I'm not sure I can keep up.  I don't even know if I want to...</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, September 22nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="starkittyicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I couldn't take it anymore!  I had to get my hair cut.  I don't really know what the feel of it is now, I guess that's up for the random bystanders to determine.  She used this crazy razor to thin out my hair, it felt really awful.  It was like my poor little hairsies were getting shreaded <i>and</i> she was yanking my hair out.  I survived though.  The hair feels better, but whether or not it looks better remains to be seen.</p>
<p>It's refreshing though now that I have a barbar that knows my name and knows what I want to do with my hair when I walk in the door.  That would have to be the best business referral I've gotten this year.  My stylist is very perky, and I have no problem talking to her about everything from Peanuts to Peaches.  Wow.  And we actually talked about that today :-)</p>
<p>Shit, don't you hate it when you come up with the perfect title to your Blog in the middle of the week and you're afraid you're going to piss people off that you titled it so early and you haven't given them amble opportunity to influence the flow of your week?  Well, what can I say people, <i>deal with it!</i></p>
<p>I'll postpone my rant on the uselessness of Blogs and my views on other peoples Blogs for this:  I considered skipping my Public Affairs class this morning because I hadn't written my article yet for this week.  I'm struggling with two excuses for this:  either I haven't had the time or I just have been too lazy.  Considering my mood last night, you would think the latter, but I must protest!  How I am supposed to conduct a good interview after 5 p.m.?  How can I gather content for an article when I'm busy from noon to 4:45?  I know, I know, there are 4 hours from 9 to 12, but <i>not</i> when your car won't do anything but blink <b>SPEND MONEY ON ME</b> and you ran around the day earlier like a chicken with his head cut off.  I mean, between the movies, papers, and 5 hours of class for me on Mondays, Tuesdays for me seem like a lobotomy day.  I'm just going to sit back, watch Teen Titans, and go to sleep!</p>
<p>Wednesdays aren't any better, and let's not start on Thursday!  Plus, Fridays are sacred, but let's not get into that now.  Anyways, I was going to say that I am feeling more and more like I've drifted into the useless subculture of Blogging, and I think I'm just an Internet polluter like the rest of them.  Sure, this Blog serves it's web-design purposes for me, but who really cares about my haircut and what I was thinking about class at 8 this morning?  Do you really care?  Why do people read this stuff?  Am I just so incredibly interesting that it warrents the waste of 3 minutes of someone's time?  Do people have some insane crush on me that they have to see everything they possibly can about me since they don't get as candid a picture when I'm walking down Baldwin Street?  I don't know why, but you select few still come, and it just blows my mind.  I just hope you get something out of this, because you're making me feel guilty and evil if you're not.</p>
<p>And yes, it's true.  I read Blogs.  I read Blogs, Live Journals, Xangas, whatever you want to call them.  I would characterize my reading of other people's personal lives as purely entertainment.  Some people are just drama queens.  Some people are just a rollar coaster of emotion.  And some people are just too interesting not to read about (but only a select few).  I do feel wierd about reading people's personal journals that I feel like I have something to gain from them (or that I feel they might have something to say about me).  It's very odd, about 2 years ago I would have jumped at the chance to read the Blogs of the people that I have access to now.  It's just that I don't.  I don't feel welcome, and it's these people's personal thoughts and reflections, and it's just going to make me feel disappointed that I'm not mentioned (or even if I am).</p>
<p>In closing, I think Blogs are great!  They are an excellent way to inform family and friends interested in the facets of you that they may not see every day.  I still maintain, however, that despite this capacity to inform, it's important for people to realize that Blogging is not a replacement to conversation, it's an excuse.  As far as the darker sides of Blogging (keeping tabs on people), I feel it's harmless if you're emotionally detached from the situation and you function soley as an entertained observer.  It's not acceptable, however, when your desire to know prevents your reasoning whether or not you should know.  Some things are meant to be read, and others are meant to be said to you.  Basically, I'm saying that it's important to know the difference.</p>
<p>So, did that make sense?  Maybe there wasn't a point to it, but I just wanted to defend my interest in Blogging and acknowledge its pettiness.  Also, if you think I read your Blog, Xange, or Live Journal, just ask me and I'll tell you.  It shouldn't be a secret, and it's good to know who's keeping up with you and the reasons why they do it.  It's been really great knowing who reads my Blog 8-)</p>
<p>Ok, food getting must commence!  Later jerks.</p>
