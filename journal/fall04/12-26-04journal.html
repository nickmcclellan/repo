<p><img name="Icon" src="kidinuicon.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Stay Kagome" align="left" hspace="5">Ohio is covered in snow. It's been like this since before I even got here. My flight on December 22nd was cancelled because of the very formidable snow storm that was bearing down on the Ohio Valley, so I had to wait a whole extra day before making it here. I am upset that I missed such an event. There was so much snow, and it all came down in one night. I wish I could have seen it.</p>
<p>Mike picked me up at the airport. He's been seeing my mom since the winter after she moved up here. He's a nice guy, I'm very happy that he makes my mom so happy. I know she wishes she could spend more time with me and Jennifer, but the sad truth is is that part of her life is coming to an end. She should find some new adventure. He seems like a nice guy, so I guess her time away from me and Jen is not empty. It means something.</p>
<p>Anyways, he had his &quot;coroner-mobile.&quot; Yup, complete with lights, sirens, and everything. At one point, on the highway, he got a call from his ex-wife, and he accidentally turned on the siren. I thought the cops were right on us! Well, turns out it was just us.</p>
<p>We pulled up to my mom's place and the dog came out, of course. I took my first step into the snowy wonderland, and you wouldn't believe it. It came up nearly to my knees, and it was so cold! Ok, so that's sort of believable, but what surprised me the most was how uncomfortable it was. The powder gets into my shoes and melts when I go into my Grandma's apartment so it's like walking through ice water. Oh, not to mention the fact that the temperature is below 0! I haven't been in a place like that barely ever. It made those frigid sub-30 nights in Georgia just alittle warmer than usual.</p>
<p>On the day before Christmas, my mom and I went shopping. It was a good time, but the distance from the make-shift parking lot and the front door was like an arctic hike. I felt like collapsing when I made it to Linens N' Things. Like I said, a makeshift parking lot: they had plowed mountains of snow all throughout the mall parking lot. People would line up their cars to the spots they thought best reflected the actual spots beneath the mixture of snow and salt. In most cases, people just did the best they could, and parked anywhere. I would have loved to see what it looked like up in the air. Like a corporate fractal&#8212;humans running to make their Christmas.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mom and I went to Meijer's, which is apparently the North's answer to Wal-Mart. It was sort of a cross pollination between Wal-Mart, Target, and Kroger. It had U-Scans (the exact same as Kroger), impressive signing and presentation, and enough space to best even our biggest Wal-Mart. They also had birds. I went to see the birds, and I thought about them a while. I held my cell phone alot, too. I guess I expected it would start singing too.</p>
<p>Before I left Thursday, I was depressed, but this time for several reasons. That gross snow that had now become multi-colored from the multitude of salt and dirt that everyone's cars had spread around had grown on me. It was melting, at this time, and I began to see green blades of grass pop up all over the place. It seems my vacation was coming to an end, and I had to go home.</p>
<p>My mom dropped me off at Dayton Airport. I took my rather large bags to the Delta attendant (I tipped him this time) and he told me I had to follow them inside to answer some questions. Suddenly, the pairing knives my mother gave me came to mind, but I suppose they would only take issue with that if they were in my carry-on luggage. I thought I could give my mother a longer hug and goodbye, but I had to make it quick, because Mr. Delta had work to do. I hugged her, kissed her, and told her that I loved her, and I thanked her for letting me come up to see her. At home, I feel so worthless sometimes. I feel a little piece of home when I'm with my mother, so in that respect, the vacation was almost a complete success. I almost forgot what I was running from.</p>
<p>I walked slowly to the security checkpoint, I didn't want to let the moment go that quickly. I messaged my mother, I wanted her to know.</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Blue Sky</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img src="halfdemoninuicon.jpg" width="100" height="100" hspace="5" align="left">I came home on the news that Blue Sky had closed. I don't know, but I wanted to talk about what that place met to me. It was the place I met Greg. Yah, Greg, remember him? He was my first friend at UGA, and we <em>actually</em> met at Russell Hall, but we went for a walk and settled at Blue Sky to talk. I remember him saying that he saw that place as being one of the many places he'd imagine gay people would flock to. I'm not sure if that proved true, but I certainly went there, but it wasn't because I was gay.</p>
<p>I mean, Danny Roberts, when he was on the Real World, always wore the shirt. I just noted that when I saw the series, but when I got the UGA pamphlet in the mail, I say the Blue Sky logo and I put 2 and 2 together&#8212;it's an Athens coffee shop! It was THE Athens coffee shop, but it wasn't until my sophomore year that I really started to frequent the place. I would go there to study, to write, to pass away the time. There were some nights, when I couldn't stand Choe or Luke, or just my room, that I needed to get out and go someplace to study and be social. That turned out the be the place.</p>
<p>Missy would go sometimes, but I don't think she ever got why anyone would study in such a noisy, public place. I think it had something to do with the fact that, in a place like that, you felt important. You felt like you were apart of something. Maybe it was the art on the walls, or the fascinating clientele, but something kept people coming to that place.</p>
<p>Though I tried to keep the tradition up in my Junior year when I moved out to Highland, something just didn't sink up. I mean, I had this confrontation in there involving alcohol or something (the purchase of alcohol for an underage tailgate actually), and I guess that left a sour taste in my mouth. It was like someone monopolized on the image, and it became sullied. I stopped going there regularly.</p>
<p>I went there once this year. I walked in the door, I had heard they wanted to be a restaurant. When I walked by the brick wall that was once adorned with art, and by the tables once seated with the most eclectic of college students, I felt like an outsider. It was like Blue Sky sold its soul. It was over for me then, so I scurried out, and I suppose I'll never go there again.</p>
<p>I think there's alittle piece of Blue Sky in all of us. We all left, for one reason or another, and we took with us all the reasons that we assembled there. It's sad we can't have that again. I don't think Hot Corner, Jittery Joe's, or even Starbucks can recreate the feeling of Blue Sky for me. It wasn't about the coffee or the pastries. It wasn't about the bricks of Rice Krispie Treats.</p>
<p>It was just time. And it's over now.
