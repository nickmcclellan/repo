<img border="0" src="spnick.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Urr...I was mistaken for a high schooler again today >:o  The last time that happened was at my sister's Senior Assembly at McEachern, and one of the teachers tried to usher me up with the freshman...THE FRESHMAN!  I'm sorry, certainly I look older than a high school freshman.  Well, today, I don't know if it was an issue of my age or not, but more my mode of transportation.  Maybe I'm the only guy in Athens that goes to my polling place on my bicycle.  Can't help it...</p>
<p>So, I voted.  It always feels so nice to vote.  Anyone who doesn't vote is an idiot and really should be shot in the head.  Then again...I imagine alot of people that do vote are idiots, so maybe we should shot half the people who vote in the head and then another half of the people who don't vote, and hopefully that will motivate people who don't vote to vote and not be idiots...or maybe we'll all go to jail for shotting people in the head :-$  Well, my train of thought leads me to SR595, which is a piece of crap and should be STOPPED.  I don't care how hopeless it seems, when pigheaded Christian Nazi's threaten to amend your constitution to put blatant discrimination in it, you need to step up and make your voice heard.  I'm going to <i>so</i> vote Brian Kemp out of office and e-mail him after it happens to let him know why I voted the way I did.  Assholes...</p>
<p>Um, so did anyone like what I did last week?  No one really has said anything, but people I showed it to really thought it was something else.  It was a challenge not to open up my journal and start to write in it.  It got kind of annoying having to write rhyming poems for seven days too...but I really like taking this Blog to creative heights like that.  I think that's more important than bitching and moaning any day.  Next week, I'm doing the third installment of Spring Break...this year, Surprise!  Surprise!  Spring Break 2004.  Hoping there will be more pictures...and I should write less :-x</p>
<p>Ok...it's pretty outside, I'm going to go hunt down my lesbian and go running around Athens...</p>
<p>BREAKING NEWS!  There was water on Mars!  That's so exciting, I think I'll go for a swim too :-p

<p>Believe it or not, I was mistaken for being in high school AGAIN today!  I don't know what it is about me this week, but apparently I look eighteen years of age.  Some kid (probably skipping school) asked me something about why I was riding my bike away from school today.  I'm like...yah, like I'd be making my great escape from High School.  I thought I graduated out of these things?</p>
<p>One more test!  Also term paper prep!  Then I'm going to get intimate with my bottle of Vanilla Bacardi.  I want to go to a party, get drunk and go dancing--I don't know, I just want to do something that doesn't involve me procrastinating.  I promise, I won't procrastinate a good buzz.</p>
<p>There was something else that I wanted to write about...but God help me, I can't remember.  You'll have to fetch it out of me later, I suppose.  For now, I think I'll take an eight hour nap.  Later!

<img border="0" src="homsar.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Yah, midterms are over!  I think I did a good job on the Modern Drama midterm...it was very easy, though I know I got one of the indentifications incorrect :-/  Sucky.  In other news, I think I will have a fairly good term paper for Fink when we return.  I just need to get over some mild phone phobia calling some journalism big wigs.  I suck at interviewing too...maybe I'll brush up.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that I haven't talked about Spring Break AT ALL!  Wow, well, I don't know why I've neglected this, but this year, Missy and I are returning to sunny Florida.  We won't be going to Destin, sadly, we'll be going to KEY WEST!  I'm really excited about the trip, I haven't been to Key West since I was a little kid.  We're also staying two nights in Orlando and the spending the last night in Miami.  I'm going with Missy, Matt, Alex (you know, the little one), and his friend Jessica.  I'm hoping that at some point we can stop off in Boca Raton, maybe to eat at Wilt Chamberlin's.  I grew up in South Florida, I'm looking forward to being around my roots (yup, those good ol' bleech blond Floridean roots 8-)</p>
<p>Tonight, I'm going to celebrate the upcoming nine days of no school with some of my Vanilla Bacardi and my closest friends (some friends I'd like to get a bit closer to ;-)  I haven't been to Boneshakers in FOREVER, it will be nice to get some dancin' on and to see what the local homosexuals have been up to.  Isn't it annoying when people begin to couple?  Uck, it just sickens me, they get all optimistic and inflated, it makes me shutter.  TEN MONTHS!  I have ten months on all you guys!  That's right, ten months with Matt today.  You can send me chocolates...</p>
<p>OMG, look at THIS!</p>

<p>Um, that seems to be very appropriate.  It will be interesting to see how Missy and I interact over the break.  Last year, I had her pressed up against a wall on Bourbon Street.  The year before, she was in tears outside Club La Vela.  This year, perhaps I'll have her naked on a sand bar--who knows!  That girl's something else.</p>
<p>So...I guess I may make an entry tomorrow.  I have been Blog-lite lately, with the business and all (wow, the -ness version of busy is business...who knew).  Now that there's not business, let's have fun!</p>
<p>If I don't Blog on Saturday, expect a note on Sunday or Monday about my Spring Break plans and when you can expect my entry for Spring Break 2004.  For now, I'm going to continue taking online quizzes with Laura...oh yah!
