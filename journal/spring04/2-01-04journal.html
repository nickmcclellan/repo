<img border="0" src="evilwillow.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Reverse sorority date night tonight.  You know, the night when I take Laura out and she doesn't have to drag my cheap ass around.  Yah, that's what I'm doing.</p>
<p>Hey, how about the non-Blogging for almost half the week?  I'm proud.  Thankfully, I never really got that Blog tingle.  It's nice being silent.  I really should not do that this week though, it's an important week.  Saturday is the party.  We have hopefully hoards of people coming, lots of alcohol.  I'm in charge of tequila and tequila accesories.  I am thinking we'll be body shooting.  I've never had tequila, and I don't really want any :-x  If you haven't been invited to the party, I'm sure it was not intentional (or perhaps it was, and you probably know why).</p>
<p>I guess, to comment on recent world happenings (more accurately, entertainment happenings), I fell very sorry for Janet Jackson and what happened to her at the Super Bowl.  I imagine having her bra ripped off in front of millions of people was not something she enjoyed, it was probably something very humiliating.  I don't think I know anyone who would agree to be showcased naked in front of that many people just to cause gossip talk.  It's unfortunate that what was probably a valuable opportunity for her to get out into the public spotlight once again has turned into a nightmare.  It's a shame.</p>
<p>So, I transmitted nearly 2 gigabytes of my mp3's across my apartment the other night.  I think that's pretty cool, it was my present for Marilia, to repopulate her computer with pirated music so she can have a welcomed distraction from studying.  Go me.</p>
<p>I should probably get sexy for Laura.  Do girls give it up on the first date?  I guess since she's in a sorority, I'm riding on a sure shot.  Horray!

<img border="0" src="shirlface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Wow, so after my busy Thursday, I entered into a coma last night, even before I was able to make some mac & cheese.  I was on campus all day yesterday, being very studious.  After going decoration shopping for the dance, I was through.  I didn't even have time to talk to Matt, and I wanted to, I was just way too tired.  I woke up at 4 in the morning and just dozed off again.  I haven't slept that much in a while...</p>
<p>Party tomorrow, don't forget.  I'm going to have to flyer for the Dance today instead of yesterday, which I had intended to do.  I hate flyering.  I'm going to be hanging out with Matt tonight.  I want to take him someplace that involves dessert, but I just don't know if I'm capable, being carless and all.  Maybe this warrents an attempt to drive the shit mobile :-x</p>
<p>We'll see.  Anyways, I'm hungry.  I'm without anything very appetizing here.  Maybe I'll make pasta for Matt tonight.  That would be nice :-D</p>
<p align="center"><i>"Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue<br>
Thought I heard you talking softly...<br>
I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio<br>
Still I can't escape the ghost of you<br>
What has happened to it all?<br>
Crazy, some'd say<br>
Where is the life that I recognize?<br>
Gone away..."<br>

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, February 7th...PARTY TONIGHT!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>The party is hours away, and I'm so excited!  I'm all stocked with tequila and beer, and I finally found those limes I squirreled away!  I wish I could go over to Missy's and watch her get ready.  I've gone from worrying that no one will show up to worrying that too many people will show up and the cops really will come and break us all up.  At least I'm not legally responsible, so cheers!</p>
<p>Not sure where I'll end up tonight.  I hope it's a nice bed, either at Missy's, Sonya's, or my place.  I guess it won't really matter.  I'm very psyched and kind of nervous.  Am I a good party host?  Can I do this?  What's going to happen...</p>
<p align="center"><i>"Wake up.  Don't fear.<br>
I want to.  Love you.<br>
Yeah (doll of pain)<br>
I let you get to me<br>
Yeah, yeah..."<br>
