<img border="0" src="shirlface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I must apologize.  In all the rush of getting a new car, reconnecting to people I haven't seen in months, I've been seriously neglecting the Blog.  I suppose it's time to sit down and tell the stories <i>behind</i> the Brandy faces.  Let's start with that.  What exactly is the Brandy face?</p>
<p>Well, we all know <a href="../../friends/brandy.html" target="_blank">Brandy</a>.  Adorable dog, tragically taken before her time (she should have died at 13, damnit!)  You see, the pacifier photo of Brandy is just so precious, in the grand scheme of journal icons, it's like digital happiness to me.  My original staple of several icon pictures included a few garbage regulars, some Making Fiends classics, and various personal favorites, one of which being my beloved picture of my puppy Brandy.</p>
<p>In response to these recent weeks of repeated digital happiness, I'll be introducing a new version of Brandy face.  For those who have frequented my screenname over the past few years, it's an oldie, but a goodie.  Hope you'll enjoy.</p>
<p>Anyways, just thought I'd share an Ohio story.  Not sure if it's common knowledge, but my mother works at the tissue bank in Dayton.  The tissue bank is where they bring all you generous organ donors after you die so they can cut you up and harvest your organs, veins, and bones for science.  So Saturday night, Mike is looking for a notary so I can have the Prix's title signed over to me and we end up at the Dayton morgue.  I was actually in the garage that the ambulances must bring the dead bodies!  On the way out, my mom even opened the fridge door for a moment to give me a peak at some of the fresher specimens.  FREAKY!</p>
<p>The most intriguing exchange came about when Mike took us to his office so he could notarize the title.  Some guy was there, apprantly relegated that evening to manning the morgue.  Mom asked him about this guy they brought in last week.  "He looked like a wild man!" she exclaimed, as he touted some interesting tattoes.  Mister morgue duty agreed, saying they found him some barn in the middle of no-where where he hung himself.</p>
<p>"We found one hand in the noose--it looked like he was having second thoughts," he said.</p>
<p>Well, I guess it was too late :-x</p>
<p>In other news, I'm going to be doing some volunteer editing for some magazine called <i>Queer</i>.  Good news!  Hopefully I can further figure out what the hell I want to do with this life.  I also cleaned my kitchen.  It looks really good.  <i>Queer as Folk</i> was half-way decent tonight, though sadly predictable.  Tomorrow I'm going to pick up Missy at the airport.  Better rest up for the drive.</p>
<p>I'll be seeing you...

<img border="0" src="evilwillow.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I got Buffy Season Six!  Oh yah :-D  I've already watched my favorite episode of the bunch--that being Tabula Rasa.  You know the one.  That silly Willow wants Buffy and Tara to forget heaven and her own transgressions, respectively, and she takes the magics just a <i>little</i> too far.  It's a good one.</p>
<p>In other news, I'm tired.  And alone :-(  I want to watch my Buffy Season Six with Matt!  He's not coming over tonight though, sadness.  I should probably go to bed to rest up for my exhaustive 5 hour training session at Dial America tomorrow.  My trainer reminds me of Leo from Call for Help.  He's very nice and very enthusiastic about Bank of America.  I think it's going to be an easy job.  Looks like when you get those credit card offers in the mail from Bank of America, I'm the dorkus on the other line that helps to enter your application.  Dial America get all invasiony on your privacy though, they listen to one of your calls so they can give you "pointers."  I just hope it's not when I go nuts on that old lady in Kiukuk (Fink knows the one).  Bitch is goin' down!</p>
<p>I went out with my sister on Monday and she bought a digital camera.  I want a digital camera!  :-(  She got a nice one.  Looks like I'll have to look at something $300 plus too.  I mean, I can buy a camera whenever I want to, but I'd have to do it on credit.  I don't like too many things hanging over my head like that, I think I'll have to wait.  Waiting sucks, I want it now :'(</p>
<p>Uh...enough of this.  Something interesting is bound to happen sometime soon!</p>

<p>I'm sorry, it's late, but there was something I came across today that I wanted to share with everyone.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when I browse my My Yahoo page, I look through the "Oddly Enough" section and read whatever strange stories there are in the world.  The most popular story at the moment for some reason really struck me.  It's odd, that goes without saying, but I just felt like it was unusually absurd and perversly <i>poetic</i>.</p>
<p>If you're inclinded to agree (and you won't), let me know.</p>
<div align="center">

<tr>
<td align="left"><i><p>A 50-year-old Zambian man has hanged himself after his wife found him having sex with a hen, police said Friday.</p>
<p>The woman caught him in the act when she rushed into their house to investigate a noise.</p>
<p>"He attempted to kill her but she managed to escape," a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>The man from the town of Chongwe, about 50 km (30 miles) east of Lusaka, killed himself after being admonished by other villagers.</p>
<p>The hen was slaughtered after the incident.</p></i></td></tr></table></div><br>
<p>I'll try to chime in with something before I go to work.  If not, I guess I'll see you next week.  Goodnight.
