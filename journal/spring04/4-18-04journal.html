<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, April 18th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Hey, I'm in the SLC with my friend Genevieve.  It's fun.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, April 21st</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="brandylj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>You'll have to excuse Sunday's post.  I was working at the SLC and I decided to show Gen how I publish my Blog.  She probably blocked the whole experience out of her mind, but I have recorded it anyways.</p>
<p>Well, besides thinking about Blogging earlier today, I was inspired from an interview with Wil Wheaton to write in my Blog.  Apparently, a shitload of people read his Blog all the time, and that's cool.  I don't think nearly as many people read this, but I'd bet I'd be surprised by the actual number.  Anyways, Blogging is cool, and I shouldn't be discouraged.  Besides, my Blog looks to be the coolest anyone has ever seen, and I don't need some lame open source Blog system to do that.</p>
<p>So, we get a Brandy face today because I got an A- on the paper I wrote Sunday.  Yah, I guess I did a good job.  Fink is a very sympathetic grader.  In other news, my Modern Drama class was cancelled twice this week, so I got to do other non-productive things.  I also returned some pants I bought Saturday for Laura's formal (so very wrong...)  So yah, today was a good day :-)</p>
<p>I just bought <i>Look Who's Talking Too</i>, so expect a public viewing in the future.  Um, so yah, I'm bored of this now.  I'll Blog you later.  Adios.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Friday, April 23rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="vendetta2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>So yah, a Civic.  Would I look good in a Civic?  What do you think?  I mean, come one...it's not a shitmobile, right?!  Well, not yet.  I suppose if I go from here to San Francisco a few times, we can fix that.  I want a Hybrid though...wouldn't that be cool?  For some reason, when asked what car I'd like, I feel like just getting a Civic like Matt and Gen is unappealing.  I don't know why, it beats the bloody hell out of riding my bike to get around, but for some reason, I feel like my car should represent a distinct part of my personality.  A Civic just seems like everyone has one.  Well, I should count my blessings.  Honestly, something with keyless entry, a CD player, and a power window on AT LEAST the driver's side would be more luxury than Mazda 626 LX ever gave me.  God-damn piece of shit (sorry, but it's true).</p>
<p>This weekend, I should be making progress on all 3 of my English essays.  They are all very important, and I <i>plan</i> to wake up tomorrow and head to the SLC to work on my creative writing portfolio.  That paper should be a no brainer.  I really need to delve deep into my two upper level English courses though.  Though stuff man.  It would be dreamy to have drafts of both by Sunday night, but we'll see.  When this is all over...God, best summer ever?  Is that a posibility?</p>
<p>Haven't really given much thought to it.  It would be nice if Spring and Fall semester flowed into eachother, but I guess that's not possible.  I'm pretty sure I can get me a job.  Once I have the car and I've paid for all my rent, I'd like to buy myself a laptop.  That's the goal, if I don't have to take classes, I'd like to save my money for a new computer.  Yah, maybe do something newspaperish too, I sort of need a long-term job after college.  Yah, got to get the ball rolling on that some time soon...:-x</p>

<p>Oh, yah, and a new <a href="http://www.makingfiends.com/fiend08.htm" target="_blank">Making Fiends</a>!  This one is much better than episode 7, though I don't know if it's the best of the bunch...I enjoyed it.  I mean, I love seeing what Amy comes up with, she's very talented.  I want to learn how to do flash like she and other animators do.  I'm sort of looking into refining my HTML abilities, learning some Java, and just all around being a bit more versatile website-wise.  I've probably mentioned this more than once, but my goal is, after I graduate, to leave "Thursday" (the website) the way it is--a dedication to four years at UGA--and then going onto some new web community.  Well, I guess "Thursday" is just a place where I learn all these neat little website things...I suppose my <i>real</i> website will be alot better.</p>
<p>Anyways, Mattie's here, got to go, bye bye!
