<i>At last, my car, my own reclining seat<br>
A place to toss receipts next to my feet<br>
My car, a way to walk a thousand miles<br>
My bike, exiled to where my childhood piles<br>
<br>
It starts, I tingle, leaving all my toys<br>
A pause--oh no!  What is that little noise?<br>
I drive, ignore the mild transmission rumble<br>
A turn, no fears the wheels may start to tumble<br>
<br>
The beginning, my sister eats her Subway meal<br>
Pressing the gas, I wake the Shitmobile.</i></div></td></tr></table></div>

<i>I never thought my car was something odd<br>
Colored grey and bore and more on dented doors<br>
Never fooled by citrus scent facade<br>
A mildew musk, like nothing known before<br>
<br>
Those Summer days, romantic walks in Hell<br>
My handheld fan, a freon-less escape<br>
Like demon breath upon my sweaty nape<br>
Trapped inside this four-door prison cell<br>
<br>
Back and forth, to work and home I go<br>
While slowly melting engine heart below...</i></div></td></tr></table></div>

<i>My Junior year, Odometer did grow<br>
Ignorant to problems from below<br>
Bubblin' up from gaskets, tanks, and pipes<br>
Whilst I enduring petty sibling fights<br>
<br>
At last, it came.  The car did stop<br>
Motor melting with a "Pop!"<br>
And with steam rising in the air<br>
Twas likely months until repair<br>
<br>
Summer came and I was bumming rides<br>
Spending thousands fixing my car's insides...</i></div></td></tr></table></div>

<i>At last my car returned to me anew<br>
Though it cost alot, things didn't seem askew<br>
If only I knew...<br>
<br>
The transmission rumbled until it stopped<br>
And then it dropped<br>
<br>
After double-cheese, fries and a coke<br>
The battery broke<br>
<br>
There was that time, on route to work<br>
The alternator went beserk<br>
<br>
Confused and angry, I asked for aid<br>
Discouraged from costs that I had paid<br>
My dad refused to assist my cause<br>
Knowing there were too many flaws<br>
<br>
So off I went, time bomb ticking away<br>
Helpless to stop that fateful day...</i></div></td></tr></table></div>

<i>Hell hath no fury like Shitmobile scorned<br>
Taking the first step, heeding all that was warned<br>
Hundreds I spent to prevent its demise<br>
Halting the problems that were sure to arise<br>
<br>
So after it all, I went for a ride<br>
Summer sun beaming, confident in stride<br>
My alternator decided to take a short break<br>
In perfect time for my little mistake<br>
<br>
Turns out it's not healthy for black to touch red<br>
The battery sparked and my heart filled with dread<br>
It's inards decided to sizzle and bake<br>
Taking more money that I'd have to make<br>
<br>
That summer was hard, I worked overnight<br>
My Shitmobile worked, now college in sight<br>
Packing my things, I proceeded to go<br>
Though more and more problems started to show...</i></div></td></tr></table></div>

<i>My years at college, the best of my life<br>
Though sporadicly fraught with Shitmobile strife<br>
Through years having suffered electrical woe<br>
Now finally arrived at my personal low<br>
<br>
Listening to music, I saw with a fright<br>
My CD player stop and turn out the light<br>
I had to slow down and take caution at first<br>
Realizing, sadly, my car had been cursed!<br>
<br>
For months I could not go faster than thirty<br>
Without my music flying off like a birdie<br>
Angry and bitter, I had reached the end<br>
Refusing to send the car back on the mend...</i></div></td></tr></table></div>

<br>
<i>Oh Shitmobile!  The time has come to leave<br>
My bitch, so tempting and dainty like Eve<br>
You've taken me places that I've never been<br>
Though cursing me like original sin<br>
<br>
While comfort was never a strong suit for you<br>
You've comforted me like I never knew<br>
When computers and phones and other things broke<br>
I always thought you'd be the next to choak<br>
<br>
Certainly you've busted a hubcap or two<br>
But you were always there when I needed you<br>
To work, to home, to places unknown<br>
Buckled in tight on my grey-seated throne<br>
<br>
But now you've gone to darken another's day<br>
While I, relinquished to peddle my bike away<br>
I think of memories, cherished and sweet<br>
Memories of which I'll NEVER repeat<br>
<br>
I curse you and your smelly ass<br>
Burn in hell, you piece of shit!</i></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>Well, hopefully you all liked that.  I would LOVE to know how everyone responded.  I know it was all kind of sudden, but with the loss of my car, I knew I wanted to do that, I just didn't expect I'd be losing it so soon.  Hopefully the story culminated the way everyone hoped...in unrhymed couplet fun!</p>
<p>For now, check out the brand new <a href="../../friends/shitmobile.html">Shitmobile Page</a>.  Sure, it's kind of long, but it's a fitting send off to my car of six years.  Hopefully everyone will like.  It's nice to know the piece of shit in my driveway has been compacted into easy webpage accessible size.  Neato!</p>
<p>So, look for good ol' Blogs to return on Leap Year Week!  See you then :-)
