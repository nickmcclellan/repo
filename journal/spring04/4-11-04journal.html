<img border="0" src="dearest.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I just got off the phone with Matt and I started to reminisce.  It was about a year ago that my crazy head started to fall in love with Matt.  Our anniversary is on May 5th, and, God, I never thought that day would ever come for he and I.  I can be such a selfish, vain little prick sometimes, I thought for sure Fall semester would have me with someone else, but that never happened.  I felt for sure that something would come between us.  I don't know what it is, I guess I'm too lazy not to love the guy, but that's how it is.  He's just too amazing not to fall in love with.  He's my man and I'm sticking to him.</p>
<p>I remember thinking, "Buffy Season 5 comes out in December..." and I had been watching Buffy with Matt all summer.  I was kind of bummed, I thought, "Hmmm, since we'll <i>obviously</i> be breaking up for some reason between now and then, I'll never get to watch my favorite season with him..."  It was so nice to be wrong.  I got to see every episode with him, and he enjoyed all of it.  I'm an obsessive freak a whole lot of the time, but he loves me and he accepts it.  What a prince!  I'm a little bit more optimistic about seeing Season 6 with him--that comes out in May.  Oh, those early days...Matt coming over, we watch 3 or 4 episodes of Buffy, then go to sleep.  A few weeks ago we were watching Buffy and he spilt Pepsi all over my class notebooks.  He's so cute :-p</p>
<p>Matt is such an important part of my life.  He's sort of drilled a little hole in me and he won't leave, it's really disgusting--like termites or something!  He is always there for me when I need him.  He comes to see me and supports me and loves me and holds me above like no one else.  I don't always feel that sometimes, but I know it.  I know that I love him too.  I guess I just wanted to say that.</p>
<p>I made him a Kagome icon :-)

<p>Oh, I've had the longest couple of days.  I really should be working on my term paper on Monday, but I'm so exhausted.  I think I'm going to turn in early, I have to see my professor at 8 a.m. to beg him to let my paper count more than my tests in the course.  I just don't know how 90% of the course can be based on recalling indentifications.  Uh, and I really hate talking to professors.</p>
<p>Anyways, I wanted to come up with something.  Lately I've been neglecting the Blog, but it's only because I have more important things to do.  I don't know...I'll try to add something tomorrow.  Very busy weekend ahead.  I'm going to end this semester on top if it kills me.

<img border="0" src="cupofcoffee.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Yah, so I did sorority formal *tonight* (wink wink).  That was alot more fun that I thought it would be.  First of all, I got over any "wardrobe malfunctions" that I suffered from last year.  It's nice owning a pair of black socks even though it's probably temporary.  We went to Mallory's downtown first.  That place sucked, the chicken was way too greasy, and it gave me the hiccups.  I coordinating with Laura very well.  I wore my ever-lovable Guess shirt with some black slacks and a really sharp tie.  It beat the hell out of the suit I'm always wearing.  After dinner, we went to the Firehall at the Classic Center for the formal.  That was nice, filled with pretty girls :-D</p>
<p>Laura had a nice time, stressing about certain things.  A change in your life's direction is kind of hard to explain to random strangers, who really may not have cared anyways, but that doesn't stop them from bringing it up to harp on your buzz.  I kind of experienced a microcosm of this when I touted that I'd be going to UGA at Oxford.  Well, that never happened, and it's disappointing, but sometimes things don't work out the way you'd like.  I'd like to thank the Mazda for making that happen...forever a drain on my savings and dreams >:o</p>
<p>So, when it was time to go, I drove my sexy sorority girl home and hopped over to Gen's.  We went to Boneshakers and played some pool.  We actually played on a team against some guy, but he really kicked our ass.  Well, I guess you could say I bounced the q-ball more than I sank any of our solid colored ones.  I'm a disappointment, surely.  But we got to see some people we haven't seen in a while.  Also, a whole lot of people we haven't seen ever.  To repay me for my selfless paying-of-her-cover-charge, Gen bought me some ice cream sandwiches.  I'm going to try to avoid those as long as I possibly can =-0 (yah right).</p>
<p>Well, after several dreams (one about my shitty computer and another about my mother coming to see me), I'm awake again, worried about my term paper.  I'm going to the SLC all day to work on it.  Hopefully, I'll walk out of there with a good piece of work.  An A?  Unlikely.
