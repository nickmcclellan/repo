<img border="0" src="lilyface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>You know I had to chime in with <i>something</i> before the end of the week.  Basically, I've been running around on my last week of training, tracking down my financial aid, and preparing for my mother's visit, which has been very choppy so far.  I'm having a good time, I like having my mother here.  The sibling squabling needs to go, God, please.  Anyways, the cat's here too, hence the Lily face, so that's been nice.  Don't tell Jeani.</p>
<p>So it's official, I'm moving out of my room into Milo's room.  Yah yah, but Missy WON'T be fucking in that room anytime soon.  That's gonna be for me only :-p  Yah, uh huh.  Well, yah, it's smaller, I'm losing the precious bathroom, but I'm getting more money a month out of my loan, and money's becoming an issue, especially once I start paying those loans back.  I think I'll be pretty good this year though, I think having my desk by the back window will be very nice.  I just hope everything fits.  Uh, it's stressful, everything's stressful!  I just want to have this dealt with.  Uh...</p>
<p>I figured out my schedule this week.  I have the final tally in at about exactly 30 hours until I have two degrees and one minor.  Pretty nifty, huh?  I did a pretty good job, one more year, and I've got this sucka in the bag!  My fall semester going to be heavy into journalism, and spring's gonna be sprinkled with English goodness and Spanish surprise.  Yah for graduating!  I have designs on heading to Europe next summer to see Nicole and, well, about everything else.  I think I can make it happen.</p>
<p>So yah, in other website news, the update will be up and running the week after next.  I'm through with the new front page, I just need to make the new Blog page and I'll be about set.  Finding a good centerpiece picture for the page is mostly what I'm stressing about.  This last update's rainy day cloud is just too cool, I wish I didn't have to change that.  Ah well, here's to originality!</p>
<p>To Helen in the morning!  Adios folks.
