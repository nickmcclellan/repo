<img border="0" src="shirlface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Uh, I think it's annoying how short this summer is.  I know alot of people must be miserable waiting for the Fall semester to start, but I'm actually quite happy.  This is the summer of sleeping, certainly.  Also, I seem to be very reclusive and not interested in doing too many things.  I will be more proactive in--how long is it?  Wow, a little over a month.  You know what that means.  I have to make a new website theme >:o</p>
<p>I put all my effort into the 2001 journal, I feel tapped out.  I'll think of something, because once I get in the zone, I'm all about changing the theme.  I don't have a good idea of what I want.  This last year, it was Black and White.  Before, it was lame and lame.  Yah, and before that, it was just garbage!  Maybe a mahogany color?  Like the new garbage site?  Yah, I bite, so watch out!</p>
<p>In other news, I'm an asshole!  I watched <i>Almost Famous</i> with Matt and Gen last night at her place.  I thought I had seen the movie before, and I had--my sophomore year, Gen and Missy came down to my room and we watched it.  Apparently I was too wrapped up in my <i>computer</i> that I didn't pay much attention to the plot.  I felt like an idiot, I mean, it was a good movie.  I saw Kate Hudson's boobies.  That's nice.  Also, mad props to Gen.  I love getting calls to go to Shoal Creek to get my Stevie B's pizza and my late night movie.  I love Gen!</p>
<p>Ok, I've already been in the fat burning zone today, so I'm going to the veg zone.  Cheers!

<i>Asked you a question<br>
I didn't need you to reply<br>
Is it gettin' heavy?<br>
But they'll realize<br>
Is it gettin' heavy?<br>
Well I thought it was already as heavy<br>
As can be<br>
<br>
Is it overwhelming<br>
To use a crane to crush a fly?<br>
It's a good time for Superman<br>
To lift the sun into the sky<br>
<br>
'Cause it's gettin' heavy<br>
Well I thought it was already as heavy<br>
As can be<br>
<br>
Tell everybody<br>
Waitin' for Superman<br>
That they should try to hold on<br>
Best they can<br>
He hasn't dropped them<br>
Forgot them<br>
Or anything<br>
It's just too heavy for Superman to lift<br>
