<img border="0" src="inuicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I have so far enjoyed my weekend.  I was looking forward to seeing my sister today for lunch, but she went to Six Flags with her friends and I didn't want to head that way because I'm forsee being alittle strapped for cash.  I got a disturbing call from my supervisor TC yesterday.  He said that they were moving me to some new program, a program that I have always figured was an aggressive sales program.  It really upset my painting plans.  I wish I had stablity at my job, but it seems picking Dial America for my summer job was a mistake.  I plan on being alot more job assertive tomorrow, certainly.  I may give Trilegent a try, just to secure a pay check, but I'm also going to look for a new job.  And I'm going to give eBay a real try.  Tomorrow.</p>
<p>As for yesterday, Marilia came over and we worked on some house stuff.  The hallway hasn't looked this good in a long time.  Also, the fridge no longer looks like a forest floor.  We dusted and cleaned the windows.  The place should really shape up by the time my mom comes by.  I'm going to move things around the living room too.  I want to move the TV by the door and integrate the futon somehow.  I just need Milo's furniture out of here, and everything will be set.  I like doing house things.  This place is my favorite place to be, especially when friends come over.</p>
<p>We had some booze last night and went to Bones.  I made a trip to the liquor store and then to Walmart to get Marilia some spirits, but she didn't drink too much.  However, it sure looked like she had alot.  She's a light-weight.  I went out with Paul, Kyle, Marilia, and David, but Paul decided to wait at his apartment.  I got to see his room with the Digestive System painting and all the retro decorations.  It was very cool and the walls were brown.</p>
<p>Well, Boneshakers was alright, I saw Kris (or is it Chris?  I'll have to ask him).  I played some pool and, well, didn't do very much socializing because any vodka I had had worn off by that time.  I really need to drink very seriously one night.  I haven't been really drunk in a very long time.  It might have something to do with the absense of Everclear, but I really don't know.  Next time, I'll pick some up and see if it makes a difference.  Anyways, Gen came by, but I couldn't find a lesbian for her.  Kris was going to help me, but I couldn't find him.  I saw some old friends, which is nice, I wish I could see more people more often, but I don't think I can sit in that club more than once every few weeks.</p>
<p>I might go to ATL with Gen tomorrow, maybe.  I will be looking for a job, so if anyone has any suggestions, you can send them my way (or not).  For now, I'm going to sit around my house.  I feel like relaxing today and taking a day to breath and think.  Thinking is fun.  I like watching <i>The American President</i>, listening to techno songs Marilia has polluted my computer with, surfing the internet, and playing with my website on my computer.  If you need me, that's what I'll be doing.  Later.</p>
<p>BTW, Inuyasha was really funny last night.  Some kid tried to pee on Miroku's face, and Miroku fondled both Kagome and Sango's asses.  Horray for very odd anime :-)

<img border="0" src="butg.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>This week has been super low key.  The damned job situation has kept me out of work all week and I haven't sold a thing on eBay (though I still have 2 days).  Plus, on top of it all, I woke up with a stuffy nose yesterday >:o  Things will get better when classes start up again, and I get the loan.  Oh, scrumptious loan!  A lease on my future!  I'll pay you back some day 0:-)</p>
<p>Wednesday, Matt and I went to the gay bar and it was fun.  He had alot to drink, so when we went to The Grill so he could get some water and edibles to prevent certain barfage, and he doesn't remember very much of that.  I thought we could have tipped the waitress more.  Matt paid, the little gentleman, but I should have had some cash to supplement his bad behavior.  It's nice to have a Grill milkshake again.</p>
<p>Other then that, I've basically been stressing over the impending move out of Milo and the move in of INSERT PERSON HERE.  Oh, don't worry, it's going to be someone.  Either this guy Lee or the girl who was originally going to move it, Jennifer.  It's looking to be Jen.  I may have to move out of my big room, which the more I think about I think it's a good thing, because a smaller space would be nice and I think I could save some dough with the smaller rent.  I mean, $285 isn't that bad, but it would be different to get $20 more a month and to share a bathroom again.  We shouldn't live in the Master bedroom forever.  Plus, it might be cool living in the legendary Milo bedroom.  I'll never forget the orgies, the random hook-ups.  We've all had our moments in that room--I know I have ;-)</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm going to track down the ex-roomie for now and get my money!  I've got Bills, Bills, Bills in a disturbing, sad way.  I need to make them go away!  See you all later...maybe at Laura's party at Shoal Creek.  You know, if you're down with the sorority madness.  Or whatever they've got going on this weekend.
