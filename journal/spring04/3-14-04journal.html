<img border="0" src="inuicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>So when did the return of a term paper start causing massive heart palpitations?  Well, apparently this semester.  I got my massive-headache paper back--you know, the one I was stressing about all last week.  I got a B.  Most definitely deserved.  Considering the whole lack of quality work on my part, I shouldn't be surprised.  It's a shame I'm not as lucky as in years past.  Would be a tremendous pick-me-up to get a grade I don't deserve.</p>
<p>Um, so I've been having a bad week.  Sunday, I got a speeding ticket.  This started my major downer, and Matt was the only one who actually gave a shit about how miserable it made me feel.  I guess that's why I stick with him.  On Monday, I had a hell day of classes with an hour respite nap and then a pointless Lambda meeting.  I was very anti-social, but Marilia pointed out that that didn't seem to show.  And to think I was sure I was avoiding talking to people...  Anyways, on Tuesday, I had classes and then a much longer respite nap.  This was followed by Marilia-conversation, the massive purchase of vegetables, and the shameless sitting around in my room (highlighted by a visit from my favorite butch lesbian Genevieve!)</p>
<p>Well, I suppose I'll feel better.  I just felt very worthless on Monday, and ugly, and a bunch of other things.  I think I've been too optimistic lately and I should start looking down moreoften at the shit I've apparently sunk into, because it sucks.  Though Fink says we've all got alot going for us, I feel like I'm lazy and am more likely to watch to world go by than to jump on for the ride.  I think I can get better though.  I need to take the "I need a car" rant up a notch to my mother, as I'm quickly facing dwindling funds.  Honestly, as unappealing as a job is right now, having a sizeable influx of money has always notoriously been a pick-me-up.  Not sure how sizable that would be if I'm restricted to the daytime hours, as riding my bike at night just isn't an option for me.</p>
<p>So, I've got that going for me...the job search.  Want to be a server, but that's probably not goin' happen.  I think it would be nice speaking Spanish at Dial America...if boring.  Um, yah, and just alittle public notice, I still need two people to live with ASAP, and if any nitwit is reading this and needs a place to live, I'm still pretty desperate at Highland Park.  Rescue me from anxiety!  I feel like I'm going to choak on it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, perhaps, I'll be seeing <a href="../../friends/melissa.html">Melissa</a>.  I haven't seen her since I graduated, and since I'm fast becoming a dinosaur, that's a long time.  I bet she looks so pretty, she was always so pretty in high school, and such a good friend.  Also, Missy has informed me of a four kegger...and as appealing as that sounds, I may choose to forego it.  Something tells me that the college need to injest and vomit alcohol just isn't doing it for me anymore.  Only for Gen.</p>
<p>For now, I'm at Blue Sky, my traditional haunt from last year.  Increased daylight gives me the opportunity to slum around Athens a bit longer, you know.  There's a convenient little bike rack right out front, best spot in town!  Speaking of jobs, I saw a poster of a business that does bike delivery for some Athens restaurants.  Sounds right up my alley, huh...

<img border="0" src="shiticon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>So, you all may have noticed that I have stopped updating my Blog on a day-to-day basis.  I mentioned that I may be deciding to go back to my original pattern of doing things back at the beginning of the semester...I guess a few things led me to finally come to the decision.  I feel that probably the most vain and thus shameful thing to do is to publish a Blog and to use in the way certain people I've known over the years use it.  I think at times I've been guilty of this as well.  I believe if I go back to just the Sunday update, people will be less inclined to read my stupid Blog and actually talk to me.  Kind of easy getting your Nick fix online when all you really have to do is pick up a phone.  So, yah, those are my reasons.</p>
<p>Anyways, I didn't Blog too much this week anyways, I was in a funny mood.  Had a lot of time off and got to take advantage of some of it.  The last two nights I've slept until past noon. The first night, I was so tired from my visit with my high school friend Melissa.  She came over on Thursday and we talked for a while.  She showed me some of the student films she'd been acting in while over at USC.  We talked about high school people (united in our distain for a certain Aaron Shores) and perused or old year book.  We even gave Mattie a visit.  It was alot of fun seeing her, she looks amazing!  She always did.</p>
<p>Friday was actually alot of fun.  After waking up at noon, I skipped my first class, went to see Fink, and then I rode my bike down to Wal-mart (on the eastside) from campus.  I don't know what it was, I just wanted to do it.  Was not very difficult.  I came home, went to Moe's with my favorite lesbian, then I went to Agua Linda with my <i>other</i> favorite lesbian.  Too many corn chips :-x  Well, I went over to Missy's for some disgusting gin and tonic and got to talk to Jerm about his facinating trip to Cuba.  Very cool.  After we had some spirits, we went to some frat party and Missy stole some flavored beer out of this random guy's room.  That place was really disgusting, by the way.  Sonya said she could easily imagine someone getting raped in there (one of the frat guys took offense to that, he was a strange one).  Mattie and I got dropped off at Boneshakers and I gawked at ugly people, and we finally went in for the evening.</p>
<p>Most fun part of the night was me saving Marilia's car from a tree that was falling down in our yard.  When she pulled up, the branches started to scratch her roof and I told her it was probably because the tree was falling over.  She moved the car, and I started to try and pull the tree down.  Needless to say I was successful.  It was very cool, it crashed and cracked into pieces, and I saved Marilia's car :-)</p>
<p>Right now I'm enjoying the downtown scene.  I'm hoping my favorite lesbian decides she wants to come bike riding with me.  <i>We'll see</i>, I'm sure.  Tonight, 4 kegger!  Still not as many kegs as T-Mac, but what can you do?  Gotta take what you can get.
