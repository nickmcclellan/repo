<img border="0" src="missydrinkingicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Sadly, there will be no updated Blog this week as I will be crusin' around Florida for the week.  I'll be writing my traditional account of Missy and my shenanigans while we embark on this age old college tradition that is Spring Break.  You can expect my Blog about our trip around Sunday or Monday--hopefully with picture highlights!</p>
<p>Since I'll be be gone, if you want to reach, you can IM me at basuraboi3 (I will certainly still be forwarding messages to my cell phone).  I'll be back on Sunday, so you can probably wait until then.  Matt has a nationwide plan, so I certainly plan to call certain special someones, but if you must get in touch with moi, just text me your number (I'm at 7703642179) and I'll get back to you shortly</p>
<p>Everyone be safe and have fun!  I'll see you all very soon, I love you!
