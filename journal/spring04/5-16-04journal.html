<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="brandylj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>This has been the best day ever!  I've gotten so much today, I can't believe it.  If you had told me five months ago that a day like this was coming, I would laugh in your face.  Alot of people have gone out of their way for me today.  I don't want to disappoint them.</p>
<p>The first thing I got today was a car.  That's right, I have a car AT LAST.  My mother very graciously gave me her 98 Grand Prix.  She bought the car a few years ago when she was still married to dad and she took it with her to Ohio.  It's one of her most valuable possession, and she gave it to me.  She knows that I have not had the best luck in cars.  I've been stuck with the Shitmobile since I was 15 years old.  Ever since she got a job, it's been her dream to get me a reliable car--to provide me with the one thing that my dad would never do for me.  Certainly, he gave me a car, but in light of the reliable (and <i>comfortable</i>) 97 Grand Am he got for my sister, the car he provided for me was a six year insult.  When she got that car, I swear, that day I felt absolutely worthless.  I feel the exact opposite today.  Having someone give me something so precious to them because they love me is incredible.  I'm very grateful, and I plan on taking very good care of that car.  It's very nice.</p>
<p>The second good thing that happened to me was my aunt gave me $2500.  Yah, I know, I said she was going to give me $2000, but it turns out she upped it just a bit since I didn't get to go along with them to Vegas.  I had a nice afternoon with her and I would like to come see her more often since now I have the means to do so.  I'm very happy that things are working out for her.  She says that the move has awakened her to the type of spending that had been killing her.  She says she wants to put her money in a place so that it will continue to provide for her for many years to come.  I'm hopeful she will achieve this.  I'm happy that she will be ok.  I love her and dearly appreciate the money she's given me.  It will go along way this summer (rent, computer, eBay investments...)</p>
<p>Other good things that happened to me:  while I was driving through Kentucky, I listened to one of my Japanese mp3's and was about to explode with glee.  I also made excellent time on the drive back to Georgia.  I am actually hanging out with my good friend April right now--I love her!  She's really sexy :-*  I'm going to see Rachel tomorrow.  She's probably more sexy than the last time I saw her.  I got a bunch of new clothes from my sister and mom.  I have new shoes and socks!  Oh, and I have a really great boyfriend!  Everything feels pretty right.  I just need a job :-x</p>
<p>We'll work on that for Wednesday...you know, while we move into the Dell ;-)
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, May 20th</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="inuicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Welcome to my new Dell!  Yup, that's right.   Here I am in the bowels of my new computer.  Poor little Pro-Star will likely collect dust in the closet.  It's sad, really...</p>
<p>I've had some issues with the Dell.  For one, all that crap software and utitilies they send with it.  I'm sorry, but if I'm going to connect to my wireless network, I'll do it, I don't need some Dell utility to hold my hand through the whole "ordeal."  Oh, yah, and this one utility set my power preferences. I took one look at it, and--Surprise! Surprise!--it's virtually the same Windows utility when you right click on the battery icon.  I think I've gotten most of the Dell crap.  I would like to dump the Solution Center...might make a siege tomorrow.  I'll let it sit in my Start folder--for now!</p>
<p>The resolution on my new computer is pretty amazing.  Fonts look so pretty!  The sound is better.  The theme needs to be tweaked.  You know how creative I am.  Viewing my website through this computer has revealed to me an imperfection in the background of my current website theme.  If you've noticed it, it's been fixed.  Hmmm, other than that, everything is normal.</p>
<p>Not much going on here.  I'm going to go over to Matt's tonight for a change of pace.  Britcoms and <i>Friends</i>.  Hopefully the boy has bought some food.  I've done some serious snacking today.  Too many Peeps (don't ask me how I got my hands on those in May).</p>
<p>Have you ever seen <a href="http://www.techtv.com" target="_blank">TechTV</a>?  It's an excellent channel!  My favorite shows are the Screensavers and Call for Help.  For some reason, Call for Help's last show is on Friday.  If you have a chance, watch it.  It's very helpful.  Just yesterday, they told me about this very useful utility called Yahoo Pops that enables Outlook Express to access a Yahoo mail account without making you pay the $20 fee that Yahoo asks for.  I haven't been able to get into Outlook Express since I was a freshman!  I very much prefer this interface to the web interface that's full of ads and other nastiness.  I've also found programs like IE Privacy Keeper (which regularly cleans cookies, history, and temporary Internet files) and other things.  They highlight so many common utilities in the many operating systems available.  For example, they showed me howto enable the Internet firewall included in Windows XP--an excellent way to protect your PC.  If you're knowledgeable on all the techno-babble, you will love these programs!</p>
<p>Well, I wanted to make an entry on the new computer, and I guess that's done.  This computer is awesome, so much nicer than the last one, and get this!  BATTERY!  5 HOURS LONG!  That's one upgrade I DON'T regret.  Hell yes...

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, May 22nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="brandylj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Yah, another annoying Brandy face!  I swear, someday things are going to get worse.  I'm feeling the cynicism just coming onto me right now, it's uncontrollable!</p>
<p>Matt got his license!  At long last...  My only words on the subject are to be that <i>I</i> was the one who helped him get it.  Damnit,if I had my car months ago, he'd have the license even before today, but you know how hard it has been with me not having my car.  Well, things are good again.  He's soon-to-be mobile, and I'm cruisin' often.  Life is good.</p>
<p>I'm so much happier now than I have been in the last few months.  School is fun and all, but it just feels good having those pressures off me.  Having the opportunity to focus on <i>other</i> pressures, like money and my broader future.  Those things are getting better.  I think I'll end up spending about $1000 of my next egg, which gives me a typical money-making aim for the summer.  $1000.  It's been done before.  I think other summer things will be happier as well.</p>
<p>Over the past two days, I've been doing things I haven't been able to do in well over a year:  HANG OUT WITH PEOPLE!  Yah, all those allegations that I didn't like hanging out with Matt's friends are bullshit, because it was all the Shitmobile's fault of stifling me from mobile friendliness.  Damned car.  Yesterday, we went out to the Grit with April.  We played party video games most of the night, then a bunch of green Cranium questions.  Today, after we got Matt's license, we went out to this restaurant Peppino's.  Lots of fun people...  I got this delicious chicken parmisiana sub, and I'm about to go finish it.  After lunch, we went to this animal park with a bear, owls, and otters.  It was all rainy, so we went back and played a monster game of Cranium.  Evan and I got 3rd place.  How was I supposed to know Bugs Bunny was based on Clarke Gable!?  Silly wabbit.</p>
<p>So, not sure what we're doing tonight.  Cheers to surprises.  Later, faithful readers.</p>
<p>BTW, did you hear I got a job?  Yah, maybe I didn't mention that.  Yet another spot of goodness 0:-)
