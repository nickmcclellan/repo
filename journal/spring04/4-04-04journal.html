<img border="0" src="kikyoicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Hey!  I just wanted to chime in with something since I'm all perky from the oodles of sleep I got last night.  Things are ok here I guess, I just need to start working on some stuff.  I'm pretty sure I've got a test Thursday.  I should be all over that come Wednesday (though there's <i>Back to the Future Part II</i> playing at Tate which I really want to see with Matt).  Today, I have a coffee date with the Pad and I'm gonna give her her present.  I need to get that all "wrapped up" after class today.  Also, seems I forgot that I need to register for classes today :-p  Lots of things to do...</p>
<p>Last night was the Lambda Election and, unlike last year, I am not looking forward to a year of gay student organization fun.  I have opted out of a 'nother year of insanity.  I am glad I did what I did, it was a rewarding experience, but I think I need to live my life on the outside for a while.  Funny thing, they don't have gay student unions in the real world.  You just sort of get on without all that.</p>
<p>Matt is taking my spot on the killing floor.  Good luck to him, I will try to be as much of a help as I can.  He's probably best for the job.  He's all John protegé #2.  He has alot of really neat ideas for the next year, and if one of his good friends decided to fill a certain vacant position on the Board, I think he will have as much fun as Marilia and I had this year.  It's nice having a friend among vicious strangers.</p>
<p>Well, the sun's up and I have to shower.  See you all around!

<img border="0" src="shiticon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Do you like my Kikyo icon?  I was going to go into an entry this week about how much I enjoy the character Kikyo, but I never got around to it.  I saw an episode with Kikyo this week which was really good.  I'm actually trying to write a poem about the character.  She's very intriguing, I can't quite explain it, which makes writing the poem very difficult.  Anyways, I digress...</p>
<p>It's been a tough week.  Thursday really sucked, I know I bombed my test, I don't know what I'm going to have to do.  Work harder I guess.  Friday was alot better.  Fink's class was so interesting!  This girl Jessica Reese came and talked about thig magazine she started in Augusta called <i>Lounge</i>.  The thing is, she's 21 and she's doing something that's completely amazing, I wish I had something like that, and it occured to me--maybe I do.  Our last term paper is similar to what she did:  make a business plan.  I want to make a business plan for something similar in Athens, I just need to think about it.  I guess if I'm far enough along, I'll show it to Fink and see if he thinks it's cool.  That will make me feel better, I suppose, until Tuesday when I realize just how bad I bombed my test.  No snow day's going to stop this now.</p>
<p>Last night my sister came to see me and took me out to the Varsity.  She brought me an Easter basket!  Can you believe that?  She drove 2 hours from Marietta to make <i>me</i> fat.  She's incredible, I can't believe her.  I have the best sister ever.  Her shirt was not the best fashion choice, but her candy selections were positively heavenly.  Definitely need to ride the bike next week...</p>
<p>Oh, I found an internet pet...Look at my new friend Chick:</p>

<p>I need to write for Spanish today, but I don't think I'm going to go to the library.  I have laundry business to attend to.  Tonight, I would like to watch movies with Beth.  I bet she doesn't think I'm going to call her...hehe, well, I'm all into proving her wrong.  I really want to see <i>Look Who's Talking Too</i> for some reason.  Hopefully that's going to happen.</p>
<p>Alright, later folks!
