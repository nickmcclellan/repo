<img border="0" src="dearest.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Yah, I promised an entry on Saturday, but I lied.  I've been so busy toolin' around, I just haven't been in the Blog space.  In the absense of my regular rant, I hope you are enjoying my <a href="../fall01/index.html" target="_blank">2001 Journal</a> entries.  It's a bitch having to go through that journal and type all that stuff into the computer, but for the sake of completing my website, I guess I have nothing better to do.  I wish I wrote less about a certain someone and wrote more about the day-to-day stuff.  Like most freshman, my life started at 5pm Thursday (sometimes 11pm Wednesdays) and ended at 11:59pm Sunday.  It's a shame I didn't spend more time on my schoolin'</p>
<p>I just got back from Commerce with Genevieve--my first time going to the land of outlet malls.  I got a new rain jacket since some asshole stole my most favorite rain jacket from the Lambda Office.  Hopefully this jacket will protect me from all corrosive rains of Athens.  We went to the other Agua Linda and I stressed about my tip.  We also saw Genevieve's psycho ex-girlfriend's car.  Scary stuff.  Drama in Commerce!</p>
<p>Other then that, I'm trying desperatly to sell anything on Half.com.  News on my first sale ANY DAY NOW!  I'll also post my store link on here one of these days.</p>
<p>For now, I'm waiting for Saturday.  Doing the beer/lesbian thing then!  Can't wait.  Going to get all the lesbian I can.  Before it's all gone.</p>

By the way, how's my hair looking?  I like it!  Lovin' the longer hair...</div>

<h2 class="date-header">Thusday, June 24th...12:38 a.m.</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="kikyoicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Damnit!  My lesbian doesn't want to play pool.  Did you hear me?!  SHE DOESN'T WANT TO PLAY POOL!!!  That's in her job description!  She's supposed to want to drink beer and play pool on no cover night so she can see the available lesbians and proposition them for sexual favors. I, on the sidelines, hold her pool cue and talk to whoever thinks I'm interesting.  Sadly, not alot of people give me much attention anymore.  All for the lesbian...</p>
<p>So today, I started off the afternoon with a good run.  I didn't run very much, but I think I should probably build up my endurance.  Other than that, I got some lunch, tooled around, called the lesbian, and went to work early to change my shift for something that's coming up.  Unfortunatly, all for nothing >:o</p>
<p>Uh, I think I'll head to bed or play the game for a little bit before bed.  Yah, bed.  I think I need to sleep.  Kind of need it everyday.  Anyways, later.
