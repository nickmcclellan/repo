<h2 class="date-header">Monday, January 26th...TRIAL DAY!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Today's the big day.  Noise ordinance trial.  I hope I have money to give back to Matt and Liz.  If not, I'm going to be sad...and broke.</p>
<p>AND I have the flu...or something flu-like.  Isn't that nice.  Class at 9:05 a.m.  Even better.  Just let everything freeze, and I'll be better.</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<img border="0" src="brandylj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I WON!!!  Yes, the noise ordinance trial was a complete success!  I don't know if the average avid-Blog reader is aware, but during Chris and Liz's party last semester, things got out of control in more than a Missy w/ boys way.  A cop showed up (which isn't unexpected at <i>my</i> parties), and I was, for some odd reason, NOT drunk and able to deal with the situation.  He basically told me that we were violating the noise ordinance and he was going to give me a ticket.  Everyone at the party was bummed for me as I went to my room to look to see how much the fine would be...<b>$125</b>.  Sucky.</p>
<p>I instantly wanted to fight the citation.  My court date was some day in November.  It was a Thursday and it was cold.  I showed up and there were tons of people in the hall waiting to enter the court room.  It was very interesting, I don't mean to be pretentious, but it was sociologically facinating.  It was really interesting seeing these black men complain about cops only wanting money from them.  I think it was alittle more complicated than that.  Anyways, I was scared shitless.  I didn't realize that I wouldn't have the opportunity to explain my case at this court date, I had to wait for a <i>trial</i>!  That's really intimidating.  I mean, witnesses, cross-examinations!  It was very scary, I almost paid for the citation.</p>
<p>Something stopped me though.  We have this right in the constitution to a fair trial, and I am the sort of wide-eyed idiot that believes that maybe I too have a chance at justice.  Seeing this guy get sentenced for DUI, it was really neat.  The judge talked all fast and I thought maybe I'd see if there really was a bias against college student in Athens.  I also got two months to make the money for the ticket in the event that I decided to change my plea.</p>
<p>As the trial neared, I got more and more confident, more and more lazy, and then last week, I got kinda scared.  If they would have let me change my plea over the phone, I would have done it.  This weekend, while I was sick and bored, I got to thinking.  There's no evidence against us.  It's their word against <i>ours</i>.  I regained my confidence.  I called Marilia and Jeremy over last night and we built our case.  Marilia said I wrote my statement well.  We joked on the way over to the courthouse, I was ready for anything.  Win or lose, I had my checkbook or a pocketfull of cash for a celebratory milk shake.</p>
<p>We walked in, sat down.  Read the trial procedures sheet.  Scary, I would be asking my witnesses questions instead of reading a statement...wasn't expecting that.  Pressure rising.  The judge called some guy to the bench.  She informed in that the officer that was subpoenaed in his case did not show up, so charges were dropped against him and he was free to go.  I thought to myself, "Damn, that's nice!"  Wouldn't be that easy for me...</p>
<p>Then she called <i>me</i> and suddenly I thought I must be first.  I came to the bench and she informed me and two other guys that were called to the bench that the officers subpoenaed in our cases did not appear in court and the charges would be dropped against us and we were free to leave.  <b>HELL FUCKIN' YEAH!</b>  It was over!  We were in that room for five minutes, and it was over!  Marilia, Jeremy, and I went to the Grill and Gyro Wrap to celebrate.  I called some people.  Matt had just sent me a "Good Luck" text message right when I called to give him the news.  He was really surprised.</p>
<p>I was on Cloud 9 after leaving the court.  It's over.  Not only is this noise ordinance crap over, but classes were cancelled today and I got to legitimately skip the classes I was going to skip anyway because I was sick/dealing with legal issues.  It's been a really good day for me, probably one of the best I've had in a long time.  Seriously, I said something about it being the best day ever, but maybe not quite.  I don't think I achieved anything today, I just got really lucky.  Maybe that day of achievement will come sometime soon, maybe in May.  For now, I'm going to lay down or something.  I earned it.

<img border="0" src="cupofcoffee.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I don't think I'll like Tuesdays this year.  No Buffy in 2004, that's sad.</p>
<p>I was trying to take a nap today and I couldn't stop coughing.  Annoying, and I really do love sleeping.  Seems, though, after the trial, I don't know what to do.  I have homework tonight, but that's so <i>boring</i>.  I want to do something else.  Nothing as stressful as worrying about paying a $125 fine, something to look forward to in the near future.  Since I won the trial, I suppose I should deliver on that promise for a party to celebrate.  That could be my "near future."  I don't want to do it at my house though.  Even though I'd go to every length to prevent the cops from coming, I'm afraid that it won't be enough.  I want to do it someplace else.  I want to have a party to end all parties.  I have yet to go to a party this semester...maybe this weekend.</p>
<p>I seem to be getting over the flu, or whatever it was that I had.  I maintain that it must be my close contact with disgusting college students that has maintained this three year running streak with the flu.  This semester's brush with evil phlegm has been the lesser of evils, I didn't even need to go to the doctor.  I'm thinking it was probably a cold because of this.  I was miserable, but I never had raging fevers like in previous years.  Last year was very bad.  Maybe I'm healthier than last year?  I don't know.  Hopefully I feel good enough to take my bike home tomorrow.  I hate sitting for 45 minutes on a bus.  It's so weak.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm coming in on this at the 11th hour, but have you seen <a href="http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com">badgerbadgerbadger.com</a>?  It's very strange.  Catchy though.  Anyways, I'll have something less ambiguous to write later this week...maybe nothing at all (btw, just noting that it was 2 years ago that I first started the Internet Journal...just alittle history)</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, January 28th...Internet Journal Birthday!</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="spnick.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Some very cool things materialized last night.  I think we might be having that party.  Oh, I just get dizzy just <i>thinking</i> how drunk I'll be.</p>
<p>Scratch that.  Well, not really.  Just wanted to clarify I'm NOT an alcoholic, I think I proved that last year when I went 2 months w/o drinking before my birthday.  I mean, Chris and Liz's birthday party was THE party to get wasted at, and I had an amazing time just being sober.  Also, I think I was very responcible handing the noise ordinance thing that night and the court dates that followed.  I would say I'm very mature, and when Missy and I decide to have a party, it's because we've had a very stressful few weeks in this crap town, and we're tired of being bored on the weekends!  We want to have a party with our friends and, you know, see things happen.  It's better than sitting at home bitching about your wretched existence.  So, we're going to do it!</p>
<p>Not the bitching, the partying.  Seems that Saturday, Matt is willing to volunteer his place for some drinking.  That might be fun.  Kind of impromptu.  Next Saturday though...if what I think we can manage it...it will be the noise ordinance win celebration party!  Everyone must come!  Oh, the possibilities!  I've found my "near future" :-)
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Friday, January 30th</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="shirlface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Err, it's really college when you have to find an internship for the summer and work weeks in advance on term papers.  Does <i>anyone</i> know how I can get my hands on at least 3 Chicago Tribunes and 3 Chicago Sun-Times, I'd really like to know how.  Also, everyone is in the roommate fever and I find I'm behind the pace, yet again.  I want to stay in Highland...does anyone want to live with me?  I need two responcible roommates.  I guess that's hard to find, sometimes.  Well, hopefully not too hard.</p>
<p>So I'm having a party on February 7th.  It's half celebrate my dead dog's birthday other half noise ordinance trial victory party!  It's going to be at Sonya's apartment (don't ask me how that happened).  To avid-Blog readers who actually keep up with my goings-on, haven't been talking to Sonya in a long while.  Saw her last semester one night at Boneshakers and we talked for a while, decided that the past was the past, and it really wasn't worth it anymore.  I think there's blood on both our hands, so I really don't see any point in fueling past disagreements.  I guess that's sort of the third point of having a party at her place.  It should be alot of fun, I'm really glad I don't have my nasty noise sensitive neighbors to hold me back.  I want to have FUN.</p>
<p>I have some things tonight...various activities, my favorite of which is certainly sleep.  This weekend I have some readings to do, I really should start being a bit more proactive w/ school related things.  Fink's term paper may prove to be a royal pain.  I still haven't gone to creative writing since the second week of classes, that's probably not good.  Can't help it if God wants to rain down ice and other nastiness on my class days.  I'm up for anything.</p>
<p>Ok, I'll bow for now.

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, January 31st</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="lilyface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Rent's due tomorrow.  January has bitten the dust.  Some month.  I started things in the bowels of Rich's - Macy's (actually, more accurately in Dayana's bed w/ my very hung over boyfriend), and I've ended things with hopefully pizza on this Saturday night.  I must say, working at Rich's - Macy's was a miserable experience, but it all seems like a dream to me now.  The money, fortunatly, is alittle more real :-)</p>
<p>Last night, Marilia and I hosted a defunct movie night.  I wanted to get ideas for my "dirty heart" decorations, but instead I got alot of inappropriate phrases and a bunch of people who'd rather go Boneshakin' than work on the decorations.  I guess it's easier to think of gutter trash than to be witty, I lament.  I suppose if we had a meeting Monday we could have hyped it alot more, but what can you do.  I'll have to think of my own phrases.  I had fun despite not finishing watching <i>Election</i>.  I haven't gone to Boneshakers on a Friday during my third year at UGA in, well, ever.</p>
<p>It was B.J., Kyle, and Marilia, and we were all supposed to come over to my place to hang out before heading downtown, but I suppose Kyle takes long showers.  I prefer the hanging out to the actual Boneshakin'.  They finally came by, but then they wanted to leave again >:o  They dropped me off at Missy's, and I had some drinks w/ her, Sonya, and Ilya.  Very intoxicating, but not so much.  Probably good I wasn't off and mumbling at Boneshakers.</p>
<p>So-so evening.  I don't know why I go to the place.  People should just come over and hang out with me.  I have a better time with my friends than I do going out to see creepy old people gawk at us.  I guess we'll just have to have a party next week, seems like the only option :-)</p>
<p>"Noise That Keeps Me Awake" I guess because it's garbage, for one.  Second, noise ordinance.  I guess I could have done something like last year's "Fever", since, you know, I had a fever.  I think it's ok.</p>
<p>I'll be around, don't be afraid to come knockin'.
