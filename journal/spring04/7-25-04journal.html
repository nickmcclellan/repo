<img border="0" src="dearest.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Yah, so I'm awake doing things that I should probably have done earlier this evening.  I guess I'm just bored.  I'd rather not sleep, you know, because it would be kind of a let down.  You know, alot of interesting things happen after 2 a.m., and I should know :-)</p>
<p>So I went to work today, and it SUCKED LIKE HELL!  OMG, it's was so boring, and I have 6 more hours of it left today.  How sucky is that?!  Yah, I'm not looking forward to waking up in the morning and having to sit through that hell again.  The only fun thing is there are 2 reps that used to be in my team that are training with me.  They are older guys, but they were really good at what they did, so I know I'm not a lame ass for being transferred.  And though I'm not looking forward to taking calls, I do believe the incentives are alot better.  I should do a good job at paying my debt back before Christmas.  I figure a good 20 hours a week for a few months should have that squared away.  Now if only I had $15,000 for the student loans...:-/</p>
<p>I made a collage of all my icons for the Spring 2004 journals.  It's really cool looking, it will be the last icon of this journal section.  Also, I'll blow it up so you can actually puruse all of my mood icons for the year.  I think in my next batch (the theme of which I'm still brewing in my head), I'm going to add the good ol' <i>Current Music</i> info.  You know, I think that would be especially informative for someone like me.  I always have some odd song in my head.  Right now...Jimmy Eat World "Sweetness."  It reeks 2001/2002.  In like the most awesome My-first-year-at-UGA way.</p>
<p>Rock on man!

<img border="0" src="kikyoicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I suppose it was bound to end.  The "cushion" part of the summer.  You know, all the vestiges of my Junior year slipping away.  Every so slowly, I realize my last year is upon me.  So many things to do.  Remake the website.  Make my schedule.  Move out the roommates.  Hey, but that's done, isn't it?</p>
<p>Milo's gone.  It was good while it lasted, but his self-deprecating attitude toward the end of the whole ordeal was alittle out of the ordinary.  Stand up for yourself buddy.  You've got more coming to you if you'd just stand up for yourself.  So many things I can say, but I'll just say <u>thank you</u>.  You were a roommate--and in the end, that's all you'll ever be.</p>
<p>Sometimes I hit something right on the head...anyways.  I've had a busy day, and a busy week.  Sure, plenty of napful times, it's a lazy summer, right?  I'm happy though.  The roommate situation is stable (sort to say).  Genevieve now lives hella closer than before.  My mom's coming to visit next week.  And I'll be receiving aid this year clear of the gloomy shadow of my father.  All in all, things are looking great.</p>
<p>I liked Kerry's speech last night.  I feel like when a man like John Kerry says something like "Freedom, not Fear," it means something.  When Bush uses rhetoric like "evil-doers" and "freedom", it doesn't mean anything.  It's so abstract and ill-defined, he is simply encouraging the same atmosphere of fear the he is seemingly trying to dissipate with his "War on Terror".  What is the threat, Bush?  Clouds of anthrax?  Is that terrorist group "Food Not Bombs" planning to lash out against democracy?  I can't wait to see the Republican convention.  I feel where Democrats are inclusive, Republicans seek to divide America and claim the whole as their own.  His speech has got to blow.  I'm sure every uninformed nobody will be impressed.  That doesn't take much.</p>
<p>Well, I guess I can put and end to this week.  In retrospective, this week has been about moving and moving on.  Everyone seems to be doing it these days.  A new school year is just around the corner.  As much as we wished we could be together, it can't happen--it's sadly impossible.  The past is the past, but the future's up to us.  Maybe, someday.</p>
