<img border="0" src="brandylj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>This whole publishing the journal weekly thing has its disadvantages.  It turns out my computer is suffering from some debilitating disease known as the notorious <i>Blue Screen of DEATH!</i>  I wish I could be all non-vain and truly serve the reasons I do this whole sort of thing, but in order to keep my website updated online so that in the case my computer crashes and I lose everything I'll have my ass covered, I'm going to have to update on a daily basis--you know, if I am that much of a blabbermouth.  After this Blog, things will be back to normal...maybe until I get my Dell ;-)</p>
<p>There's something I want to share with you:</p>
<blockquote><i>[Your] paper more than delivers.  Trying memory and reminiscence to class serves to bring out the complexities of this play, while at the same time providing a unifed theme with which to make more general observations.  Your treatment of these matters is trenchant and provocative, and (in stark contrast to your first paper) the writing is graceful and poised.  Well done.</i></blockquote>
<p>Well, I guess that brings the tally to...</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Seven page Spanish paper (in Spanish!)</i>:  87</li>
<li><i>Third Fink Term Paper</i>:  A-</li>
<li><i>Advanced Creative Writing Paper</i>:  A</li>
<li><i>Final Modern Drama Paper</i>:  A</li>
<li><i>Shakespeare Image Study</i>:  91</li>
</ul>
<p>I did it!  I got my first A in an upper lever English class.  On another note, I got my second C in an upper level English class, but at least this semester I didn't get another WF in an upper level English class.  Basically, I did it, I proved to myself I wasn't an idiot, I am worth something, especially when I put my mind to it.  It's all about sitting down, focusing, and really putting your whole mind into everything you do.  Um, that sounds lame, I know, but I'm excited about this new sense of confidence.  Things suddenly don't feel as bad as they did six months ago.  I'm not a fool, and I have myself to thank.  Congratulations to me :-D</p>
<p>In other news, I had my interview at Dial America and I took a nap.  I don't think the interview went well, but the nap was bliss.  I'll have to expand my job search tomorrow.  Tonight, I think I'll do some eBay market research.  By Wednesday, I'll be buying my Dell.  Anyways, hope everyone is having a good summer.  God knows it will be better when I have my car and we can go to Boneshakers, get drunk, dance, pass out, and sleep until 4 p.m.  Ah...how sweet that would be!

<img border="0" src="vendetta2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Too many Brandy faces...I had to switch it up.  Yah, even though it's another good entry with good news.</p>
<p>I will be mobile once more on THURSDAY!  Yup, I'm flying to Ohio on Thursday and that's when I'm getting my mother's car.  I'll be in the Prix within a week!  I won't be back in Athens until at least Monday or Tuesday next week.  I'm going to be driving back to Georgia in the car with my cousin Laura.  I want to stayin Marietta for a day or two.  I am dying to see April and Rachel.  I also probably have some mail to pick up.  Probably wouldn't want to stay too long, I really need to find that job :-/</p>
<p>I should clean my room today.  Maybe I'll buy that laptop...hmmm, I dunno.  Definitely need to pick that up before Wednesday.  I've never put $1000+ on my credit card before.  It's all scary, you know?  But free shipping...10% off...that's a little too hard to turn down.  Ok, well, off I go...Bye.

<img border="0" src="shiticon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Guess where I am!  I'm in the airport.  It's a little under an hour before my plane leaves, and I'm all studious and here on time.  I wouldn't want to miss my flight.  I get to Dayton, Ohio at 10:50.  Likely, I'll engorge myself on all the foodstuffs my mother has to offer...and that's alot of foodstuffs.</p>
<p>Yesterday there was some drama.  It is of the drama that does not appear here, it's of the family drama variety.  Not fun stuff.  Yah, it's alright though.  It's like poetic justice, if you know what I mean, and likely you don't.  I got lots of time with the cat last night, it was oodles of fun.  Lily has not forgotten about me, she just loves to cuddle and lick up the remainder of milk from my Cocoa Krispies.  She's pretty funny.</p>
<p>Uh, I'm really just writing here because I'm bored and I figure something creative will help me pass the time.  Having a laptop with a non-functioning battery really sucks, let me tell you.  I can't even say hi to friendly Blog readers from the plane!  That blows huh.  I guess I'll go down to the gate in about ten minutes.  Let's see if there's anything I need to update you all on...</p>
<p>I bought my computer.  Abouts $1400.  Jeremy is pretty cool, even if the water in his toilet goes the wrong way around.  I've been dreaming alot about driving lately.  You know when you're driving with someone (like Marilia) and they drive like a crazy person, and all you can think about is what <i>you</i> would do if you were in their position?  Been thinking of that.  My sister is cool.  She got me jeans :-)  Can't wait to see April and Rachel.  Don't want to pay for gas.</p>
<p>That is all.

<img border="0" src="dearest.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm in Ohio!  Obviously I've been busy.  Well, not so much busy as being bored.  I've been working on my mom's computer making it much more efficient.  Yah, I think spyware and adware are like my ultimate nemises.  I'm all out for their total distruction!</p>
<p>My grandma smokes too much.  I can't sit here any longer, it's just going to make me die if I take in one more lung full of cigarette (do you know how much I hate that word?)  Anyways...</p>
<p>My computer is coming on Monday (so says the website) so it's tootles to the short lived "nick."  Good riddance to Pro-star...I will never invest into a one of those again.  Anyone who buys something with the words "Notebook Computer" on the bottom of it had better WATCH OUT!  They are loud, hot, and a big liability.  You better get a 5 year warrenty!</p>
<p>Ok, dying of asfixiation.  Bye.

<h2 class="date-header"><i>Wednesday, May 19th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Notice that this entry is late.  This folly was somewhat intentional (an otherwise not, due to computer issues).  Anyways, it's been brought to my attention that some people would rather read this thing than actually talk to me.  I think my Blog is an excellent place to go to if you are interested in my musings and pedantic rants, but it is not a place to get the inside scoop on my life and its various goings-on.  I just want to go on the record that this thing is not a substitute for conversation, it is an <b>excuse</b>.  That's so despicable--especially in the case that you'd rather visit this place instead of interacting with someone you supposedly care about--that I don't know why you even bother.</p>
<p>Anyways, that is all.  Tootles!</i>
