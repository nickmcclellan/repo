<img border="0" src="ylsfshirl.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Last night I went to the 4 kegger for Noa's birthday.  Very big, lots of people.  Matt knew more people than I did.  I sort of floundered between the hunch punch cooler and Sonya's car.  Kept going out there to take a shot of Bacardi with Matt, but we always seemed to be interupted...</p>
<p>No, I wasn't wasted, as some would think.  I really think over the last year I've gotten alot better with alcohol.  It's not fun to drink for me anymore, at least in the traditional ways I used to do it.  I am not sure what way is going to do it for me, I know I enjoy drinking with friends, but the last few times I've tried to do just that, it hasn't worked.  Maybe I'm not with the right friends, or I'm not doing the things I want to do, I am not sure what it is.  I'm still figuring that one out.</p>
<p>Well, Missy was at the party, needless to say.  The moment of the night came with Missy bring two underage boys back to Sonya's SUV to hide from the cops.  The crawled inside, the older of the two into the back.  Missy picked up the near-empty bottle of Vanilla Bacardi that I had hidden at Sonya's request.  She offered it to boys, and they promptly responded, "No--No, Missy."  she shrugged, shot what was left, and tossed the bottle out of the car.  Yes, a classic moment.  The highlight for me came when April answered my tipsy phone call at one in the morning.  It was pouring down raining, and there I was in my Old Navy anorak, drenched and talking about Inuyasha.  It was beautiful.  I am puzzled--why do I fall in love with women that have no idea what I'm saying--and don't care.  I don't understand.</p>
<p>Today, I talked to my mother, subtly hinting that a car would be nice...soon, please.  I went to the Grill and had a milk shake with some fries too.  Matt went to sell pizzas at Russell.  It was a lazy Sunday.  I'm happy that I get to sleep in tomorrow, but I have a conference with my ENGL 4800 teacher at noon.  Wish me luck.  I wonder how many words it will take for her to tell me that I suck.

<img border="0" src="brandylj.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I suppose this entry deserves a Brandy face.  Seems I will be in Highland for another year, THANK GOD.  I'm going to live with David and Jen, some people I know.  Yay!  No more Lambda Board roommates.  I suppose Stefanie will stop calling me when she can't seem to get the courage to talk to Marilia.  Horray!</p>
<p>It would have been nice to live with some friends, but it's interesting how they disappear when you really REALLY need them.  Anyways, despite the good news that I'd be signing a lease this week, I have still had a crappy week.  I have alot of papers coming up and I need A's on all of them.  I am thinking this would be a good time to do some hard work and feel really good about that.  I may try to do just that tomorrow.  First up, seven page Spanish paper.  I guess that's a feat in itself.  I don't know many people who can write seven pages in Spanish, so points for me, I'm pretty sure I can do that.</p>
<p>I titled this week "Pure Romantic Party" from this blurp I read in a classified in Creative Loafing.  I thought it was funny...it made me giggle.  What also amused me today was my lunch out with Matt.  We went to Subway and he was worried he was going to be late.  I, of course, riding my bike, was confident I could get anywhere in a timely manner.  He showed up (surprising quickly for a fair-abled biped).  Well, I wouldn't let him take Milledge back because he was sure he'd be late.  I instead insisted we walk back, which Matt of course pissed and moaned about.  I even suggested the glimmer of certain hope that would be an Athens bus that was <i>sure</i> to come by.  He scoffed at that--fool!  Sure enough, number 9 comes rolling along to pick his lazy ass up off the curb.  I (not so surprisingly excellent-abled body) rode along at a brisk pace on my bicycle with Coke in hand.  I even beat the bus, making it to Tate Center just as Matt was pulling up.  He had ten minutes to spare, and all I had to say was, "Told you so!"  It was fun, I love riding my bike :-)</p>
<p>Tomorrow will certainly be an unpleasant day.  9:30 class + Spanish quiz + proactive Spanish paper effort + Lambda Office (since everyone else will be doing the Civil Marriage table) + the worst of all, Lambda Board meeting.  There's a reason they call them <i>bored</i>--err, um, <i>board</i> meetings.  I'll get back to you on that.</p>
<p>Maybe tomorrow I'll make a Sherry Cherry, I've been feeling the itch lately.  I see all these other online comics, I really should come out and put people in their place.  I'll see what I can do.

<img border="0" src="ccb.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Last night's buzz was just TOO GOOD not to write about.  I went with Marilia to hang out at Kyle's place and I picked up a bottle of Everclear on the way over.  After about four drinks, I was on a roll.  I woke up two dear friends of mine--Gen and John--and I had fun harassing my sister about some stuff (told EVERYONE I loved them!)  We went to Boneshakers and then we were going to go to one of Aiman's parties (you know, the kind they have to put on the listserv because nobody would come otherwise).  Fortunatly, no one was there (go figure) and we couldn't hang around Bones because of an annoying cover charge.  Because of this, we went off to this guy Chip's party...here are some drunken stories...</p>
<p>For one, I could have been charged twice for public urination (not glamorous, I know :-x)  When we were at IHOP, I thought it would be fun to go into some Toy Story quotes...<i>"I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet...but we're not on my planet, are we?"</i>  Anyways, it was also really interesting when Paul just randomly vomitted in front of us...it was interesting making up a story about <i>that</i>.  Also, kissing Marilia was fun.  Oh, yah!  When we got to IHOP, I thought it would be appropriate to yell, "FUCK DA POLICE!"  Marilia had fun with that one...</p>
<p>Yah, well, I'm going to lay down some more...I'll leave you with the quote of the evening:</p>
<div align="center">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr>
<td><div align="left">The distinct scent of ass descends upon Marilia and me...<br>
<i><b>Marilia</b>:  ...was that you, Nick?<br>
