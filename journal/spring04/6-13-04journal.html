<img border="0" src="kikyoicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm so sorry :-(  I haven't written at all!  What's up with that?  Well, I suppose you'll have to get by with this entry and my scrumptious new retrospective 2001 Journal.  It's full of immature freshman goodness.  Yes, I know...we were all freshman at some point.  Fortunately, until now...no one ever knew it was <i>this</i> bad.</p>
<p>Matt and I went to see Madonna on Sunday!  The Material Girl was truly poised and perfect.  My favorite song had to be the opening "Vouge"...something about the time between the strange visuals and speech about God and hearing Madonna say, "What are you looking at!" that made me just shiver in excitment.  The dancing was amazing, the stage stuff pretty interesting, and Madonna's costumes very unique, though sometimes a bit off.  You know, it's kind of sad, but "American Life" was the best song she did.  It had the most interesting stage transformation, the most intricate stage properties, and the coolest costumes.  Wow, and the song was pretty good...much better than the video fo sho.</p>
<p>Other than Madonna, I had so much fun with the Pad going to Dupont Circle for the D.C. Pride Parade.  I saw the protesters outside the Chinese embassy!  How cool is that?!  Ok, not that cool, but we don't have an embassy in Athens!  The Pride Parade was disturbing...hopefully more disturbing than Atlanta Pride, which is coming up next weekend.  I hope my favorite lesbian will go with me to sit on the lawn :-/</p>
<p>Once again, I'll try to chime in Saturday...I will definitely.  Apologies if it's late.
