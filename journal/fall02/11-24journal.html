<div class="post">
<p>Grrr...I'm feeling very odd tonight.  The end of the semester has finally captured me.  I'm officially pessimistic again...feeling like all that I have to look forward to in the next month and a half is finals, work, and BOREDOM.  Surely, that will also follow this spring, but at least they'll be distractions.  Maybe that's why I didn't feel so good tonight...</p>
<p>So, tonight, I had a very uplifting dinner with some of my closest friends.  I woke up from my nap and Gen called me...it turned out that they were having a big dinner thing at Sonya's apartment...and I sheepishly asked if I could join them.  Of course, this wasn't a problem.  I went over to Gen's and we got some cookies for dessert and then headed to Sonya's.  It was cool to hang out with those girls...I feel that the only way to combat my insecurities is to remember...ALWAYS remember these friends.  They are here for me, always.  Well, we watched <I>Chasing Amy</i> on TV during dinner...it's sad that they had to take out all the fun curse words...that makes the movie so much more fun!  Well...we ate dinner...we had dessert...nothing much to say, really.  Times with my friends are usually not that remarkable...but they make me feel better.  Well, after we got a CD with Gen, Missy and I went back to Mary Lyndon to prepare for our nights out.</p>
<p>I promised Ilya I'd go to Bones with him tonight since we didn't go last night...so that's just what I did.  Not much that I can say about Ilya though...no, seriously!  Well, regarding myself, we got downtown and to Bones...and I just sat on that futon...like I always do...and just felt horrible.  At first, this guy...this really cute guy that I swear was smiling toward me...he sat on the couch next to mine...but I was too much of a chicken shit to talk to him.  He ended up going around with someone else on the dance floor...and I just kinda wished I could have experienced something like that...especially tonight...with someone I didn't know.  I wanted to do something I didn't expect.  Actually, not many people were talking to me...it made me feel boring and uninteresting...it was such a pity party for myself...like I said, pessimism...it's just overwhelming me.  Well, not completly...I'm alright, I just really wanted something tonight...something to keep me guessing.  I didn't get it.  It would have been nice, but it's ok.</p>
<p>A break would be nice.  I know that's what I'm needing right now.  Something to take my focus off what it's been focused on for the last few months.  The last couple of days have been really great, I'm really happy that I'm focusing on different stuff.  It's going to be nice to be back in my home state-of-mind.  I'm not looking forward to living in a home without my mom though...as much as I love my dad, it's going to be seriously unbalanced.  I see myself a month from now dying to get back to Athens...oh, I'll just have to see.  Maybe Target will keep me so busy, I just won't care...</p>
<p>Well, later today, I have that Rainbow Squad meeting...I know...anything with the words "Rainbow" and "Squad" in it has to be fun.  Afterwards, I'm going to make cookies at Sonya's.  Then I'm going to Padmini's Thanksgiving dinner...I'm glad I didn't have to do the meeting tonight so I could have some Turkey with the nicest person I've met this semester.  Well, it's not like Padmini's better then CHARLIE or anything...but that's a whole different story...</p>
<p>I feel very alone tonight...sigh, but that's ok.  I have to get used to this feeling...it's not so bad...I just wish I could talk to someone and experience something different.  Excitment...things have lost that.  They seemed so interesting and new, now they are nothing.  People that I felt so polarized to are suddenly very uninteresting.  It's like I'm seeing alot for the first time, and I'm seeing that things were never that bad for me.  I always had what I wanted.  Well, enough babbling...bed time...well, I'll probably IM people...cause I need to talk to someone...anyone...yawn...goodnight

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, November 26th...12:48AM</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Missy made a comment about the entry above...she said I sounded depressed.  I was kinda troubled by the comment, but understood what she was saying.  Yah, I was alittle down...I think that's natural.  I don't know if anyone noticed, but I wrote at the end of one of my thoughts "It's ok."  That's was just me reassuring anyone that may have cared even slightly about me that I was really alright.  Sure...things happen that bring me down...I accept that.  I embrace that.  I expect that.  I'm a level headed person too...I can deal with it.  I don't think I've ever been in a situation that I couldn't handle...but that doesn't mean it wouldn't arise.  I don't think I'd come here to reveal that...certainly not.  You would know...or you wouldn't know.  I trust my friends would make it their business to know.  Missy has helped me feel very loved, and I appreciate her for it.  I know that if I couldn't handle things, she'd be there for me.  And I'm there for her.</p>
<p>Last night, I went to Thanksgiving potluck with Padmini.  It was a very interesting experience...when I walked in, I didn't know anybody.  I knew Melanie from my Spanish class...that was it.  After Padmini and Charlie showed up, I tried not to cling to them...they were very relaxed in this environment...there was like 20 people...all very close friends...and I felt very much like an outsider...initially.  Of course, being thrusted into a situation like that will make you a bit uneasy, but after a while, I felt very much at ease.  Many of the people made an effort to include me in the situation...I didn't want it to seem like I was mooching for a free dinner.  Well, despite those feelings, it was so cute to see Charlie run triumphantly in with his delicious mashed potatoes.  It turned out that Dessa and him were having a potato cook-off...and judging both of their excellent creations, I have to admit that Charlie's potatoes were more to my liking.  It's too bad Padmini didn't make any potatoes...she probably could have proven herself cooler then the most excellent Charlie...but I guess nobody's perfect...especially Padmini!</p>
<p>As hard as dealing with an actual attentive journal reading audience has been, Padmini and Charlie have made it so much fun!  I was surprised to hear that they were tripping over eachother, counting how many times they were mentioned in the journal to see just which one of them were more important to me.  Padmini was whooping Charlie's butt for a while...but as soon as I wised up to their little game, I stuck Charlie right back in the running.  After all, Charlie most certainly rocks!  So much more then Padmini...though he didn't come to Thanksgiving potluck for Lambda tonight like he said...hopefully everything was alright.</p>
<p>Anyways...today was better then I thought it would be.  Despite my last English paper going to Professor Anderson to be graded, I got a B+...which is adequate and deserved.  I don't think it was an A paper...I wish it was, but it wasn't.  I will have to nail the final...and that will be that.  Grades this semester are turning out to be just as good as my last two semesters at the university.  No matter how bad things have gotten during the semester, I somehow always pull through and avoid the worst-case scenario.  In this case, the best I can do is 3 A's and a B.  I always allow myself one class a semester to get a B in.  Last year, I got a B in SOCI1101 and Bitch Reynold's class...this year, it will be Spanish.  That's good...I don't think I deserve a B in Spanish.  My biggest challenge is securing the A in English...which is still iffy, but I'm optimistic.  Come on, you know I'm the shit...</p>
<p>Despite my growing anxiety over returning to Target...I am accepting it.  A week from now, that will all be over, and I will be working to get the hell out of this place.  It's time things wrapped up and I returned to what it was I came from.  It's time I realized what it's been that I've invested all my time in this semester...it's time to see what exactly I've gotten from all of my efforts.  It's so sad how this whole semester has slipped away from me...it was by far the most fun I've had in my entire life.  I've never felt so loved, I've never felt more needed, I've never felt more alive.  At the same time, I've never felt like I know so little about myself.  Next semester...I need to invest in other things.  I need to work more on my future and less on the now.  I would like to forge some new relationships...fall in love with something.  Garbage gets so old sometimes...but at least it's always there.  That person...that person that's just been bothering me all semester...he doesn't have a name...he's not anybody that you would know.  I've always been curious...ever since alittle over a month ago...were people talking about me?  Did what I refer to as "issues" materialize into some sort of torid unfortunate crush on an unknowing individual?  Maybe...but no, not anymore.  Maybe at some point that was true, but honestly, it had nothing to do with any one person and everything to do with me.  I'm hoping nobody really cared, but I really sense they did.  This will be the last I ever mention it, I hope.  I figure it's good to give it some closing.  Well, that's nothing I've never felt before...it's happen twice to me before...and I thought it would never happen again.  Shows just how clever I am...</p>
<p>Well, I'm thinking if I make any further entries, they will be me bitching about Target, and I apologize.  I'm alright...just bear with me.  Life sucks at home...and I'm a different person.  Give me a call to save me from my misery...I'd appreciate it...it would be nice to have alittle reminder that I have some life outside of those four walls...that would be nice to know...

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, November 27th...Happy Birthday <a href="../../friends/dina.html">Dina</a>!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>So far...being home hasn't been so bad.  Since earlier this week I explored my waxing pessimism, I've decided to title this week "Pessimism."  This is the perfect week to do this.  Target just gets me down...home gets me down.  I can't help it.</p>
<p>I actually went to Target today to see my schedule.  THANKFULLY, I will be working in Electronics all weekend, which is wonderful!  I love Electronics...I feel like I'm doing the best job there.  I'm closing Friday and Saturday...so at least I get to sleep in, but I won't be doing anything all day besides working, so that's very draining...I feel like I'm hollow here.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, I had a really nice time.  I started my night with dinner at Gen's.  She's so amazing, she made me such a delicious dinner.  She made me hamburgers, tater tots, and baked beans...a good ol' American dinner.  I left her place at 7:30 to see Thom and watch Buffy...this is always a joy.  I went back to Gen's to watch the Osbournes, and after this, I went ahead to Kareoke night at Boneshakers.  This was so much fun!  I sang the following songs..."Head Over Heals", "Here Comes The Rain Again", "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun", "Love Shack", "Total Eclipse of the Heart", and "Kentucky Rain."  John, Matt, Shawn, and Greg were there, and we had a really great time.  I didn't leave until 2am, and got back to Marietta around 3:20...pretty quick drive too.  Driving at night is so very soothing...  Well, hopefully I'll be doing kareoke with Missy sometime...Tuesday was meant for her, but she bailed on me, but I soldiered on without her.  Matt said I was the most adorable guy...so it's nice to know that besides the overwhelming pessimistic view of the world I have been noticing, I can still be adorable and have lots of fun.  Sometimes it's more important to have a sense of humor then a doom-and-gloom attitude...cause you can be pessimistic and still have a great time.  Well, I think I'll distract myself elsewhere in this house of mine...Adios people.

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, November 28th...Unhappy Thanksgiving...</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Ok, first though...morbidly pessimistic, right?  Well, I guess I have a right to be...  I think the word for the day is communication.  I feel like I want to scream out and maybe someone will hear me...someone will understand.  Someone will understand what happened today and somebody will understand why I have these horrible few thoughts in my head.  I have a right to be pessimistic.  I should have known my parents would fight, I should have seen it coming.  Why did my intentions get so screwed up?  I just wanted to see my mother...I wanted to have a Thanksgiving.  I wanted to watch my precious Buffy Marathon in peace...have some turkey...maybe even make cookies.  Instead, I feel so empty now...so very hopeless.</p>
<p>The point is never what happened...it's how I feel about what happened.  I wanted to call Missy and tell her about it all...I wanted to have her two inches from my ear, whispering hair-brained solutions to my family issues...but she was out of reach.  She wouldn't have understood the situation, she couldn't have made it better, she wouldn't have saved me...but she would have helped me long enough to stop me from freaking out.  Second thought...the internet...someone there that can help me.  I swear I freaked John out, but I needed to, I needed someone to talk to, anybody, someone to tell about what I was thinking, what was going through my head.  "So Like A Rose"..."So Like A Rose"...  He was there for me, what a good friend.  I always knew that, John's such a good guy, he served his purpose, he an ear in which to speak in, and I felt better after I called him.</p>
<p>Next thought.  Tomorrow...what will tomorrow bring?  Suddenly, things are much more complicated then a miserable eight hours at Target.  God, that seems like a vacation from all of this.  I can't wait to just walk down those halls and let these things die around me...that pure capitalistic, selfish hunger, it's a distraction to get wrapped up in.  I can think of other things besides today.  I can get away.  I can't wait until January...if I can make it until then.</p>
<p>And I think about the nice things about today...the Buffy Marathon, wow, that was fun...sure, I've seen about all I can stand of "Becoming" parts one and two...but I do enjoy watching "Hush"...and I get to take it back to John and let him see...he doesn't watch Buffy that much.  And I think about Spike, from Buffy, and how before I could never understand how he could love Buffy...about how it's just so incredibly impossible that something like that could happen.  She'll never love him, but he still does it, he still pursues that possiblity.  I think of the time he told her he loved her...the exchange they had...he says, "I'm in love with you..."...she says, "You're in love with pain."  Is that how it works?  If I can understand that, does that mean that's how it will work for me?  Is someone going to come along one day, out of the blue, look me in the eye and say, "I've had my eye on you..."  Is that how it happens?  I don't really know, I am just used to this feeling of abandonment.  It's happened with April, and it continues to happen.  I accept it, I welcome it.  In that nice, fluffy place, I am happy too.  To see how he makes her feel, to know the promise of the years for them.  All that fluffy goodness, it's nice, and I walk home alone and go to sleep, wake up, and life goes on.  Not true, I strugged to feel that way.  I strugged to accept it...struggled to realize that I would never have her like I had...like it used to be.  Surely there's something inside of me that someone's going to want to take.  Maybe then I will understand why she's not here anymore...maybe then I'll know why it was such a struggle to understand.</p>
<p>Maybe things will be better.  Things will work themselves out.  Yes, this will happen.  No sobs or cries, I'll be alright.  I'll soldier through, I already have.  There isn't much you can do...if you were really there for me, you'd have already done it...I called Missy, the first one I called...she wasn't there, but she was THERE for me.  I CALLED her.  I knew it wasn't a problem, I hit that green button and went for it, I knew she cared enough for me to excuse it.  Everyone else, in that moment, was nothing...and John, I can come off confusing, rude, and scared, and he understands.  Hopefully, he appreciates this...because I value, love, and respect him too...and he was there for me.  And April...she called me back...and we're going to our lunch tomorrow, possibly very early.  Every year, on that capitalist's holiday, we go, we eat at Golden Corral, and for a moment, things work out.  The Michael Linley's of the world just piss off for a half hour and we're together, like we used to be.  Things are simpler for a time, and then we return to the frey.  She's going to help me tomorrow, and God Bless Her.  Because, I'm strong, I'm weak, and I need to be touched...someone needs to find me, and maybe she can.  Maybe she can save me from these demons..."I feel it closing in / It's falling down and all around me / Falling down..."
