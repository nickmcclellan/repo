<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, October 19th...The best night EVER...one year later</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>It all started in downtown Athens. Leena and I went downtown for some shopping as well as to enjoy the Homecoming Parade. I remember we went to all these crazy retro stores, and we settled on a nice shirt that I thought made her look like a liquor bottle. We went to Junkman's Daughter's Brother to look at some crazy Halloween stuff, and I got a call from my sister. It turned out that Jen was bored and wasn't going to go camping in Allatoona and wanted to come party with me in Athens. I was alittle weirded out about the idea, but what the hell! Why not?</p>
<p>Leena and I sat down to eat at Rocky's and got two pizzas. I had already eaten and Leena was just hoofing it all down. Missy, Gen, and Abbie were coming by in a bit to join us, and we thought it would be funny to put the mostly eaten pizza in front of me. The three girls arrived, and the juxtaposing of the pizza was fairly sucessful. I guess they considered me the resident pig. It was about this time I put forth that we all got together tonight and go to Boneshakers because my sister was coming into town. Of course Missy took this opportunity to corrupt poor Abbie and also get alittle corruption in herself...she decided to head back to Brumby and drink some before going out.</p>
<p>We parted ways after the parade and I went back to my dorm to hang out with Matt waiting for Jen to arrive. In retrospect, I really valued these random times I had with Matt. He went out to get something to drink and I was just kinda waiting for my alcoholic sister to blow into town, and it was kinda the calm before the storm. Well, Jen arrived with Jen, her other alcoholic friend. They had actually already gotten their alcohol and were drinking it on the way...very bad girls! Well, we got in touch with Gen, Abbie, and Missy and decided to meet them out in front of Brumby. It's always funny to see 3 drunk girls stumble out of Brumby...and it's even more fun when one of them is Missy :-)</p>
<p>Because it was a fairly big game weekend, there was a cop sitting at the front of the Russell lot. We thought that peeling out of there with 6 people in the car was probably not a good idea, so we sent Gen across the street to Creswell and intended on picking her up over there away from the cop. Well, we got on the other side, and drunk Gen had dropped her cell phone over in the grass by the cop...grrr! Me, Sober Superman, I went over by the cop and fetched the phone for her. After these, we proceeded downtown.</p>
<p>We got to Boneshakers and ran into Dille and Leena. Leena had a funny exchange with my sister's friend Jen. I wish I could remember the whole thing, but Jen was very drunk and didn't understand what Leena was saying, and at some point she asked if Leena's name was &quot;Dilledo.&quot; Leena responded by saying, &quot;No, my name isn't Dilledo...&quot; Jen said, &quot;You're name is Oreo?&quot;...and Leena, alittle pissed that Jen is so drunk she can't even understand ENGLISH...says, &quot;Yeah, my name is Oreo...that's the name they call me on the corner where I work.&quot; It was so funny!</p>
<p>It was around this time that the drag show started! This was so much fun, they had to move it indoors because it was really chilly outside. We got some good chairs in the front, but I was being the sweet sober guy and offered my chair to Missy. I sat on the floor with Abbie, who was having some emotional issues (she was drinking that night for the first time ever, so that almost always happens...emotional issues...) Well, Missy was getting alittle antsy, and came down to say hey, plopped herself on the floor next to me. Sasha was NOT amused, started singling both me and Missy out, saying that she was gonna blow me or something...and then she advised her not to do it because I probably had a tiny dick...omg, I was so embarrassed! It was so much fun!</p>
<p>Jen's friend Jen's cell phone went off during the show, and Sasha took offense to this too. It was funny, her cell phone had a transparent battery, and it was flashing rainbow colors, and Sasha was curious, asking if Jen was a lesbian. Jen said no, but Sasha said she was probably bisexual or something...it was a neat exchange. Actually, around this time Abbie was feeling kinda sick, so I was running around getting her water and such. We were reading a magazine during Sasha's show, and of course, Sasha took issue with this. It must have been a while before I noticed that she was making fun of us looking through the magazine during her show, cause I looked up and say her staring right at me...omg, it was so funny! Getting made fun of by drag queens is an experience everyone should endure!</p>
<p>Well, the whole point of the night for me was hanging out with Rachel and Co. They actually invited me along with them and I took along with me my own group of friends. When Rachel and all finally arrived, my group of friends kinda splintered and I chatted a while with Rachel. I remember there was this very hot guy Ben, and I was just so into him, and that 
was cool. It was fun talking to Rachel, and I felt very close to her then.</p>
<p>Well, I was alittle worried about my little sister...running around somewhere in the gay bar drunk...I didn't get up to look for her, but I think I was planning on doing so. Well, that was done for me in a way, cause my sister's friend Jen came running out saying, &quot;You're sister's passed out in a ditch outside!&quot; I nearly fell to the ground...WHAT THE FUCK! I ran outside expect to see my sister dying or something, but she was sitting on the wall outside of Bones really wanting to go to sleep. I helped her back to her car and she insisted that she sleep there while I returned to the party. There was no way I was going to leave her to sleep in that car in the middle of Athens so I proceeded to take her back to Russell to sleep. We parked in the far back of the Russell lot, and it was such a chore getting my sister to compose herself to walk up the hill to Russell...not the mention walk past the front desk without getting arrested! Well, thank God, we were able to do it. Matt was still around and was so fucking amazing to sit there and make sure she didn't choke on vomit or anything.</p>
<p>I quickly made my way back downtown and saw that Missy and Gen were having such an amazing time dancing, they didn't even know I was gone. I figured out that Jen had thrown up all over the dance floor...that was very disgusting! Well, it was just about that time to go, so I got my people together and got the hell out of there. After we left, Gen realized that she dropped her keys somewhere at Bones. I told her we'd come back at 2:45 and find them...so we left. I dropped Missy and Abbie off at Brumby and took Jen and Gen to get some bread for my alcoholic sister. We had a neat conversation about me being gay...it was fun.</p>
<p>Got back to Russell, took Jen up to give Jen the bread, and Gen and I went back to Bones to get her keys. We looked for a bit, and I finally found them, Gen was so happy! I felt like the hero, it was great! On our way back to the dorms, I also fixed her cell phone for her, and she was so grateful, she said she'd take me to dinner on Sunday. </p>
<p>Well, the night ended basically with me falling asleep. I didn't make out with any guys. I didn't fuck anybody in some seedy place. I just went out with my close friends and was so happy that they all had a wonderful time. I've had fun nights since then, but nothing quite like this night...</p>
<p>Funny how things happen. One year later, maybe I'm not with all the same people, but I had a fucking amazing time! Well, it all started with tailgating with Missy. She mixed me a fucking awful drink, but of course, EVERCLEAR! I was alittle drunk. Sonya kept calling us, really wanting us to come to the game early, but we were up for taking our time. We actually had a nice time just sitting together talking about stuff...past issues. We talked about times when we were really pissed with each other. We threw the football around...it was fun, a nice time with Missy.</p>
<p>We proceeded to the game and met Sonya. We were drunk, and alittle offensive, so she kinda left us in the stands. The game was pretty uneventful, but Missy sure enjoyed it. We left and went on to my dorm. We needed to sober up before going out to get icecream or lunch...so we kinda goofed around in my room. We opened the window and started making really loud sex noises to all the Alumni walking by. It was really funny!</p>
<p>We felt much more sober and decided to go to Earthfare for lunch. Missy had to go up to her room to get her license, and she walked in on her roommate having sex with her b/f! OMG! I can't believe I missed that! We had fun lunching over that!</p>
<p>Well, after lunch, we took a nap back at my room and woke up to get ready to party at Dessa's apartment party. We forwent a movie with Aiman and Mitchiru to relax the few hours before the party. Around 10:30 we started drinking again. Aiman and Mitchiru came by to join us, and Aiman made me an Amaretto Sour...it was good! John and Andy joined us too...that was fun, John was getting drunk!</p>
<p>We finally made it to the party, and there were tons of people there! I saw Padmini, and we talked about the test. I had some hunch punch, it was good, and I was trying to get Missy to talk to this very cute guy. I spent most of the beginning of the party outside talking to people, it was fun. Well, Aiman pulled me into some random room and :-x Well, after THAT, most of the people were leaving. Missy was really drunk, and she and Aiman started dancing...I don't know, it was a fucking good time! I loved being around all those people. I was great...it helped me take my mind off of issues...</p>
<p>Well, October 19th...one year later...I hope everyone else had as much fun as I did :-)
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Monday, October 21st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Ok, an interesting interaction involving my journal today in the office that kinda troubled me...what I was sorta afraid of, apparently something I said was the subject of some discussion, and I'm not sure what that was supposed to mean...I'm not sure I need to pay much attention to it.</p>
<p>Other then that, I had a nice day. B on my English paper, that's well enough. I want an A though. I'll have to work on that some this week. Wednesday, I plan on seeing <i>Donnie Darko</i> with Vicki and going to a date night with Missy. Wow, my first date night...I get to play str8, what fun! Not much else besides that. Tomorrow night's Buffy is going to be alot of fun! I want to read the Wildfeed Summary, but I won't spoil it for me. It's all about Anya, and any Buffy fan needs to see it. I am glad I get to watch it with Thom...watching it with him will be fun cause we'll both be into it. Well, I'm tired...I have my advising appointment in the morning, that's important. Better get some sleep, right? Adios all!
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, October 22nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I had my advising appointment...10 minutes! It felt so rushed, apparently she felt that I wouldn't be able to register fast enough...it wasn't even an issue though. I'm a bit pissed at Honors right now. I don't feel the more personal attention one bit. Nothing has changed for me at all. It just seems I'm working for some silly sash to wear at graduation.</p>
<p>I just got back from Buffy night at Thom's and studying for the geography test with Yuka. I have to say, ever since Monday, my feeling of impending doom has just grown so much. I don't feel I should explain...maybe I've said too much? If that's possible...I've talked to alot of people about it, which has really helped. I realized that it's not quite as difficult as I thought. Thom made me realize that alot of what I think is going on is all in my head, and I really think I have a problem making that distinction. I'm going to work on it. Until I've resolved some issues, I won't be using anything but the pronoun &quot;it&quot; to describe any of this...</p>
<p>In closing, I just want to say something for my study buddy Yuka. She's really stressing over the Geography test on Thursday when in reality...it's just a test. I think that if she slept on it and developed some confidence, she'd do just fine. Ok, goodnight all!
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, October 23rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Today was a miserable day...it's what I wanted. I went to a very strange place this afternoon, it wasn't a nap. I just lay on my bed, lost in thoughts, and suddenly, I was compelled to write. I wrote a wonderful poem that has more to do with the past then the present. It was like, issues today helped me express what I've really wanted to say. I'm reading it over and over again, trying to find that one part that is bad, and of course, nothing's perfect, but I feel it's so honest, and I use many awesome symbols.</p>
<p>I Donnie Darkoed with Vicki today, and I'm glad she got a good grasp on the movie. We had a nice discussion about it afterward and I sorta solved the Donnie Darko website, which is certainly one of the most interesting movie sites I've ever been to. I sorta skipped my office shift today for the movie, though I honestly thought I would make it...but I some how stuck an extra hour in my day somewhere. Oh well, I went this morning during Daniel's shift, and I guess that's something...though I didn't feel welcomed.</p>
<p>Whatever. That sort of stuff I like. It's too bad that I left early to see my Journalism test grade that wasn't even there. I liked seeing Padmini, she's a very good friend. She's my English/Journalism friend. I didn't realize it until today how cool it's going to be to bitch with her about English classes.</p>
<p>Tonight, I was supposed to go on a Date night with Missy and her sorority, but Missy decided not to go at the last minute. I was happy she did this. I feel so good about just sitting here in my space for a few hours...maybe I'll work on my paper, maybe I'll write a letter to Nicole...maybe I'll just fall asleep and tomorrow will be different. Days like this, I love Missy so much. She has no idea how wonderful it is for me to just go buy a card for her big sister...it just takes me away from whatever stupid shit I'm dealing with.</p>
<p>Well, Monday I decided I have to bring shit-mobile in to get her starter fixed. That's becoming a very annoying problem. It's so embarrassing to keep turning my key over and over again for 5 minutes just to drive up the road to get back to my dorm. Oh well, that's life. I guess it wouldn't be shit-mobile otherwise, right?</p>
<p>Alright all, I think I'll move on to something else. Adios!
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, October 24</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Oddly, I was very tired after my office shift this morning (which wasn't really my shift, but I think I may have to assume it...) Well, things are better today, for some reason. I'm very surface lately...I'm trying not to let my emotions out--at least not at times when it's not appropriate. Last night, I wrote a 6 page letter to Nicole about everything...that was something, I don't think I would have had the patience to sit at my computer and write it. I really wanted to physically write something, it feels so much more permanent. Also, my other journal too. I don't think I wrote in it yesterday besides that poem, but the letter was some sort of venting too.</p>
<p>Today felt like that day last year...I was walking down Baldwin on my way somewhere...and I looked out onto the street. There was no cars, just a few people, walking somewhere. And me. It was cold, and breezy, and just very cloudy, overcast skies. I was listening to &quot;So Like A Rose&quot; on my CD player, and suddenly, a breeze just blew...over my and over everyone. Leaves were just wafting, dancing beautifully to the ground. It was incredibly calming...</p>
<p>I have to study for my test in 30 minutes...I really do, but I want to focus on these feelings, I want to lie in my bed until they just overcome me and I fall asleep and just dream...dream about it all. I said earlier I wish things would just happen, that all this useless potential should just disappear and for there to be movement. I think I'm too much of a coward to do that. Monday I realized just how horrible it felt to realize you're hurting someone, and I don't want to do that. If anyone deserved to be hurt, it's probably me. If any of this is effecting someone, I just hope it doesn't hurt them. I don't want for anything I say to do harm. Though I still hopelessly wish things would happen...I realize it's best for things to stay where they are. I get such a high just to feel...something, anything, and if it isn't that great mysterious something, who cares. It still feels good...</p>
<p>Ok, I'm going to say it! &quot;It&quot; is Vicki, I'm so into Vicki, I can't stop thinking about her! HAHAHA, so you think you know what I'm talking about? Why don't you just ask? On second thought, you had better not... Thom said something cool...&quot;Two words...plausible deniability.&quot; I like that. So until I DISLIKE that, Vicki is the object of my desire...oh, my sweet, wonderful Vicki!</p>
<p>I can't sleep tonight...and for some reason I keep listening to &quot;Spiderwebs&quot; by No Doubt. I don't think it has anything to do with anything, it's just really cool. Tomorrow is Gen's party! I'm going to have some hunch punch with Missy and hopefully I WON'T get pulled into some shady back room...unlike other apartment parties that I've done this, I actually know Gen pretty well and wouldn't want to do ANYTHING in her apartment. I would be plagued by questions all year...&quot;So WHERE exactly did it happen?&quot; I also don't like doing this because I like to be social with people, I don't like to go behind doors to &quot;feel better&quot;, I feel fine outside.</p>
<p>What else to say...I just don't know. I hope this whole &quot;issues&quot; week doesn't fuck up next week like last week did, it's really not that big a deal. I'm dealing with it, and I think I've found a good way to do it. You all shouldn't focus any attention on it, I will be fine. I actually feel really good about things right now. I can probably drift off to sleep now worry free, so maybe I should do that...it is 2:30AM. Maybe I will take a nap tomorrow? Well, I'm at least going to have to convince myself I'll do that when I wake up in the morning, because I won't get up if I don't have some sort of rest to look forward to.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Friday, October 25th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Nah, I don't think I will be napping today. I have to do laundry, grrr... Well, I am sure everything is back to normal. I'm no longer in the mood I've been the whole week. I feel pretty good today. I am really hoping I get an A on my paper this week, but I'm not too optimistic. We don't have a paper next week, so I'm really looking forward to that break. Next week is actually Fall Break, and I have a few things planned.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I am settled on going to Boobutante, that will be fun. Depending on if I get my car worked on Monday, I will leave that night to go home or I will go home in the morning. I guess that would make it Friday, so I will probably be a home body and get really bored, but I will enjoy playing with Lily and Joey. Sigh...I won't be seeing Joey for a very long time...</p>
<p>Well, I am really anxious about hanging out with April on Fall break. I will call her this weekend and set something up. I'm hoping we could go to lunch or something. Though we have spent alot of time apart and I may have been resolved to accepting that we will never be as close as we were before, I still miss her and want to see her. Well, other then that, I am planning on spending time with my mom, who is moving out after my birthday. Let me just say, this is such a WONDERFUL thing to tell your son, &quot;Oh, I'm waiting to move out after your birthday&quot;...I'm like, wow, that's going to be some birthday. My family shit is very fucked up, and I don't like to get into it too much. I really need to spend as much time with her as I can, and my dad won't be around, so I guess that will help. I just want her to know that I love her and support her, and she is very important to me. She's not alone.</p>
<p>Well, then I guess I'll just, I don't know...maybe spend some time with Jen? Marietta is so boring. I wish I could just stay here and go to random places with my friends. I mean, a movie night with Missy would be more fun! And we had some boring movie nights last year...</p>
<p>Tonight, Gen's party. I'm going to go in camo. I hope I look good in my costume and that it's well done. It's kinda lazy, I know, but I wasn't going to spend oodles of money on something, I don't have much cash at all. I had to call my mom and beg for the second half of my allowance because as of now, I have $9.57 to my name, I think... At least the hunch punch will be free tonight, that's going to be so much fun! Yey! I'm getting kinda excited for this. Oh well, I will have to inform all on what occurs.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, October 26th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I choose &quot;Stroke of Luck&quot; for my journal title this week for curious reasons...for some reason, that song is just so appealing this week. I swear, for months, I just can't get into that song, but that song, for this week, is just PERFECT! If you haven't heard &quot;Stroke of Luck&quot;, then you just have to listen to it!</p>
<p>Well, I had a very nice time last night. I knew it was going to be fun when I saw Satan (Meredith's costume) greet us at the door. I got inside and started having some hunch punch, which was very good. The only problem was that once I found the candy they had and started to eat it, it made the hunch punch taste so gross when I had it, ucky! Well, that didn't stop me from drinking it, and of course, I got really tipsy.</p>
<p>After we got Ilya, I think Abbie and her b/f Ryan showed up as well as Sonya and her b/f Brad. I had a nice conversation with Brad on the couch and some random str8 guy insulted my camo and gave me a camo hat...very random. I think at this point I hanged around with Gen's high school friends Lindsay and Erica. They were very sweet. We spent the second half of the party in Gen's room sprawled on the bed or playing on the computer. I got online and harassed people. That was fun, but then I returned to the bed and just kinda snoozed and chatted randomly. I dragged Aiman and Jeremy into the room because I figured they were probably bored out by themselves. At this point, I think I was having a conversation about dental dams and why they are called dental dams...that was funny. And I was saying cunnilingus! That's always fun...and I don't think anyone was offended, so that's good.</p>
<p>Well, after downloading some kick ass songs onto Gen's computer and listening to them really loud (she cut off &quot;Stroke of Luck&quot; for some crappy rap song...my heart was broken), we decided it was time to go. We dropped Jeremy off and then we dropped Missy AND Ilya off...he spent the night with her :-0 Nothing bad happened, I have already done my research. The most amusing part of the night was seeing two owls fall out of a tree in front of the Vet Science building...then sprawled on the lawn having sex. I was like, &quot;OMG, we have to get a closer look!&quot; Aiman pulled the car up to the curb and we got real close, and I heard them whoing like crazy! Then they stopped...stared at us...and then flew off to the roof of Aderhold where I think the felt they could be alone. It was very cool.</p>
<p>Well, that was my night. It was nice, I had fun. My sister isn't coming to Athens tonight, I'm really pissed...I wanted her to come real bad. Now I don't know what I'm going to do tonight. I might just go to Vicki's movie night, that might be fun, but I think I might end up at Boneshakers...I haven't been on a Saturday in a while, so maybe it's about time I returned. Ok, hopefully this journal won't offend anyone...hehe, there's nothing to be afraid of...it's just me.
