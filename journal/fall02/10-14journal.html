<div class="post">
<p>I titled this journal week &quot;Fall Out&quot; based on three lingering issues I'm dealing with from last week. The most obvious would be the DRAMA that occurred on Friday (REALLY not that interesting, I must admit). The next would be my mysterious Epiphany. Finally, just school related stuff (not doing my paper).</p>
<p>Dealt with drama related stuff from Friday. I realized today that my now obvious obsession with drama has nothing to do with my not being involved in it and EVERYTHING to do with me wanting to be involved in it. I'm a closet gossip, I just know. My respect for people just flies out the window when I have something juicy to share about them. It's sad, I know. I am just going to try to get over that, because it's really not worth it. I could give a shit who fucks who behind closed doors (or by the side of the pool :-x).</p>
<p>Ok, I skipped English again, but I felt good about that though. I got to talk to Daniel and gossip about a whole bunch of stuff...THAT'S BAD, I know, but it felt so good. I am committed to writing an A paper this week. I am going to discuss my paper with the TA before I turn it in. I just need some direction, because I'm really lost.</p>
<p>The Lambda meeting was very boring tonight. I got a kick watching Andy fall asleep during the meeting, and I got to lay on Rachel's arm and make her paranoid about gossip I'd heard over the weekend about her. I also organized a dinner at the Grit and was a very good social Lambda member, helping to discourage cliqueiness and allowing people to get to know other people. I was also very brave in eating a very unique dish at The Grit. I also got to talk to Matt, the guy that I think Daniel is dating. He's very nice, and obviously anxious to meet more people, and hopefully I helped him do that.</p>
<p>Wow, nothing interesting happened to me today. I'm sorry, I hope you're not disappointed. Oh well, you should go read Daniel's journal because he's always doing SOMETHING interesting. Hehe. (P.S.: If you want to challenge me at Mario Kart, please do. I would love to play a game with a challenging player).</p>
<p>Ok, one more thing I've decided to write. I am a very cool person, as all know, and I am saying this regarding how I am so willing to talk with any one of my friends through any issues they are having. I am just saying that I would appreciate it if any of my friends would be alittle more perceptive on how I'm feeling. I really think they neglect to look beyond the surface of me, because it's really thin ice in certain places...places I wish they would purge and pull out of me, because sometimes I wish I had help dealing with certain things.

<p align="center">Hooray for you! You are beautifulgarbage, the most recent Garbage album! You are quite sensitive and are coming to grips with events that happened in the past. You may have been hurt in the past but are learning to deal with it. You have very catchy songs that threw some people off at first, but now everyone agrees that you are a masterpiece.</p>
<p align="left">Oh, God! I took another garbage song quiz, and this is how I did on that...</p>

</p>
<p align="center">You are Parade. You can't stand the fakes and wannabes. You're somewhat of an optimist and love living life no matter what. Keep up the attitude, but make sure to watch out for others in your path.</p>
<p>Missy didn't do so well on her test in Organic. I think she handled things really well. I wish I could help. Not much I can do though.</p>
<p>Had an interesting thought. I thought about letting things go. Just falling face forward into whatever it was I was obsessing over the past few weeks. I thought I'd let myself get lost in it and just let the various hangers-on fall to the wayside, lost in the passion. Who cares if I let the walls fall for that brief moment of fresh air, could it happen? Has it ever happened? Could it make me feel better? I don't really know. I think I'm going to sit in my space and wait...wait until someone grabs my hand to take me inside. I would certainly react to that, most definitely. I wonder if he knows that? I wonder if he even cares...</p>
<p>What could that possibly mean? I don't think I want anyone to know. I haven't really told anyone, but I want to tell Missy. Missy would be the only one that I could trust with the key. Until then, it just bothers me.</p>
<p>Is that to telling? I'm not trying to stir up anything (or am I?), I'm just trying to let it out. I want to write something, anything, and I feel better writing that. I feel like I've let something out, it's off my chest. It's a progression instead of a stagnant stillness. Grrr, I am tried, and I still have to read tonight and, as planned, write a paper. Do you think I can do it? I doubt it...but I'll try...

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, October 16th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>What was today? Was today just another one of those days that are swallowed into nothing? One of the most amazing images of oblivion I have ever found would have to be John Milton's description of Death in <i>Paradise Lost</i>. The idea that Death is a formless being with a large, vicious jaw is just so captivating. Just imagining this beast behind us all, stalking us, partaking in our souls when he sees fit, consuming us. We are swallowed down into his gut, lost forever...saved in the end by our Savior, the one who died for our sins.</p>
<p>Was that too much to take? I'm rarely that religious, but that's how I look at things. It's exciting. Was that what happened to today? Is it lost? Is it one of those days that in my final days, I'm going to wish I could live again to the fullest? I don't know. I feel that I did something. I did my laundry. I mulled over my paper topic. I had a very nice nap (the dream involved a very strange individual who was asking me if he could work for me at Target. Apparently I was visiting Target, and this guy was asking if he could work for me sometime. I told him that I had been on leave since mid-August and told him he could work for me sometime during Christmas when I came back...he was cute, I remember that, and wore an interesting blue shirt). I set up a study date with Padmini for Thursday (at Blue Sky, I'm excited about that, I've always wanted to have a study group there). What does that do for me though? Is this just a waste? Should I treat my precious time here with more respect?</p>
<p>I was thinking, or I have been thinking that it's these days I wish I could relive again and again. It's like in that play <i>Our Town</i>, the girl who dies at the end, afterlife is just a bunch of dead people sitting in a cemetery talking about anything but life. They are aloud to relive any day they wish, but most choose not to. The girl, recently dead, questions the &quot;veteran&quot; dead people, and decides to relive the most important days of her life. Days like when her husband proposed to her, the last time she saw her mother. It was in these times she found that though she (knowing she was reliving the moment and realizing how valuable it was) realized that the people around her, the people she loved, their view of the day had not changed. They acted and reacted in the same way they did the first time it happened. It was horrible torture for her to see her mother treating the time in such a normal routine. She eventually returns to the cemetery, hurt and saddened, sitting their for eternity, trying to forget her life.</p>
<p>Is that what will happen to me? Will I come back to this day, some random day, just to relive it, to know what it felt to be normal? I don't know, but I think about these things.</p>
<p>Ok, I hope you enjoyed that. I was trying to be existential. Did it work?</p>
<p>I'm writing my paper, that's good right? Of course it is, I don't know why I would ask you anyways. I'm sitting here listening to &quot;Coffee and T.V.&quot; This song reminds me of junior year. It reminds me of first semester junior year, a most boring time. I had started driving to school and I still worked at Kroger, but I was about to quit. I had to drive my sister to school, and during the times I didn't listen to garbage, I had in either Wierd Al (don't ask), the Buffy soundtrack, or this song.</p>
<p>There is something about &quot;Coffee and T.V.&quot; Maybe it's the video, maybe it's just the laid back catchiness, I dunno. Someone asked me once what song I thought just summed up what LIFE was for me. I couldn't say some garbage song, because they are so varied. I would definitely say that garbage albums are life. There are times of optimism, times of depression, and times when you just want to scream &quot;FUCK OFF&quot; to everyone and &quot;Rip it all to shreads and LET IT GO!&quot; But one song? What song would I choose? &quot;Coffee and T.V. is kinda long, and it just rants on and on at the end &quot;We can start over again...&quot; That's positive right? You can do that? Of course, not on your death bed, but you know what I mean. Life to me is just dodging distractions, keeping your eye on the big picture, and not getting lost along the way. Having that friendly milk carton pick you out of that dirty gutter and take you back to the people you love :-)</p>
<p>I wanted to spill something on here on my whole &quot;savior&quot; motif in some of my poems. I really think that has all changed for me. For the longest time, I had ingrained in my head that there was this one person out there that's supposed to do it for me. I don't believe that anymore. I feel like, kinda what I was saying in &quot;The Garfield Monologue&quot;, that there is no savior. He's inside all of us. We are the ones that save ourselves. We rise above to notion that one man or woman has inside of them everything that is lacking in us. Of course, it's so perfect to find that one guy that you just fall into his arms and you feel whole and loved, but can you tell me when that has happened before? I mean, sure, April and Matt, but come on! They aren't human! I swear, everyone knows April is from Mars, or maybe some dark hole somewhere. I think that if you expect one guy to make things perfect for you, you are setting yourself up for disappointment. You are your only savior, and if you can make it through to the end, you're really amazing. If you end up hand and hand with another hopeless runaway, then you've done it. You've found eachother.

<p>That little shit...so, Aiman stays over last night, and that was fun...uh huh, yah... Well, I'm certainly not telling any of YOU...only Missy gets to know :-) Well, sleeping in my small dorm bed wasn't very cool, I had to ask him to move to the other bed, but he stayed on the floor...I felt kinda bad, but he insisted. I slept very good, and went to lunch with him, and then had to go on to my appointment with my English TA. Because Vanessa drove his car back with her last night, Aiman had to wait in my room while I went to class for her to get back and give it back to him. That little shit...I shouldn't have said a word about how messy my room was and how I needed to clean it, because that little shit cleaned it! OMG, I'm not genuinely upset though. I am just so surprised. He was so sweet to do that.</p>
<p>Ok, so my paper is going to go pretty well. I am hoping that if I heed all the advice from my TA I will get an A this week. I wish I could write more now, but I have to go on a Geography field trip with Yuka. That should be fun (no SERIOUSLY, it won't...but Yuka will be fun). She wants me to help her study next week for our test. She said something about studying every day...and I was like...hmmm, I dunno. I do have stuff I like to do. Well, I'm going to try and be there for her, she needs to get a good grade in the class just as much as I do, so I will try my best for her. Ok, then I will probably have dinner with Yuka and at 8pm tonight I'm going to study at Blue Sky with Padmini. After that, I plan on working more on my paper and hopefully getting a good night's rest. Wish me luck! (Seeing that this is published on a Sunday, I appreciate and after-the-fact wishing me luck)

<div class="post">
<p>Alright, so how about we give this whole &quot;Fall Out&quot; thing some resolution, ok? So, I wrote my English paper. It might not be as long as I wish it was, but it was on 2 pages, and that's what the assignment said. Everything I wrote down in it, especially the last major part, is pure analysis, very well done too. I followed my TA's suggestions very closely. I feel that this will truly be resolved on Monday when I get my grade.</p>
<p>Fall out from my mysterious &quot;Epiphany&quot;? Let's just say I'm not as swept up in what I was dealing with, but I'm still there. I am hoping that maybe if I talk to Missy I'll feel better about things. I plan on having lunch with her at The Grit on Sunday and talk to her about how I'm feeling. I think speaking these things will make me feel better. Since I haven't the courage to write them, I guess telling a trusted friend would be best, right?</p>
<p>What was the last thing? Oh, yah, the drama thing. Big deal, no fall out what-so-ever. Who cares what happened Friday night. All that matters now is what will happen THIS Friday night. I don't think I'll be around to see though, but I'm sure I'll hear about that. Coming Out Ball? Pssft! That's so last week!</p>
<p>Alright, I'm tired, I'm going to take a nap. I hope you all have a wonderful Friday :-) Let me know all about it!

<p>Yes, I decided to upload this just alittle bit early since I'd be over with Aiman tomorrow night, probably won't have time to write an entry later today, so this should work fine. I just wanted to impart my feelings of impending doom...of sudden catastrophe. I'm due, I feel, any day now, I fear. Now, I fall asleep to the sirens of Shirley Manson singing &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;...because sometimes we are selfish, and it just isn't enough...never enough.
