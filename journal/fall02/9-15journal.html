<p>Today, I got to tow my car to get fixed. I actually just got a call from University Tire just a bit ago. It turns out the tire and wheel need to be replaced, and I need to have the frame bent back into place. Grrr...whatever, I think I may need my dad's help with that. I was happy to hear that University Tire did take my car credit card, ah, some relief. Ok, by Friday, this mini-nightmare will be over, and I will be just the same as before. I'm so thankful I wasn't hurt and that I am able to deal with this properly. I don't know what position I would be in if I didn't have the support of my family, especially my father. I just need to get that straight, it is pointless to feel bad about my situation. It could be so much worst.</p>
<p>Not much going on besides that, I didn't go to Ramsey today or yesterday (because of car issues, obviously). I certainly plan on resuming my schedule tomorrow, and I'm not upset that I took a little hiatus. I needed it, just a little. Well, I'm going to go now, I'm entertaining guests in the Lambda Office! Much love all!

<p>Yey! Despite the crappy beginning of my week, it's turned out to be pretty cool. This week, two new garbage songs, &quot;Sex Never Goes Out of Fashion&quot; and &quot;April Tenth&quot; leaked onto the internet. I got them pretty quickly too, which is wonderful! &quot;April Tenth&quot; is actually a very deep song, I foresee really liking this song alot, eventually. It sounds alot like a song I've heard before...I can't think though, it's more of a &quot;talking&quot; song, and the message is very passive, but powerful. &quot;Sex Never Goes Out of Fashion&quot; is just so very cool. As the title suggests, it's about sex, and I must admit, I NEVER thought garbage would ever use a lyric like &quot;honky-tonk&quot; in their music, but alas, it has occurred. Oh well, que sera, sera.</p>
<p>My car is finished! It will only cost about $275...and considering it could have been a much more costly accident, I'm very lucky. I'm very pleased with University Tire and how they handled my repair. They helped me to pay for the entire purchase on my handy &quot;Car Care ONE&quot; card...yey. Whatever, I am just interested in following my Plan B regarding car trouble while I'm in school. The whole nightmare car repair this summer served to (1) establish credit for myself and (2) get me a car repair credit card so that in an emergency, I will be able to take care of myself. I look forward to this afternoon when I get to drive my sweet car back to my parking deck...listening to garbage, I would assume.</p>
<p>This weekend is shaping up to be pretty interesting. Friday, Aiman has told me he will make me dinner. Isn't that sweet! No one has ever made dinner for me before. I think it's very cool. I'm bringing over <i>Red</i> to watch too. I'm looking forward to spending an evening with Aiman as well as watching <i>Red</i> because it is my most favorite movie. On Saturday, it's game day, and I plan on getting quite wasted with Missy while going to the football game. Afterward, I plan on going to a concert with Missy and Aiman at the 40 Watt. The band that's playing is We Are The World Trade Center. This was a pre-9/11 band, so it really has nothing to do with 9/11 at all. I always have fun and interesting weekends, what is up? I swear, it's karma, cause last year, I had some boring Saturday nights.</p>
<p>For those of you who have notice (which I would think would only be me) I added a &quot;disclaimer&quot; type thing on my journal page. Lately, I've felt little bouts of anxiety when I think of people reading my journal...especially people that I write about. I don't understand WHY, because I really do feel like if they asked me about it I would be honest...or even before I write it and publish it, I would be honest. Anyways...it just disturbs me...I'll get over it. When I think about it, no one reads this anyways!

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, September 20th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Oh, an overwhelming force gripped me and has encouraged me to write in my journal today. Despite a lazy week for me, I am confident that next week I will get back on the ball. No more broken cars to get me down! Ok...ok, what's new? I don't know, you ask me!</p>
<p>Ok, well, tonight I'm going over to Aiman's for dinner. He's making me dinner! Can you believe that? I think I'm going to bring him a flower or something before hand...he did the same for me, and it would make him really happy...hehehe, I think I kinda have to. I'm so good at making people happy. Ok, well, we're watching <i>Red</i> as I have mentioned...but since I've mentioned it...I'm going to move on.</p>
<p>Going on an alcohol run with Missy and Gen and I'm gonna get my Everclear! Yey! I will be able to go to the football game without being bored at all! This is excellent. Oh, I don't understand why I'm suddenly gripped with a good mood. It's like, for a moment, I think I'm ok...I shouldn't be upset because I didn't go to the gym. Big deal, it's one day, and I needed to stop spinning for once. If you're heart's not in it, then you shouldn't do it! It's in there somewhere, I just need to get it out somehow. I will, I promise.</p>
<p>Ok, what else! I don't know, I just feel like I want to write and do something creative, and that's what I'm going to do. Ok, well, today was pretty hum-drum, boring. I turned in my English paper, and I think it was very good. I made a very clever tie between the word &quot;suppressed&quot; and &quot;depressed&quot; in my essay...I think the TA will see that I'm a smart guy and give me an A. I deserve an A! The more A's I get will counteract all the sorry dirt grades I keep getting in Spanish. I'm not going to let that get me down, I'm spending much more time studying Spanish this year then I think I ever have. It's a challenge, and I need a challenge!</p>
<p>I'm listening to 80's music and it's pepping me up! I think I should throw in some garbage music and put on something nice looking...that will also cheer me up, I just know it! Ok...now I'm wearing what I'm going to wear tonight. I've chosen to wear the really tight jeans...this could be a mistake. I feel ok with them, but I'm always uncomfortable. I'm also wearing the shirt that Missy and I got at Richs I think...it took us a while, and we looked at so many shirts, and we ended up getting the one I'm wearing now, and it was the first thing we picked up. Just goes to show you that your first instinct is usually the right one. Listening to &quot;When I Grow Up&quot;, if anyone cares!

<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, September 22nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I had yet another interesting weekend. What is up with this, constantly doing something interesting...this is so unlike me. Well, Friday, Aiman made me a DELICIOUS dinner, and just thinking about it now makes me feel so good, because it was excellent! His roommate came back during the evening, and he was being such an ass, he ruined the mood...whatever, it's his apartment, so I was polite, but now I can be mean and just share with the world that I think he's seriously disturbed... Anyways, Aiman and I watched <i>Run Lola Run</i> and had a nice time just laying together in his room. Afterward, the real fun began. We went out to Daniel's apartment party, which was possibly the best night this year...definitely. Ok, here we go...</p>
<p>Started off the evening by inviting Missy and Gen along, since they both didn't have any plans. Of course, since it was a gay apartment party, Missy was out, but Gen was game because she's an open minded person and wanted to socialize and have a good time. NOT that Missy is bad for not going, it's just SHE SHOULD HAVE...but she'll come next time. Ok, well, before picking up Gen (and Ilya, he came along), Aiman wanted to go on an alcohol run with this girl Courtney, and I took the opportunity to get my alcohol too...which was perfect...now I had acquired the alcohol for the Saturday football game. Yey! Ok, so we scooped up Gen and Ilya and headed out to The Reserve to Daniel's apartment. It was so cool, he was such an excellent host, he had cookies and tons of alcohol, it was so great. I gave a $5 tip even though I only had a few cookies and chips. Ok, well, it started off kinda lame, I played some cards with Gen and this nice guy Chris (I stunk up the place, I suck at card games). More people came, and things got more interesting...</p>
<p>Well, Aiman got really drunk, and at one point, I was pulled into the guest room...and I really don't have to tell you what happened...but let's just say I was laughing so much, because it's so archetypical...I was fulfilling the party stereotype...making out in some random bedroom. That was different... Ok, well, alot of cool people were there! I got to see Kristin and Ray make out, and I thought that was so incredibly cute. They are such awesome people. Alex came too, he said he wasn't having such a good time, that's too bad. It got much more interesting, he should have stayed. Alexander and Walter were there, and they actually stayed for a while, and I think they had a nice time. Lindsay...Matt and his b/f...John of course...some girls from the apartment complex, it was a good time!</p>
<p>Well, the most interesting part of the night would HAVE to be how Gen went home with this guy Cyrus. OMG, she was telling me all night that she was having a great time, and it would be the best night ever if she ended up going home with someone. I worked very hard to try to find some str8 boys that she might be interested in. Finally some came over, and they were very cool. I told Matt what Gen was looking for, and he was so funny, he started asking all the str8 boys to make out with Gen...AND THEY DID! She made out with all these guys just as much as a very drunk Aiman was making out with me. Finally, she settles on Cyrus, and we depart. It was very strange, I was trying to leave for a whole hour, and I had to round up my drunken friends and I finally got out of there at 4am. They were making out in the back seat of my car! It was so cool, I was so happy that Gen could meet someone. Missy MISSED OUT!</p>
<p>I dropped Aiman off, and he tried very hard to have me stay the night...but I couldn't, I had early morning plans. Saturday night, however, I did stay the night. Well, before that, I did go out to the I Am The World Trade Center concert. That was very cool. I had an excellent couch seat in the back. Oh, wait! I have completely forgotten my drunken escapades during the day!</p>
<p>Alright, well, I woke up, showered, went to get some tailgating stuff and picked up a very happy Gen and took her to our tailgating area under the South Deck. With alcohol I purchased for us all on Friday night, Missy mixed up some drinks, and I was finally reunited with my Everclear! It was awesome! I got so drunk so fast...it was a blur. We did go to the football game, and I remember a bunch of little things. I remember I peed in a urinal next to a bunch of strange people...I never do that, cause I have stage fright :-O Ok, well, we left the game alittle early cause it was boring. We went to Sonya's b/f's apartment and watched football there. At this point, because I had only got 5 hours of sleep the night before, I was almost passed out on their floor. We finally decided to go, and Missy took me back to my dorm, where I took a sobering 3 hour nap. I woke up and got ready for my night out with Vicki and Aiman.</p>
<p>Went out with Vicki, that was cool. I talked to her and Jeremy during the show. Alex ended up going with us too, he ran into Aiman downtown and was going into the 40 Watt. He seems like a really cool guy, and I mentioned I had a crush on him before, but that's still alittle there, it's just cool to hang out with him. It's not like I'm pursuing anything with him, because I'm happy being with Aiman, but it's like, he's cute, and you want to get to know him. I didn't talk to him very much, but I tried. Whatever, que sera sera, it certainly doesn't bother me. Well, the show was over, Vicki and Co. left and Aiman and I went to the Grill. Finally got back to his place where we had a very affectionate time, it's not like I'm a little slut, and him either, it's just two guys just getting closer and closer...one of these days...I dunno! Hehehe. Ok all, I have to work on a few other webpage related things. I'm going to go. I hope that this was interesting. I named this week The Hydroplaning Incident because that whole accident Sunday really effected my whole week. I didn't go to Ramsey as much as I wish I could have. I'm going to be going back this week, but I think I'm going to take things alittle easier. I've been really exhausted lately, need some down time. Ok, adios folks!
