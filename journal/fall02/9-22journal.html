<p>I have the most amazing news! Choe is moving out of the room! I know, I haven't mentioned him much at all in this journal. The reason being because I was afraid if I shared with the world how god-awful it has been living with him, he would somehow find out, and that would make me such an ass. Things have gotten better since week one when he had the WORST gas problem EVER...but he's just so lame and boring and socially inept, I find it's very hard to respect him. I'm such an asshole for being like that, but I don't know...it's not like people have to earn my respect, it's just they have it just for being people...but if all you ever do is sit on your computer every night and weekend playing with your masturbator toy while doing homework...there is only so much respect you will get from me. Friday...Friday, I will have a single occupancy room for hopefully the remainder of the semester. I am thinking of naming my room &quot;The garbage room&quot;...I dunno.</p>
<p>Not much else has happened today. I finally went back to Ramsey on a regular basis since that whole &quot;hydroplaning incident&quot;...that's cool. I got an English paper back today...and, DAMMIT! The professor graded it, and it was a sorry sight...I thought I wrote a pretty good paper, but APPARENTLY my best efforts were a C+. I like the +, but I despise C's. I am going to up my arsenal on the papers...I'll start writing them on Wednesday night instead of Thursday. This way I can proofread on Thursday.</p>
<p>Not much else...seriously this time! I woke up feeling really ugly, I remember that, but after going to the gym and just looking in the mirror and feeling alittle better, I am alright. Tonight is the Lambda meeting, it's about SEX!!! Oh, wow...sex...that's something huh. &quot;Give her head and you're riding on a sure shot ;-)&quot; Ok, I'm listening to &quot;Sex Never Goes Out of Fashion&quot;...so you must excuse me. Tomorrow I am going to take the EPT test (English Proficiency Test), hopefully. Tomorrow is also the premiere of Buffy...I will be tuning in! Everyone else has to also, or I'm going to hunt you down! Ok, I'm out, adios all!

<p>I've had a very productive couple of days :-) Last night, as I had hoped things would happen, I went to Blue Sky and read my readings for my paper due on Friday. I was a bit of a procrastinator throughout the afternoon, but I did get to a nice place to read, like I wanted to. I found a great place at Blue Sky (well, Blue Sky isn't very quiet, but the atmosphere is very nice to just soak up). I read my short story and also got some background on the topic. It was a very good night, because I also started on my paper. Tonight, I will go back to the library and work on it some more, hopefully getting a very excellent paper.</p>
<p>I continued my productivity with my triumphant return to running! Yes! I was finally able to do my 4 miles without feeling too tired or having to do something in the morning so I couldn't go to Ramsey. I dumped trying to run 4 miles in three circuits, I found that stopping and stretching when I felt tired worked alot better. I was able to do 4 miles comfortably. I also dumped worrying about getting back before 11 or 11:30. I just need to take my time and deal with the crowds at Snelling.</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I had more to write, but I'm tired and bored, and Choe just got back so I'm really very pissed...it's like living with...I don't know how to say it. Ok, all, much love!

<p>Yeah, what is it with my lazy ass on Saturday nights, I'm too lazy to finish my damn journal for the week. I apologize for being so crappy with the journals lately, people that are starting to read them for the first time probably think I'm really boring...I'm not. I wish I had something interesting to write, but I am not sure what that would be. I will try to make this interesting, and maybe you can decide for yourself if you think it's good, ok?</p>
<p>Alright, here goes. What did I do yesterday? In my opinion, I don't think it was that much fun. This is what I would have loved to do. I would have loved to have gone to the game with John and maybe got to hang out afterward. I would have liked to watch <i>Donnie Darko</i> with Missy and maybe Vicki too. After the evening hours melt away into late night, I would have loved to go to Boneshakers with Aiman and some other friends and just see what happens. Maybe ending up at the Grill before going back to Aiman's place would have been nice too. That would be my ideal Saturday night. This is what happened...</p>
<p>I woke up at 11 and talked to my good friend Melissa about some stuff...it was awesome to talk to her (the last time I got to talk to her sober, I had lost my voice, so that was difficult...). Once Missy came around, I showered and got ready to &quot;tailgate.&quot; Tailgating for us consisted of making drinks that tasted like ass on the back trunk of Missy's Mustang. After forcing that shit down my throat, got very honest with Missy about alot of things...also tried to kiss her (unsuccessfully). We walked down to the game and I begged so much to Missy that we leave the boring football game and get some McDonalds...because I had a mad craving for some fries and a cheeseburger. In the middle of the third quarter, was finally able to get Missy moving, and we walked down by the hedges and saw David Greene and Mark Richt talking. I was not that interested, but Missy sure was! Got back to Missy's car, got my McDonalds, and had lunch. Ended up vegging out for most of the evening, which was nice. I got kinda sad that I hadn't heard from Aiman all day, but it turned out that he was with relatives for most of the day, so I was cool with that. I got a message from him that said &quot;Good nite, cutie&quot; and I felt better. Well, Missy had Sonya come over, and they started consuming alcohol. I just sat and watched South Park (I obviously wasn't THAT interested in the evening). Finally, Kristi came down and we got going to the Crew party. Crew is this exercise team that Missy is on, and they had a big apartment party...I told Missy I'd go with her. Drove down to the apartment, and finally got up the nerve to call Aiman...that was nice, he was going to sleep... Well, we were at the Crew party for 20 minutes before they threw everyone out because they ran out of alcohol. Missy got hit on by two ugly guys and me and Sonya just kinda walked around wishing we were somewhere else. We left, discussing where we would go downtown, and it was so funny! Both Sonya and Kristi were much more into going to Boneshakers then Last Call because they wanted to have fun and not get hit on by a bunch of drunk Redneck guys. Missy was pissed...but this time it wasn't just me dragging her to Bones. Well, we all decided to stay in and watch a movie instead of wasting our money. We saw <i>Legally Blone</i> until 3 in the morning, and that was the night. Travis from across the hall saw it with us (his feet smelled so awful, I had to sit up in the loft with Sonya because I just couldn't stand the smell). That was my night.</p>
<p>Do you think it was interesting? Does my night's degree of interest affect how you think of me as a person? Like I would care what anyone thinks anyways, I'm just alittle curious. So I don't run around with drama in my life, does that make me boring? My circle of friends are very interest. I think it's more like a net of friends, I have Missy and Gen at the center. Closer to them are April and Nicole. As you branch out, you run into people like Ilya, John, Vicki, Leena, Dille, Rachel, and so on. I've added alot of newer friends to my little &quot;hammock&quot; of friends. People that I think are really nice include Kristin, Ray, Evan, Daniel, Walter, Katie, Chuck, Milo, Nathan...and so on. I am usually really short with people on the outskirts of the &quot;hammock.&quot; (Aiman is probably pretty close to the center...I'm not sure where boyfriends are in the hammock...maybe they are in the hammock with me!) I try not to involve myself too deeply into their lives because they too have their own core of friends, and I am sure I'm not apart of that. Is that why I don't have to avoid people when I walk around on campus because of &quot;drama&quot; issues? This wasn't always the case. Last year, I couldn't STAND to see Greg around campus, omg, it was like hell just seeing him on the sidewalk from the bus. It was a reminder that he existed in this world, and I just couldn't stand it. I got over that (well, Greg didn't come back, so that helped). I still feel alittle jealous of people that are involved in &quot;drama.&quot; Their lives seem so interesting and fun, I think that I will be more fulfilled if I partake in some of that. I don't do it, but I still have this sort of yearning. Whatever, I realize that people are attracted to me, hopefully, because I'm an honest, nice person, that isn't going to go behind their back and say stuff about them. I don't have alternate motives, my intentions are very upfront and visible. I just can't help but wonder sometimes, can things be more interesting? Maybe I'm just messed up, but I think falling asleep in your boyfriend's arms, unaware of all the &quot;madness&quot; around you, that's just more appealing to me. Despite my &quot;uninteresting&quot; weekend, I think I'm alright. At least I didn't stay in my room and play with my vibrator like my roommate would. I went out, I had fun, and I am still here and sane and happy. If that's uninteresting...then so be it. It makes no difference to me, anyway.
