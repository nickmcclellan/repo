<div class="post">
<p>My first week back has come to an end. Because I seem to be more so adjusted to being home, this week won't be so bad. Plus, there happens to be this pagan gift-giving holiday on Wednesday that may very well score me a Buffy Season 2 DVD. Yah, I keep TELLING everyone that's what I want...and I guess I will find out Wednesday if I get it. It would be nice...Bryant and John are going to wish I never got my Buffy DVD's...cause they are the two I want to watch all the good episodes with :-p</p>
<p>I'm going to bitch about work now, so click the X on the window if you don't want to witness this rant. The good thing that Target is doing for me is they are giving me New Year's Eve off. In fact, what I thought was a bad thing (working overnight the entire time I am home) turns out to be a good thing. Now, on New Year's Eve, I will be adjusted to staying awake overnight. This equates to maximum party-ability. Now I CAN'T WAIT to spend the holiday with Missy and Sonya. OMG, it's going to be so cool seeing them, I can't wait. Well, today wasn't a bad day. We actually scanned the entire night, which, if we did every night, I would be so much happier. Because we did so much of the scanning tonight, when I come in this coming night, we'll probably do alot of stocking. That's going to be a major BITCH. I HATE stocking, it's so boring, and it makes me want to swallow my tounge and chock on it so I don't have to live another minute in that dank dark hell hole. I WANT TO GO BACK TO ATHENS!!!</p>
<p>(Interesting note: The Cranberries, in their song &quot;Zombie&quot;, seem to have sampled The Church's &quot;Under the Milky Way Tonight&quot;) Today, I have to do all my Christmas shopping. Do you think I can do it? I hope I wake up this afternoon in time to run down to Target and pick up a few things. I need to get April something, my dad and sister, maybe my cousin John Paul...but that's basically it. I am getting Matt and Jeremy something special too (Matt, among the only one of my friends in Athens to get me a present, and Jeremy, thoughtfully remembering my birthday). I'll wait to get their gifts after Christmas though. I am staying up rather &quot;late&quot; right now writing this, but I feel the creative juices flowing this morning, so I'm not going to pass up this opportunity.</p>>My dad and sister disappeared mysteriously yesterday afternoon. When I woke up, my dad was driving off somewhere. My sister left shortly after. I spent the afternoon miserable with a cold. Bryant called to inform me he was heading back to Bainbridge...I felt so sick while talking to him, I felt like I needed to vomit...he text messaged me and I told him I was going to take a nap. I didn't wake up until 7pm, so that was a good nap...a nice restful sleep before a grueling overnight, and I felt alot better. I had a bad headache though, &quot;a dull ache and pain.&quot; I took medicine here, and again at work because it wore off. Thank you Mary Sears! My friends at Target are so nice to me. Jeanna told me today that I exist in my own little world, and I'm never mean to anyone, I don't have any intention whatsoever, and that's so true! Everyone says the nicest things about me there. I just want to say, Andrea has been a real bitch this overnight. She's so cold to me, and it's like I can never do anything right, and when she accuses me of something and then finds out I had done nothing, she just moves on without apologizing. What a bitch. Also, this girl Elizabeth freaks me out. I swear she has some sort of crush on me, which is SILLY, I'm sure you know. WTF, someone needs to tell that girl to get a clue. Tonight, she was bragging that she had a date for New Year's and that she shouldn't have wasted her 20's on &quot;priorities.&quot; Whatever, girl, NO ONE CARES!</p>
<p>On the way to and from work, I listened to the live verson of &quot;Stroke of Luck&quot; over and over again...for several reasons. None of them have to do with how I was feeling a few months back when I titled my journal &quot;Stroke of Luck.&quot; While that whole ordeal was moreso the &quot;devil's claws&quot; part of the song, I think the feelings I was focusing on were the &quot;gift from God&quot; part. Also, you can hear Shirley's accent SO well in the song, I loved singing ever verse to myself in my car with that beautiful Scottish curl. I love the beginning of the version too...Shirley says, &quot;This is for all the boys out there who never get any head...&quot; It makes me laugh! Hehehe, poor boys, huh. When I pulled into my driveway this morning, I switched the song to the live version of &quot;Trip My Wire.&quot; Shirl says at the beginning of that song, &quot;It's all about being a lady in a man's world...&quot; What's up with that, huh? I'll probably repeat that one over and over on my way back to work tonight. One more night! I get Christmas Eve all to myself, yey! (Did you know that the day before Christmas Eve, generally called Christmas Eve Eve, is sometimes called Christmas Ebe? Bryant informed me to this fact early this morning...he's so adorable :-) I plan on hopefully working on my website during the day before Christmas, I have that update, you know...like anyone cares! Well, at least I do.</p>
<p>Ok, I hope my adoring public enjoys this entry, it's everything I wanted it to be (except I didn't bitch about my squabbling parents, but I'll save that for another time...because anything that involves my father telling me I'm going to have to pack up my room by the first of the year to move out of the house into an apartment sharing a master bedroom with HIM HAS to be interesting, right?) Well, mull over every little crevace, ok? Make sure you get every hidden little message, because there are lots of them! Whatever, no there's not...at least Bryant will read it...maybe he'll smile...then I will be happy too :-)

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, December 25th...Merry Christmas!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Another Christmas has come and gone. This one wasn't so bad, my dad wins for getting me the most interesting present...a one hour massage at this place in downtown Marietta. As I saw unwrapped in the living room days before today, my sister got me a Simpsons Rubik's Cube and a Simpson's Magic 8 Ball. I solved the Rubik's cube! It was awesome, I really had it mixed up too. I went over the my Aunt's house and had Christmas dinner. My sister, my cousin, and I all had fun reminiscing on our camping trip this summer. They also pointed out to me something I forgot about Christmas last year...when we were having dinner, I choked on a piece of turkey in front of EVERYONE...it was really disgusting, but they remembered...I try to repress stuff like that.</p>
<p>Interesting note about my sister...she's a lying sack of shit. I swear, she's so secretive about her life, it's like she's afraid to expose anything, she's such a coward. I wanted to leave my Aunt's house to go home and sleep. I was tired because I've been working overnights and wasn't adjusted to days quite yet. We came over in her car and my dad's car, and my sister was going to see a movie with my cousin, so I suggested that I take her car back, Laura take my sister over to the movie, come back to my Aunt's, and her and Dad drive back in his car. This was a PROBLEM for her for some reason, she refused to drive back a short distance to my Aunt's to drop Laura off...she had this issue with saving on gas, which is ridiculous! Anyways, after she realized that she had no right to make me stay, she decided to drive me back and then meet Laura at the movie. I know she had some plans after the movie, and even if she didn't...there are things about her that are just off. I don't have anything to hide, I don't know why she has to conceal so much.</p>
<p>I'm listening to the Yoshimi CD by The Flaming Lips, my present from April. She got me The Flaming Lips CD and My Bloody Valentine CD...she's so awesome! I haven't heard the Bloody Valentine CD yet, but I know they are a major garbage influence, so I'm sure I will enjoy it. She makes very good music suggestions, but I'm not sure I'd really enjoy Modest Mouse, her favorite band. I heard one of their songs and it sampled lyrics from Velvet Underground...I think she was surprised I knew that. I guess I'm not such a music idiot as she thought... On the Yoshimi CD, I really like &quot;One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21&quot; and &quot;In The Morning of the Magicians.&quot; I mean, it's all really off...with lyrics like, &quot;One more robot learns to be / something more than a machine...&quot;, you really have to wonder what that's supposed to mean...</p>
<p>I'm halfway through this break, not much longer before I'm back. I still have a few big things to struggle through, it's far from over. One big obstacle has presented itself...thinking about it fills me with too much dread...but I must deal with it, I will deal with it. Damned circumstances...things are bad, but in times like this, it's best to realize they aren't that bad...and even if they are, they'll get better. There is so much that we all have, don't focus on what you lack, embrace all that you've been blessed with. That's one thing I learned this year. Ok, I'm out...I'll write again soon.

<div class="post">
<p>Things have been kinda stinky since Christmas. At least my impending sense of dread was lifted...I think. It turns out my mom will pay for my car insurance...something I knew I would not be able to do if I went back to Athens. I've also just got off from my 2 days at work after Christmas...they weren't so bad. They were boring, yes, but I didn't have to do stocking in Trim...which is excellent. We've stayed pretty busy and actually stayed until the end of our shifts for a change. Ed says next week's price changes are going to be a bitch, so I will stay busy then too, I know. CAN'T WAIT for the New Year's rave...it's going to cost me $15.</p>
<p>Some special note on my sister...seems she has no respect for my father. She keeps having this guy Sheik over...he's been over every night my dad has been gone...and my dad comes back on Sunday. I'm staying over John's tonight, so God only knows what she'll do tonight. I guess there isn't that much to do in Marietta, huh? Just work and fuck, work and fuck, work and fuck...I bet it gets exhausting.</p>
<p><em>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</em> is absolutley beautiful! It is the most beautiful album I swear I have ever listened to. Last night, before work, I kept listening to &quot;Fight Test&quot; over and over again...the music is just so pretty, and the lyrics are excellent too. I can't wait to share it with my friends...everyone has got to hear this CD! I am going to title my next week's journal after a lyric from &quot;Fight Test&quot;...but I guess I should explain that NEXT WEEK...huh? Well, like I said, tonight I'm going to stay at John's. We're going to watch Buffy DVD's whether he likes it or not, so I had better not hear any complaining. And then we'll probably stay up late and talk about boys! Yey! It's just like the slumber party I never got to have.</p>
<p>That's all for this week...I can't think of any big reason I named this journal &quot;Simple&quot;...I guess now that the week's over, this last part of the week I've felt very much at home. Driving around, I've felt the most detached from Athens as I have for a while...it was nice. Bryant has kept my focus on Athens, as it still remains, but he's been out of town for the last day or two, and I haven't really had a chance to talk to him. This kinda sets me back in my little Marietta world...nothing special. Well, I'm sure I'll talk to him soon...I really miss him, I think about him all the time at work because I'm so bored...there really isn't else to think about...and he's really a good guy to think about. Well...I digress. Simple because of the detachment...and Christmas too, I think. Some song was in my head that had the world &quot;simply&quot; in it...and I thought...I could title my journal with that. I know, I have this sophisticated titling process, don't I? Well, THAT'S all...GOODBYE!
