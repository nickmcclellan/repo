<p>I should probably be sleeping instead of writing in this silly thing, but I wanted to share a few things because I'm a vain asshole and actually think someone might be interested or impressed...hehe. Well, tonight I found out that Terry in Electronics is gay...which I sorta expected, and I was looking forward to working with him tonight so I could figure if that was true or if he had a crush on me or something (he was gazing at me when I had lunch with April on Friday)...and then he just kinda blurts out what I thought of our new Exec...whether he was gay or not. Then he just kinda totally told me he was gay, and I wasn't hiding anything, so I told him I was gay. Hehe...so then I kinda had to hide from him the rest of the night because I wasn't going to be sending him any signals...because that's the last thing I need to do is get involved with a guy at work I barely know or have any desire to get involved with in the first place...but still, it's something to look forward to this Christmas...Ha Ha! Well, working at Target this weekend has really been a pleasure. The first day was rough, but tonight, I got used to it, got back into the swing of things, and ultimately I feel like I can handle 3 weeks. It's just about invoking that part of me that doesn't party all the time and get drunk...Missy and Sonya got drunk tonight, I am so jealous! I wish I could have come to Athens, got wasted, and gone to Boneshakers...GOD I WOULD LOVE TO DO THAT! HAHAHAHA...I'm so rambunctious tonight...and I'm IMing my ex-b/f...wtf...well, bedtime, before I fuck up anything else...goodnight!</p>
<p>P. S.: I think I figured out why I write in this damn thing so much and why I'm always bitching about shit...I seriously have so much time on my hands in Athens, there is nothing much else interesting to do...when I'm home, I could give a shit about this damn journal...so maybe I'll find peace in this whole journal thing over the Christmas break...I sure hope so.

<p>I have always been transfixed by the stars. I find myself, in the most interesting moments, just staring up at the sky, feeling like I can see every piece of heaven. I am walking back to my dorm tonight, and I look up, and I see Orion. I think of when I saw it rising on the horizon, the Earth spinning in that short spance of time, watching it rise in the East...that most pleasant eastern horizon...going home. I saw it tonight, and I moved from Orion to those other nameless stars, the mysteries of the sky. I see one bright and brilliant star, and suddenly I can see hundreds around that one, and still more when I swing around to look up behind me ...they're everywhere! I can't help but see them...and all I want to do is fall to the ground and spend hours exploring the sky ...until finally I can see them all.

<div class="post">
<p>Ok, so I'm here NOW...what am I going to write about tonight...I just don't know! I have been trying to think of something interesting to put down here...so I am just going to ramble for a while...we'll see where I end up.</p>
<p>This week has been a vast improvement from LAST week. Last week, I had a huge freak out with my family. I'm not sure if that was inferred from what I wrote on Thursday last week, but that's what happened. I talked to some people about it, the most helpful being John, I guess...he was the only person I could get in touch with on Thursday to talk to...and I really needed to say something...because I was just freaking out. On Monday, I felt very out of touch. I felt very hollow and empty, like I was just nothing. Not even important. That kinda faded, it's how I typically feel at home...but I swear, it wouldn't have been that bad if I hadn't had that huge freak show with my family...I just felt very cut off...and I hung around the office and went to Lambda and felt better...and I went over to John's that night and watched Buffy...and THAT made me feel much better.</p>
<p>I felt horrible on Monday too because I forged some signature for some Spanish thing...and that made me feel so incredibly guilty...I felt so very bad...I'm sure some people would probably do it in an instant, but not me...I should have done the right thing, and since then I've been paranoid...thinking Mejias is going to ask to talk to me or e-mail me about it...just thinking about it gets me real upset...I went to class today, and she didn't say anything about it, so I guess that's a good sign...I'm such an innocent little guy, I guess.</p>
<p>For my...sigh...last weekend in Athens this year, we're doing SOMETHING for Missy's birthday. I hope it would entail Crazy 80's Dancing...but I don't know of anywhere in Athens that's having an 80's night...last year's Crazy 80's Dancing on her birthday was so amazing...it's the night I met Everclear :-) Well, I will be raising the bottle again this Friday, I hope I can behave myself. I know I was alittle bitch the last time, but this is going to be fun with my close friends, so maybe I'll be a bit more considerate. Saturday, Missy and Sonya are wanting to have a keg party for the game...I wanted to see <em>Ferris Bueler's Day Off</em> at Tate..but I guess a party would be more fun. It would be cool to see Daniel's play...I wanted to see it Sunday and I was sorta looking forward to going alone on Sunday and seeing it...but something about a scheduling conflict...so I won't be seeing it after all...I hope he has a good show though!</p>
<p>Allyson made me a Cure CD this week, and that's been very cool...because I think the Cure is so awesome, and it's been really interesting getting into music I don't usually listen to. I probably should be listening to it now...but I'm listening to what ever few mp3's I have on my computer now.</p>
<p>I'm really tired, I was supposed to take a nap today, but I never made it downstairs from Missy's room. Maybe I should nap for a while tonight...but I don't think I will be able to. I'm going to go to Boneshakers for one last Wednesday in Athens. Maybe it will be as fun and empowering as the last Wednesday...I'm going to try and be more social and dance...I need something to happen, like, anything! I don't really care if it happens before the end of the semester, I don't have much hope for the next week...I'm alittle anxious to leave this place behind. I need a time out...away from everyone...like Nicole says, to reinvest and rebuild. There are some things that I just can't do anymore. For those who can't handle subtle suggestion...I'll spell it out so it's just a bit more obvious...social situations are so complicated now...really, any social situation...so I'm feeling very anti-social, and just need a recharge...and a good month at home can do that for me. Ok, that's all for me...until next time!

<p>I had the most fun time last night at Boneshakers! It was an affirmation, I swear. I went to Bones with Ilya, John, Evan, and Jeremy. We we're going to leave around 11 (like we ALWAYS do...) but apparently John and Evan needed to do some alcohol shopping. I took Ilya over to my place and we waited around for the lil' alcoholics. Finally, we made our way down to Bones...and it was initially such a disappointment! OMG, nobody was there, I sat on the futon in disgust, hearing horrible music and seeing absolutely nobody to dance and have fun with. Well, FINALLY, I heard &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; by The Cure come on, and I jumped up and got to the dancing...it was cool, everyone came along with me...but SOME people were initially really intimidated by an empty dance floor (like EVAN and JOHN)...but they came around.</p>
<p>I was moving and shaking like   nobody's business...it was EXACTLY like Crazy 80's Dancing, but with no alcohol. I was dancing on the flashing lights and everything...it was like a resolution to the alcohol issue I've been dealing with lately. It's not important to me anymore. It's always been completely unnecessary, and that's really cool. I'm really proud that I did all that I did last night without a single drop of Everclear.</p>
<p>Things finally got moving, and Mark played a fairly good mix of retro music they kept me charged and interested in dancing. Finally, the evening got even more interesting...Bryant showed up. I mentioned that I met him the weekend of my birthday, and he was a really cool guy, and since then we have chatted some on the internet, and he IMed me before I left last night about how he was going to Bones and wanted to know if I wanted to come along. I went over and said hey and got back to my dancing. Eventually, he came over to dance with our little group...and it was like everything I had hoped for finally happened...cause Bryant's really cute, and I love dancing with guys that I'm attracted to...just completely out of the blue...it was really cool. We eventually got to dancing alone, just him and me...and he was showing me all these funny dance moves, and I didn't know what I was doing, but I eventually figured it out...I wasn't the LEAD...which is what I can typically do...it's weird following his lead, but it was really cool, because he was very patient with me. Well, I had requested &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; earlier in the evening, and it finally played, and I was dancing with him to it...and it was so cool, I was just really content...and because I was sober, kinda uneasy. I'm fairly certain he likes me, and I know I'm interested in him...I just get sorta scared, like I need to get out while I'm ahead...I need to ask him out or something, because I'm so interested...it just sucks that the buzzer's about to ring on this semester...I would really love another month to continue to explore the possibilties...</p>
<p>Well, because of the wonderful events of last night, I'm afraid this heralds the return of optimistic Nick...no more pessimistic &quot;issues&quot; Nick...let me just say my prayers have been answered! I made the right decision in just venturing out again...just let the issues go...it's rough at first, but stay sane and remember the people that love you...and you'll make it through...well, because I woke Missy up at 3 this morning to tell her all about my night, I kinda owe her a massage...so duty calls! Goodnight...

<div class="post">
<p>I don't want to write much...at all anymore...I always seem to feel weird after I write anything anyways. I'm only going to say that I had a nice time with Missy for her birthday last night. I hanged around with John until he finally went off to hang out with Alex, and then I kinda napped until Missy and Sonya finally came by to get me. I got Missy a Smirnoff Citrus Twist and the <em>Flashdance</em> DVD. We went over to Sonya's and Ilya, Missy, and Sonya all got drunk. We FINALLY ended up going downtown, and went to Molly O'Sheas. This was fun...Missy and I were fooling with Sonya, when she got out of the bathroom, we pretended we were making out...I pulled her on top of me when we were on the floor...it was funny. We finally left, and went back to Sonya's...bad immoral things happened there that I don't want to impart...I stayed the night...we all slept on one big bed...it was interesting, but I'm still tired, so I want to go to bed.</p>
<p>I'm titling this week &quot;Optimism&quot;...because it's been a real good week...and it's too bad that I have to go home leaving so much behind. Well...at least I have something to look forward to...ok, adios people.
