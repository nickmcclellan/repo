<p>I had a disappointing day today. I was supposed to go out with this guy Matt, but things fell through when I felt that my voice was not back 100%...I didn't want to go out with him with a gross sick voice, that just wasn't appropriate. It really sucks cause he's moving back to Ohio and I'm going back to Athens, so even meeting for lunch was fruitless from a long term &quot;fun&quot; point of view, but I was so over that, I am just into meeting a guy for lunch that's cute and interesting, and maybe we can hang out from time to tome when I'm home, but it's like that isn't even possible anymore. Fate just spits on me, and what's most likely now, it's just not meant to be. I think I can accept that, at least I tried, right?</p>
<p>I moved my fridge out of my room and cleaned it up real nice. I left the T.V., fan, room stuff, and clothes inside for now, but most of my electronic stuff is out in my mom's car. I want to have everything out the door by Tuesday so I can enjoy my last day at home...doing WHAT, I don't know. It's not like I can go hang out with April or anything, she is probably busy with Matt, you know, cause when she goes back to school, hours may pass when she's not with him, she's just got to soak up these summer hours when she can, to hell with me, you know? Whatever, I'm over it, I'm miles past April at this point.</p>
<p>After working alittle to get my life back in Athens, I'm feeling just a bit more excited about heading back. It's just the move and all the stress of finding where to park, urg! On top of that, I'm helping out with Lambda's Welcome Week picnic on Thursday, so that's gonna thrust me out into the sun and with a whole lot of people I'm not used to socializing with, it's going to be exhausting, but it's what I need. This semester, I need to work on the things I'm not comfortable with. You know, I have this PLAN, I'm going to do one productive thing every week, and I'm going to Ramsey at least 6 times a week, also I'm going to make sure classes don't go &quot;Reynolds&quot; on me like they did last semester.</p>
<p>Well, I'm exhausted. 4 hours tomorrow at Target, and THAT'S IT. I'm out, until Thanksgiving. Well, I'm going to bed now. Adios amigos.

<p>Still feeling alittle let down that I couldn't go out with Matt...arg! I liked the name Matt...it was so sexy, I don't know why. I'm going to get over this. Tomorrow, I'm going to be miles away from where I am now and just in a completely different place.</p>
<p>Talked to Missy briefly about her move in. She had to take three trips back and forth, that's awful! I'm just one trip, drop the crap off in the room, make my mom take me out one last time, and then I'm off and running. I'm gonna have so much to do when I get to Athens! As opposed to this boring place called home, I will be doing a whole lot of stuff. I HAVE to go to Ramsey, I just have to. It's gotta be a daily thing, I can't let up. I'm going to get fit and buff if it KILLS ME!</p>
<p>I'm really tired now, I can't put up with this journal now. It's 7:44pm and I'm going out for the night, can you believe that?! That will all change tomorrow...UGA HERE I COME!

<p>I've recently woke up from my first night in Mary Lyndon Hall, and I have so much to write about! Unfortunately, it is pretty early, and I may finish this entry a bit later today. I just have to say my room is much smaller then I had hoped it would be. Missy's room is so big! It's about as big as the computer room at my house! I went to Ramsey last night, which is a very good thing. It was not packed at all, surprisingly. I am going to start running tonight. My no-idle resolution seems to be working, but it's only the first full day, so I am weary that I will begin to slip, but I'm going to work hard to make sure that doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Well folks, I'm going to write more later...

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, August 16th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Oh, I finally get an empty room to myself to write in my journal! I swear, Heedok has been on my computer NON-STOP, on MY computer, which is weird for me. He has a computer, but he hasn't hooked it up yet. I'm glad I get to explain what's going on just alittle bit.</p>
<p>Well, the picnic was great! I got to see so many guys that are so hot, it was great, lots of guys I would be interested in. It's going to be great to see this people out and also to see them at the Lambda meetings. Well, there was this one guy, the Greek guy, he wasn't my favorite, but I noted him specifically, he was very cute, he has a b/f, which is so cool, I wish I could have come into UGA with a guy like that, I'm really happy that he's happy, anyways, the guys that were available...ok... Well, this one guy, that shall remain nameless...SO if I end up dating him, THEN I'll reveal his name...well, he was cute, and he said he hasn't dated in a while, and I don't see why, he's so cute, I wish some of these guys are into me, because it's great to meet new people.</p>
<p>I regret not being so open during the picnic. I talked to Rachel alot, which isn't BAD, but I know Rachel, and I should have ventured out to meet more people. I really didn't walk into the picnic trying to talk to different people, so I'm going to work myself to that now. You know, during the meetings, I'm going to try to talk to some more people, I'm going to try to meet more people. I regret missing that opportunity.</p>
<p>Well, moving day was pretty uneventful. Mom and sis dropped me off, I am alone again. Missy had a breakdown today about rush, and it made me feel very bad. In fact, it made me feel bad about a situation I had no control over. I sensed that Missy felt like she was spiraling into a situation that would be very similar to the situation that Rachel and Bill have. I assured her that it wasn't true, but then I realized just how powerless I am to prevent anything like that. She also told me about how her parents belittle me when she goes out with me, and that upset me. I can't help that I'm gay, why do they have to force stereotypes on me? Just because I'm gay doesn't mean me and Missy don't get along or have fun. We have a nice time and I love having a friend like her, I don't know what I'd do without her. She's my ground, someone I can touch down on for balance, she's my sanity, she's always there for me, and I'm always there for her. Why can't they respect me and our friendship? It's very troubling, but I can't change how they feel. I can only do what I do naturally and ultimately prove them wrong.</p>
<p>Grrr, well, I'm over it all. I'm here for Missy and she knows that. I was going to go to see Spider-man at Tate tonight, but I decided to stay in and get some sleep, I'm tired. I idled today, but I didn't idle in a bad way AT ALL. It was a good idle, I got to spend some time with a hall mate. I did my Ramsey, a great workout, and I got my wiring done in my room. It only cost me extra money, grrr. Tomorrow, I don't know WHAT I'm going to do, I think maybe I'll go downtown, maybe get a book at the library. I want to get the Ann Coutier book called <u>Slander</u>. She attacks liberals, and I want to read to book so I can deconstruct the arguments and see if they are flawed. I might learn something! We'll see if I actually follow through...hmmm...adios people!

<div class="post">
<p>What turned out to be a very good day has come to an end. I did alot today. First thing, I woke up and went to Ramsey. Despite some shoe issues I encountered while running, I did an adequate 3 miles running and 200 crunches...this left me with a very warm feeling all over. After Ramsey, I ventured out to Athens with Vicki, Jeremy, and Missy. This was very successful because I scored 2 new garbage posters and also a sticker for my car...Mean People Really Suck. After alittle shopping, I got to have a milk shake at The Grill...for the first time in a while. After that, Missy and I went to take some of her books back. Then we went back to her room to look up movie time and I bitched about roommate woes...and people, there are alot of them. Then we went to see <u>Blue Crush</u>, which was surprisingly entertaining, but ultimately predictable and unremarkable. After this, I parted with Missy and went over to Vicki's to play Trivial Pursuit. I kicked all the Honors kid's butts! It was great! I was so proud of myself.</p>
<p>In closing, this week has been very good. I am on track on my whole plan to stay empowered and positive. I have kept occupied and have gotten a good idea on how I would like this year to go. I've realized that it would be a good idea if I spent less time with Missy, for her sake and mine. I was so afraid that if she got into a sorority that she would grow away from me and I would be replaced somehow (hmmm...maybe this has happened BEFORE...), but that's not the case. We should do things independent from eachother while also coming together for traditional Missy/Nick stuff. I mean, there is nothing wrong with going out once or twice a month with eachother at night but going out mostly with other people. It would be more fitting if we partied with people that introduced us to other people that are more our style. I think it's not fair to drag her to gay clubs because it's pointless for her. At the same time, it's cool to go once and a while on a friends night out. I think that Missy's ready for this and needs it alot, and I think I can stop seeing her as a safety blanket and maybe doing some additional branching off on my own. I could never replace Missy, she's so amazing, and she offers something that a b/f or any other friend could never give me. She offers me Missy, and I can never replace her.</p>
<p>Well, that's enough self-reflection. Come back next week and see what I have to say, adios folks!
