<p>Well, this journal entry is possibly the most interesting of any journal entry I've done.  Ok, let me preface this alittle...</p>
<p>I had all ready a whole perfect week of journal entries...BUT my damn computer got a virus and crashed.  Because I lost every program, including FrontPage, I'm having to do this entry in a primative wordpad file.  This is very odd...no spell check...no background...I'm not even sure it will work.  Well, I'm giving it a try.</p>
<p>Well, I will go more into what happened this week later...I had a birthday, it was nice...blah blah.  I'm going home tomorrow to get some programs I need...like Word.  After I have all that stuff back, I'll have normal journals again...I pondered creating a live journal, but cringed at the idea of falling into the conformist majority...I stand by my feelings about how vain internet journals are, but I say this because I am admitting to it.  I'm guilty of making this some sick little game of what can I write to make people interested.  Like I said, I'm going to really analyze why it is I do this in the first place.</p>
<p>Last night I behaved like a complete idiot.  It has lead me to throw down the bottle for a few weeks.  God, I really need to deal with my feelings in a different way then getting drunk and having fun...it's not going to make me feel better, in fact, I've felt like I was going to throw up all day long.  Disgusting...  I was mean to John last night, and I apologized...but I will admit, there are reasons...drunken reasons based on sober thought, I swear.  I'm an open book people, I don't see why you can't see it already.  Whatever, whatever...ask me if you really want to know, and I might tell you.  But then I might not...oh well.  Despite everything, I feel really bad for being a brat to John.  It won't happen again.</p>
<p>For those that don't know, I broke up with Aiman on Tuesday.  That was hard, but it was the right thing to do.  Seriously, I want to get into this more, but I feel like doing it in my regular Frontpage environment instead on in this strange freaky notepad application.  I'm going to Kronos Quartet with him tonight though, as friends.  I guess things may be akward for a while, but it's for the better, I swear.</p>
<p>Nicole sent me a letter this week, I was very happy to recieve this.  She made alot of really good points to me and made me realize alot.  I told her about my issues and my issues with Aiman, and she suggested that maybe I should take some time out.  She said I should take some time to "fall in love with myself again."  I like that.  I am liking the term "aloof" lately.  I just don't care, seriously.  I really don't.  My life doesn't revolve around whether or not I have a boyfriend, and I'm not looking for a rebound at all.  I like to think I don't need to define myself by the person I'm dating.  I'm pretty level-headed most of the time.  I want to date someone I like...whatever that means.  As far as having a boyfriend, I want to do that with someone I just feel so gravitated to...I don't forsee that happening with anyone I know though.  Sigh...it would be nice, that's the dream, but I'm totally not desperate for it.  I realize that the guy I'm going to fall for will show up eventually...it's just a matter of time.  I have a very big heart, and it will happen.  Until then, I'm just going to enjoy life and stay sane.
