<p>Today marks one month dating Aiman. Last night, I went out to dinner with Evan and Daniel, and Aiman stopped by to give me a present. He made a very special CD for me with alot of very cool tracks...it made me feel so special. I really missed spending time with him this weekend, he makes me feel so good sometimes. There was a point on Friday when I went over to his apartment for just a half hour that I felt so good to be there in his arms, away from the world. It's really cool having a boyfriend. You can share alot of very intimate things that you can't do with regular friends. It's like, when I'm with him, I have a chance to be someone I rarely ever am. It's kinda like my social side and my introverted side become one...I'm letting someone in, and it's a very odd feeling.</p>
<p>This month has been really special. It seems like every weekend I got to do something very special with him. It's not something that I usually divulge to people, it's very personal. It's cool to just keep all that inside. I like how people are surprised when they see me and Aiman together. It's like I'm a completely different person or something. Well, Evan said this to me last night, he said it was weird seeing me all intimate with Aiman...because I seem so much like &quot;Nick&quot;...and &quot;Nick&quot; doesn't do that. I was alittle troubled by this to begin with...because...HELLO! I'm not asexual. But, maybe he meant it like he has never seen me like that before. Maybe he meant that it was strange to see me with my b/f because either he never thought I had one or just thought Aiman and I had been dating for a short time. Nah, he'd be mistaken, because it's been one month.</p>
<p>Well, I am trying to think of something I can do that's special for Aiman. It's really hard because I don't have much money, so it has to be something very special...and I think on Tuesday I might just play some music for him and just be really sweet...I mentioned I'd have to make a CD for him, and I will, but I am not going to do that for the one month. Actually, now that I'm addressing this issue, I can think of so many things I can do for him! Well, I think alot of what I'm thinking will have to wait for some other time. He will just have to be surprised :-)</p>
<p>So, what else is going on? On the school front, I got a B+ on my English paper, the highest grade so far. I'm pretty pleased with that, but I want more A's. Tomorrow, I will read one of the short stories and the other on Wednesday. Hopefully, after reading the second one, I will start on a nice essay...so good, that I will get an A. Wouldn't that be nice.</p>
<p>This weekend, I'm going to go home. I'm looking forward to seeing the pets, but I'm NOT looking forward to witnessing first hand the nastiness that has enveloped my house. My parents are divorcing, finally, after all these years. I feel better about saying that, and I am closer to both of them because of it. I just have to deal with some very deep seeded issues, and that's really intimidating. I plan on returning Sunday afternoon in time for the Lambda Movie Night. Another weekend without Aiman...sigh.</p>
<p>Ok, Lambda meeting tonight, then...well, nothing. I plan on sleeping...alot...and going to the Study Abroad fair tomorrow. Oxford, here I come!

<p>Wow, It's already October. This is so very sad. At this point last year, I had had my falling out with Greg and was becoming very good friends with Missy and Gen. Actually, any day now, it will be one year since that fateful Friday night we all went down to Boneshakers (me, my sister, her friend Jennifer, Missy, Gen, and Abby) and had the best night ever! I have since had better nights, but it's cool. I look back on that time with longing.</p>
<p>I was going to make some phone calls now, but I decided to write in my journal. I don't know why, but I think I know why. I'm so very conflicted lately, I'm like a kid in a candy store. I've been really good these last few weeks. I'm so amazed that something miserable hasn't happened to me. (BTW, that's the cue for my computer to fizzle and die...like last year). I feel like anything that is bad is so far from me. I have so many things to be thankful for. I have such a wonderful boyfriend. I have the most amazing best friend. I am getting to know some really cool people. I'm could give a shit if anyone has issues with me, because I'm just don't care. I don't know, but something seems wrong. Things seem so right, that they must be wrong.</p>
<p>I don't know what I'm saying though. I feel like writing in my real journal for once. Alot of things I have to say I'm not comfortable with sharing with the world. They aren't bad, they just aren't appropriate for everyone to know. I think I'll try that. That will help :-) Ok, goodnight all!

<p>Today, Beautifulgarbage has been out for one year. That's really cool! Last night, amid the myriad of things I was feeling, I felt like I understood what &quot;beautifulgarbage&quot; meant. It's kinda this feeling you get when you're happy, and you feel like it's wrong. You feel like those feelings of misery and depression are just within arms length, but you just can't seem to find them. Just one of my mindless ramblings...</p>
<p>I was really happy to write in my real journal last night. I don't know why I'm mentioning it here, but I think it's because I want people to know I wrote in it...it's something I wish I could write down here...and something I probably would have a few weeks ago, but I'm not going to do it anymore. I still think I would be honest about how I feel if people were perceptive enough to ask, so I guess that's still there.</p>
<p>I feel compelled to write today. I wish I felt compelled to work out, but whatever. I was lazy, and I feel ok about it. I always feel better about going to the Lambda office. It feels really good to see people that I love to be around but I don't necessarily get to see that often.</p>
<p>I got to see Aiman today, briefly. I will probably see him tonight at Boneshakers though. He's funny, he called for the Lambda office number, but he forgot it, so he had to call again. He's cute.</p>
<p>Well, I think I'm going to watch my Dragonball Z now...don't ask...adios all!

<p>Last night was very cool. Went to Boneshakers last night with Aiman and a bunch of other people showed up. It was really funny, because Missy and Sonya went to an 80's social for their sorority, and got really bored, so they called me up. They wanted me to get them some alcohol (the stash is in my room). I was at Boneshakers, so I told them if they came by, I could probably have someone get them drinks. To my surprise, Missy came with Sonya to Boneshakers. They had a really fun time. Aiman got them some drink, I think it was a raspberry something, I don't know, it's not important. Well, she went back to the social briefly, and returned to stay. It was so odd, she actually admitted to me that I was right about sororities. I was right that they were superficial and unnecessary, they she shouldn't have to buy friends because that's really not worth it. I felt kinda bad, because I don't want to be right. I want her sorority to be everything it can possibly be for her. </p>
<p>I guess I don't have much to share today. This weekend is going to be very much &quot;blah&quot; because I'm going home. I wish I could stay here, I would definitely have fun and not have to deal with family issues. Grrr...whatever. I'm going to be ok...I'm going to be ok. Goodbye all.

<div class="post">
<p>I'm at home now. It was very cool to see Lily and Joey, they were both very happy to see me. This divorce at home is really stressing me out. Let me just tell you, I really don't like writing about my family situation, but if you are truly my friend, you will somehow drag all this shit out of me. On Wednesday, Ray just told me, &quot;Let it out...&quot; and I did. I really appreciate her listen to me bitch about my fucked up parents. I don't think she realized how much she did for me at that moment. It was nice to release all that. I didn't release everything though, it was more of a brief geyser of misery, but I would appreciate it if one of my friends played counselor for me...it surely seems like I do that alot for them. This situation especially seems like something I can't get into with people like April or Missy, for some reason...I can't fathom why, whatever. Maybe I appreciated getting to know Ray alittle more because we could bounce stuff off each other like that. Something I mentioned in my other journal that, for some reason, I feel comfortable saying here...I really envy the closeness that Ray and Company have with each other. It's not like I'm jealous or anything, because I too had and still have friends like that, but it feels like I've lost that. Like, I remember when I was forging those relationships, and mine are very different then theirs are. They are different for very good reasons. I have such amazing friends, and they don't hold a torch to that, but then the relationships they are building are the same way. I have nothing like that. It's really nothing I can't eventually get over though. I am a friend to everyone, and though I might not be that best friend to everyone, if they needed me to be, I'm always here. If they choose not to take advantage of that, so be it, but I'm here. I'm a caring person, and hopefully they all know that.</p>
<p>I hope that didn't sound bad, because it's not. These are feelings that I have, and I feel good about putting them here for the world to see because I'm not ashamed of them. I don't see why anyone would be ashamed of their feelings. It's when we are honest about how we feel when we realize just how human we all are. Earlier this week, I started to write in my other journal. It feels odd doing that because those are feelings I don't feel comfortable telling to everyone. I wouldn't say I'm ashamed of them, but I feel that a journal helps you deal with issues. I remember last year when I was dealing with all that Greg shit, my journal was pivotal at giving me the direction toward which I would deal with Greg while not letting his presence here distract me from my happiness. I remember one evening, writing in my journal, having an epiphany. I just didn't care what he thought or whether or not he approved of me. I just didn't care. That basically sums up my attitude toward alot of things. If someone has an opinion of me, I really don't care. I'm very concrete in what I believe and very settled on what I do, and if you have a problem with that, I could really give a shit. Also, something that I've thought alot about lately, is what people think of my intentions. I feel that some people might think I have conflicting intentions, and I really don't care. I'm a very honest person, and my intentions are what they appear to be. I have issues over some of the silliest things, I'm sure you're reading things, wondering what the hell it means or what it's worth, and you just have no idea how important it is to me.</p>
<p>Honestly, I feel like some people might think I have a crush on them and am in some way &quot;pursuing&quot; relationships with them by inviting them places with me, which might just be my crazy notion in my head of what they are thinking, but it is so far from the truth. It is so funny, when I have a crush on someone, I treat them noticeably different. In fact, instead of trying to go out with them at every opportunity, I tend to be very standoffish and scared...because that's just how I am! Of course, every time I see the guy, I just feel so good inside, but you wouldn't be able to see that unless you were really looking. I feel like if a guy I'm crushing really wanted to know if I was crushing him, all he'd have to do would be to look into my eyes and ask. I would definitely fracture and fall apart that instance and it would be blatantly clear. I don't know why I'm confessing that to you, but there it is, take it for what it's worth.</p>
<p>Not sure what else to say. I wish I could be at school enjoying the weekend with friends, but I think the investment I'm making with my family is much more important. Plus, I'm getting a hair cut! Let me tell you the truth though, I really want to go back to school tonight because this DAMN dog won't leave me alone...I mean, can't I get a good hour to myself! COME ON!</p>
<p>P.S.: I titled this journal week &quot;Killing Moon&quot; because I downloaded &quot;Killing Moon&quot; by Echo and the Bunnymen...and I was watching Dragonball...and there was a moon...and I saw the Moon on Wednesday night...so you're just going to have to deal with moons!

<div class="post">
<p>Wow, this is probably the biggest week of journals since my really good weekend a couple of weeks ago. I'm not sure what's so special about this week, nothing really big happened...</p>
<p>Well, I finally got my hair cut. I knew I really needed it. I really hate Hair Cuttery now though. There is this one weird guy that works there and I hate when he cuts my hair. He started going off on a &quot;whitehead&quot; problem he felt I had. I was so disgusted, I mean, what's the last thing you want the person cutting your hair to tell you? Oh, I really think he crossed a line there, and I was not amused. I won't be bringing my business there anymore, that's for damn sure.</p>
<p>I don't have much to say else. I think I had nice dreams last night. I remember waking up feeling really good, but then realizing I had been trusted back into my stressful family situation. Tomorrow, I'll feel better, I am sure. I'll be back in Athens, where my life is alittle less complex.
