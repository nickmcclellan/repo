<p>I probably shouldn't have uploaded my journal early this morning since technically this entry belongs with it...but fuck it, I don't care. I feel like I want to write less in this journal. I don't see why I write in it at all these days. I am too much of a chicken shit to share how I really feel. I mean, I whine about shit not happening and make vain attempts at profound writing, all stemming from this insane notion that someone is actually reading this... I miss the days when I would forget to write in this thing all week long and have to construct some substantive blurp before uploading it (probably sometime late Sunday night...always late). I'm going to make an effort to save up what I want to write about...why the hell does someone need to know the tiny details of my everyday life, you don't care anyways. You'd probably want to hear what I want to tell you instead of what I am too cowardly to even refer to by name. Fuck all of that, things need to change.</p><p>I'm sick of my stupid patterns. I can be so damn obsessive, it makes me want to rip my arms off and beat myself with them. It's not healthy, and it's so boring walking the line between that shadow on the wall and that crazy loon all up in your face. Fuck all of that, right? Who cares anymore? I'm over it...I'm over it...I just keep throwing around in my head the truth...that solid, opaque and unmistakable truth...that pessimistic reality that I've been so afraid to see. It's like an electric fence...it hurts, but it keeps me grounded...keeps me from leaving my mud hole. It's not so bad here. I'm sane here, and I feel like myself.</p>
<p>You don't want to hear all this, do you? What the fuck does it all mean? NOTHING...it means NOTHING, and that's all it should be to anyone, and I will try my best to focus not on that, but on other things...</p>
<p>Today, I did stuff...but I'm not going to share EVERYTHING I did because nobody wants to hear that, right? So true. Well, related to my above blurp of nothingness...I saw April tonight. I spent the evening hours with her at her house, and I told about some stuff...not everything. I told her stuff, she didn't quite understand, but that's ok. I needed some April time. She reminds me of what I came from. We had a nice time, ate some food...she shared some very personal poems with me...poems of a nature I won't share with anyone else. She knows me...and that's refreshing. It's nice to have someone to come home to that still recognizes the things inside that make you who you are.

<p>God, I can't even stop writing even when I resolve not to do it. What do you expect though? I'm an English major. I've been writing my whole life, and nothing's going to stop me.</p>
<p>I still can't get over it...over anything. That opaque and solid truth, just falling down throughout my head, it's under things, I don't want to look at it. I pull it out sometimes...it's scary...but I can't stand but look through it. God, I can't help but excuse my foolish dreams...why can't I just let it die...why do I have to hold tight onto that one chance...it's not love.</p>
<p>I don't know what love is. I won't lie, I've never been in love. God, I could do it though. I could be the most amazing lover. My world just fits so perfectly around that one person...that guy that's just going to know...everything...that's just going to break through every wall. I feel that love is so precious...and lately, I feel like I really do have only a handful of shots to get it right. Am I just going to know or can he just pop up, and I just suddenly, &quot;Ok, yah, I can love you now...&quot;</p>
<p>I watched that episode of Queer as Folk tonight...that one from this summer with Fab Filippo...the one where Brian neglects Justin, and Justin goes to &quot;violin guy&quot; for the song he was promised. Before all of this, that scene...it was just electric, I could feel that. That spontaneous eclectic hunger for someone...I could feel that guy just needed Justin, and he didn't care how he got him, but he just knew that he could. He knew that love was just there, and SNAP, it happened! Well, I also felt so into that scene because Fab Filippo is so hot...I tried to grow alittle facial hair like him this summer...it was a failed attempt...</p>
<p>The glass is half empty, in this case, and I need to get used to that. It's hard though...it's hard when all you want to do is love...and all you want to do is fucking feel SOMETHING...and all you want to do is...SNAP!

<div class="post">
<p>Well, I finally caved and wrote a journal...but I did abstain for a while! I really didn't have much to say...and not much to say now, so I'll get rid of all the worthless &quot;fluff&quot; now...Democrats lost the Senate yesterday...that's scary. I'm over it, it won't effect me. Let the Republicans have their politics, the Democrats need to seriously do something...they're losing it. I finally caved today and downloaded Kylie Minogue's &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;...she's a very cool pop singer! Tonight, I'll do my paper...eventually.</p>
<p>I feel very burnt out lately. I could give a shit about my grades lately, I have established a very good GPA, and it's time to reap the investment...what's a couple of B's going to do, really? So, I don't have a 3.79 anymore...big deal. I'll make it up next semester.</p>
<p>Damnit...I wrote nothing substantive again...I really apologize...I guess I'm just sick of hiding here, so I think I'll go hide somewhere else, goodbye!

<div class="post">
<p>Sigh...I said I wouldn't whine about shit here, but I don't know where else to go. I just am so confused lately, and honestly, just petrified. God, I'm like this hypocrite...I wrote down all this bull-shit about empowerment and how it feels so good to have my feet finally firmly planted on the ground...and I just let that all disappear in an instant...one very odd, spontaneous, and eclectic moment.</p>
<p>That's all I can do now...that's all I can say before I just go insane...because now, I'm going to venture out...I need contact solution, and I think a soothing drive in shit-mobile is as close to the ground as I can get right now...</p>
<p>One thing's for certain...things are going to change...I'm going to make them change...

<p>I'm anxious to send this journal out...I feel if it's uploaded, then I won't feel like I need to write something. I did well at keeping it very lite...I can't communicate how much I am beginning to HATE internet journals. Everyone has one, and it's making us so lazy. We can't even communicate with eachother, we have to write these silly little words down onto some dark corner of the internet just because we are too cowardly to say what we feel. In my own defense, I'll own up to anything I write here...I am never lying. But those are just excuses...I really should just stop, step back, and really think about why I do this in the first place.</p>
<p>Today...well, Friday at least...I turned in my paper, hopefully it will be an A. It was my most dedicated attempt at a paper so far. When I went off to work on it Wednesday night...it was so exciting! I couldn't wait to get out of my room and see Padmini down at Blue Sky and get some hot chocolate...listen to music...just aimlessly writing...for hours. It was nice, and it yielded a pretty good stab at writing. Tonight, I hung out with Gen and watched <i>Panic Room</i>...we both agreed that the robbers and the girls trapped in the panic room were pretty stupid...there were whole stretches of time when the robbers were downstairs nailing doors shut and she could have ran out of that room, got her cell phone, and called the police. She was very very stupid. Gen had drunken and stoned people meandering all over her place, so that was interesting...I had no idea what bongwater was...let alone that there was a movie CALLED <i>Bongwater</i>...but I figured that out tonight, that's for sure.</p>
<p>I talked to Rachel tonight! Wow, that was a conversation I have been dying to have...we talked for a whole hour, it was very cool. That girl is so cool, I don't care what anybody thinks, but there are just times when I can just open up to her about EVERYTHING, and she's not all weirded out or uninterested...she's very empathetic, and she cares. She made me feel very good.</p>
<p>Ok, tomorrow, I think I might be tailgating at some point...that should be fun, but I am thinking Daniel won't call me...which would be cool, because I can probably find something to do, but it is a game weekend, and it would be my first game weekend NOT tailgating and getting just alittle tipsy, so I kinda wanna go. I've never tailgated without Missy before, so maybe this will be new and different. Tomorrow night I'm going to party my ass off at Boneshakers...and I'm not going to walk in with a dime...and everyone better buy me a drink for my birthday, or else I'm going to be all heartbroken...or just a very bitter sober person. Ok, I'm going to go to bed now, goodnight...</p>
<p>P.S.: If you haven't liked to this through my homepage, YOU BETTER...because if you miss my very VERY sad license photo from when I was 15...it's a trip, you have to see it...</p>
<p>P.P.S: Changed the title from &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; to &quot;Silence is Golden&quot;...figured it was more appropriate? Of course I did...
