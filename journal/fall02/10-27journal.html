<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, October 27th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Oh, dear...my Saturday seemed incredibly boring. Was it because Missy went back home? I don't think so... I suppose I could have gone out and done something, but I really didn't want to. I basically got back from Aiman's around 1pm and worked alittle at cleaning my room, and I think I updated my webpage, then I got bored and took a nap. I woke up and watched TV some, I watched the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but I didn't see all of it. That's good, because I hadn't started from the beginning, so now I have a chance to really see it some day. Well, I wrote alittle, and then Aiman called about whether or not we'd go to Boneshakers. I really hadn't heard anything about anyone going to Boneshakers, so that seemed really unappealing. I decided not to go and Aiman came over with a movie Brotherhood of the Wolf and we watched that. It was an interesting movie, very long. I don't think it impacted me as much as it did him.</p>
<p>I think it was a boring weekend because it was an away game weekend...but then again, the South Carolina game weekend wasn't boring, was it? I forget what I did then...I know I saw the game at Gen's and I think I went out with Aiman downtown to Boneshakers...grrr. Why couldn't yesterday be more fun? I would have definitely been something if my sister showed up. She kept saying she MIGHT come this Saturday, but when Saturday rolls around, she says she's got work on Sunday at 2:30. Oh well, it probably wouldn't have been a good day for her to come anyways. The weekend after fall break Sonya is having a party, so hopefully I can get her to come then. I really want to take her to one of my friend's parties. She's been to Boneshakers, and so have I. I want to show her something different.</p>
<p>Well, today...hmmm. I SAY I'm going to work on my Spanish oral presentation that is on November 4th, but I suspect I won't get much done. Fall break is when I plan on really spear-heading that. My topic is &quot;El medio ambiente.&quot; I don't know what I was such a coward that I didn't get a topic on homophobia...I think it's because this guy I know that worked at my Target is in that class, and for some reason, I feel he'll be disappointed I'm gay. I mean, if he ever asked me if I was gay, I'd totally be honest, and I really feel he knows already, but I don't want to be all open about it to the point that I do an oral presentation in Spanish about it.</p>
<p>For dinner, I'm going to 'Tween the Hedges with Gen. This stems from last year when she took me there when I fixed her cell phone and found her keys after our wild night at Boneshakers that Homecoming weekend. She wants to go back there, and I'm sure I'll be hungry and I'll have money, so why not? Signs is playing at Tate, and I could go see that if I'm so inclined, but I don't know anyone who would go with me. And even if I do, I'm always too afraid to ask them...</p>
<p>Ok, now I'll continue my day by looking for more good mp3's...adios people!
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Monday, October 28th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Today, so far, has been pretty good. I mean, I didn't get an A on my paper, and I was just a bit pissed about that, but I know there was alot of good analysis in the paper, and she noted that, so it wasn't a complete failure. Actually, I had a nice moment of anger while walking to my journalism class...I was reading her comments, and then I noticed that the road I was walking on had been ripped up by those damn construction workers...why the HELL do they have to ruin all my routes to class? I was instantly furious, and despite the annoying construction guy asking me to move out of the way, I just kept walking, ignoring him completely, focusing on my paper. It was empowering...they need to quit though, I mean, we don't need this shit!</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to mouth off on something I heard on TV this weekend which was further aggravated this morning in Spanish. Well, regarding the horrible sniper shootings in D.C., people are now contemplating where they will prosecute the case. This horrible man was on the TV, and he said that he hoped that the case will be tried in Virginia because the laws for the death penalty are lax there and they could probably have the juvenile tried as an adult and have him put to death too. I was disgusted...first of all, I am not excusing what these two horrible men did. It was awful and they should atone for their crimes...but where do we, as all-powerful Americans, get the notion that we have a license to kill? Where is it written that if a man kills another man, we should kill the killer. Doesn't the Bible instruct us to turn the other cheek?</p>
<p>I feel that the death penalty is horrendous and out of date. It's just so fucking ridiculous, I would love to see these men spend the rest of their natural lives in a prison, stripped forever of their freedom. If they can't live by the rules of our society, then they just won't live in it. I don't see how we can properly judge when it is appropriate to kill a man, it's unimaginable! It's a crime of rage. The argument that the death penalty encourages violent offenders not to offend is laughable. I think it's time we joined the world on this one...nations around the globe consider our death penalty a serious human rights issue, and I agree. The United States needs to grow up and realize this has gone too far...</p>
<p>What else? Well, I didn't go to 'Tween the Hedges with Gen...that was unfortunate. She wasn't able to make it, so I suckered Vicki into going to Transmetropolitan with me, and we had a very nice conversation. I'm not going to share about what, but it was lightly based on issues from last week, but mostly on issues that her and I share...hehe. After that, endless hours of nothingness it seemed, and then Aiman stopped by to get his watch. It was so cool, when I went to let him in, Missy was coming back too, and that was just so cool! After Angel ended, I went upstairs and chatted with Missy for what seemed like an hour, and it was very cool. I took my other journal up and read her some of my entries from last fall regarding Greg issues, and it was really cute...we had a nice laugh.</p>
<p>Nothing much else...I can't get my car fixed in Athens because University Tire doesn't fix starters. This means I'm going to have to drive back to Marietta Thursday night so I get my car in by Friday morning. I have to have it back before returning...otherwise, how would I get back? The election is a week from tomorrow, and I am pretty sure I'm going to go back home for the morning and vote. If anyone thinks that it is crazy to go all the way back to Marietta to vote, I would love for them to share this with me, I think every voting citizen has a responsibility to vote, and I would only feel privileged to do so. It's going to be fun, I've never voted before. I am going to have to research the candidates some this week so I make an informed decision. I think that's what the meeting tonight is about actually, so maybe that should help? Well, I'm off to do other things, good bye all!</p>
<p>One last thing before I slip off to bed...today was a good day. I feel that whatever I was dealing with last week either never existed or just has been quelled somehow. I stress the fact that it was probably all in my head, and I think it might be true. Things are better, and I'm basically in the same spot I was in a while back. My whole sense of impending doom had nothing to do with last week, and you can interpret it anyway you want, but it's there. I just sense things are going to change, and ultimately for the better, but bumpy in the short term. Whatever, I'll enjoy my little piece of week that I have before Fall Break and not worry about it...

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, October 29th...3:45AM</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Ok, before I go into anything...I just want to say my background on my desktop is so fucking AMAZING...Shirley looks so stripped and beautiful...</p>
<p>Ok, you might ask...why the fuck are you awake at 3:45AM on a Tuesday morning? Well, the most peculiar thing WOKE ME UP at about 2:30. I'm sleeping...soundly, nicely, happily...actually, very pleased with the fact that I probably won't be waking up until 9am...well, anyways...I hear a loud knock on my window...and I'm up, and VERY confused, I'm thinking I'm late for something or that Missy needs in. I go to the side door and, low and behold...Aiman. Very very drunk Aiman...</p>
<p>Ok, suddenly, I'm less confused. I mean, I like seeing him and all, but come on...come on...I'm sleeping, and he's like...&quot;I just stopped by so I could see you...&quot; which I'm just not buying. He's very spontaneous, blah blah...so he's trying to kiss me, and I'm so not into this because, HELLO! He's been drinking! Oh, so gross...I mean, so I can deal with this on a Friday night/Saturday morning, but early Tuesday morning?!? I'm so very very very turned off about this whole experience, but he somehow ends up staying a whole hour. I mean, I think a boundary was broken or something...he really did something that pissed me off...but not in an angry way, just in a confused and troubled...irritable way.</p>
<p>Zero 7's &quot;Destiny&quot; is on MTV2! Yey, at least this late night excursion is worth something... Well, he kept apologizing, and I am not wanting to talk about what he's just done RIGHT NOW when he's all smelly and drunk...and laughing hysterically. I really needed him out of my room, distance...need distance. That's not unreasonable, right? Well, I showered to feel alittle cleaner or something...maybe this is worse then it seems? I feel very very weird...better now, and it's almost like I'm doing the routine I did around 11:30 all over again...trying to get myself board enough to sleep. Fuck...well, I hope this was interesting! It certainly was for me...hmmmm
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, October 31st...HALLOWEEN!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Despite some bruises, I feel so awesome today. I had an amazing time last night! OMG, crazy 80's dancing night could not have been more successful...without Missy I mean. Of course, we didn't strew cones across Finley like last year, you know, with her not being there and all...but I danced to &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;...and that was so much fun! Everclear gave me all the energy I needed to go out on that dance floor and dance all night...Gen was kinda tired though, so we socialized here and there. I think I pulled a severed hand out of the back room door at Boneshakers and gave it to Evan...but I think I may have been being macho or something...SAYING I tore it from the door when he really may have done it...but I guess that's how I get when I've been drinking...but I think I did pull it from the door! I hope he wasn't upset that I was making fun of his favorite jacket...it was Mossimo, and that's Target, and I always make fun of stuff from Target because I have spent so many hours trapped inside those four walls...it's nice to think that all that wasted time was for something, right?</p>
<p>Other then harassing Evan, I think I picked up just about everyone I knew there. I hope I didn't offend anyone...I probably wouldn't appreciate being picked up. I was just having fun though. I didn't pick Kenny up because he asked me not to, and I can respect that.</p>
<p>I debriefed with Gen today at lunch...and I was just alittle troubled with what she said I said to other people...I don't want to say what she thinks I said because I'm choosing to pretend I never said them. Grrr...besides this, my arm hurts. I fell down when I was dancing and scratched it up real good. It feels like Saturday...but I know it's Thursday. That sucks. I am excited about Boobutante tonight, that will be fun! I get to show off my camo, and I look really good in it! Afterwards, probably around 2am, I'm driving home. It's going to be real nice and quiet...no stress...nice.</p>
<p>Oh, I thought it was so cool to see Daniel and Ray last night! Ray was so beautiful, as always, and Daniel was fun, I picked him up, it probably really freaked him out. Kristin was beautiful as well, as always! John didn't come! I would have loved to harass him in my drunken state. Oh, I'm trailing off...I should probably get off this computer...I'm sick of writing. I hope everyone has a nice Halloween! I'll see everyone after Fall Break, adios!
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Friday, November 1st...4:30AM</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I had a very serene drive back to Marietta. It was so cool to go from the crazy Boobutante to the cold, dark, and endless 316. Boobutante was fun, everyone thought I looked good wearing a hat. I haven't given much thought to the concept...but it really makes my head itchy.</p>
<p>I woke up from my nap this evening and went on ahead to Boobutante with Jeremy. Got together with Aiman and Co. at his apartment, then went ahead to this apartment party with a keg (so many apartment parties...) Well, I wasn't drinking tonight, so I ventured to Wal-Mart with Andy and helped him find a costume...I picked out Sponge-Bob Squarepants...and that worked perfectly for him! He was very pleased. We got back downtown and our &quot;posse&quot; had gone ahead to Tasty World, so we met all there. Once I got into Tasty World, I was disappointed to see that not many of the people I wanted to come came. I would have really liked to see Rachel...like last year...but then, last year she wasn't good company. I walked around some, finally settled upstairs at the stairway door, watching the various people walk up in their crazy costumes. Aiman, of course, introduced me to tons of people I will never remember...one of them, known to my now only as &quot;Accident Victim&quot;, had an excellent costume (as, you guessed it! An &quot;Accident Victim!&quot;) He ended up winning the costume contest. Well, once midnight rolled around, we went downstairs to watch the drag show which was, unfortunately, disappointing. Sasha wasn't even there! Some asshole str8 guys were chanting &quot;Tatertot! Tatertot!&quot;, taunting the drag queens to get them to get off the stage so some band named Tatertot could play. The queens did NOT appreciate this...and I feel that if Sasha was around, those guys would probably have been walking out bow-legged or something, because she would have shoved her high heels shoes so far up their asses...I don't even want to comment what that would entail! Well, heeding a phone call from my sister earlier in the evening requesting that I got back to Marietta so I could possibly pick her up at someone's house (cause she was drinking), I left after the drag show. Aiman was upset, I'm sure.</p>
<p>He wanted to &quot;prolong&quot; things by having me follow him to some apartment...I really wasn't up for it. I wanted to go home. Honestly, even if I was drunk, I would really not want to do it...things are less thrilling, unfortunately. It's old. It's not exciting. I told him I didn't appreciate how he does stuff like that...when I want to do something, he usually tries to &quot;diddle&quot; around (I apologize for corny word choice) in order to keep me around...but once is interesting...twice it gets old...third time, I tell him, &quot;I need to go...please let me go...&quot; It must be hard for him. He's so out there and social, he wants me with him, in the spotlight. I'm just not that person. God, I couldn't wait to drive home tonight. It was so fucking relaxing. I listened to Beautifulgarbage all the way through, then finished my final stretch through 285 and 75 with some Version 2.0. I listened to &quot;You Look So Fine&quot; twice, and it was just cool...God, I love that song. I know I must just be tearing Aiman apart by not spending times like tonight with him...but I can't help it if I don't want to...if I just want to go home. Sometimes...it's nice. Last weekend...when we watched the movie...I was bored and it was nice to spend time with him. Tonight...all those people, I don't care about them. I don't care about any other person. I hope he can see that.</p>
<p>I got to see the dog and the cat once I got back. The dog went crazy and has finally trotted off to bed with Mom. Lily is sleeping soundly on my pillow over on my bed. After I finishing indulging my need to write on this machine, I'll probably go entertain her. I have 4 hours maybe before Premier Auto Center opens, then I'll take shit-mobile there to get its starter fixed. I hope a short 4 hour nap is enough...usually if it's shorter then 6 hours, I'll subconsciously ignore or destroy the alarm and sleep late. We are our own worst enemies...this is for sure.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to say...today, I'll probably sleep a good bit. My sister invited me to a haunted house. Maybe I'll go to that? If it costs money, probably not...but what doesn't cost money in Marietta? My mom and I will probably get dinner or something...maybe I'll get my book today. I need a new journal too, I have about 12 pages left in my journal...I've had it since my Senior year of high school...it's going to be weird finishing it. Sigh...I can already feel that familiar sensation of Marietta boredom falling over me. I'll soldier through this. I'll come back on Sunday, and all will be cool again. Ok, goodnight everyone (well, since it's 5AM now...good morning!).
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, November 2nd...12:55AM</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Ok...so I'm a good way into my journal for the evening...and the fucking computer crashed. That's lost folks...I'm not writing it again, it's not here anymore...I said something about something being &quot;ooey-gooey&quot;...something about not telling Missy the &quot;ooey-gooey&quot; details about Wednesday night, and I will do that. Oh, I'm scared my computer is going to crash again...it better not, or I'm going to go psycho! I'm saving after every sentence...HAHA!</p>
<p>Ok...I'm going to write about stuff I didn't write about before...I got a book today! It's called <i>The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things</i>. It is by J. T. Leroy, and it turns out it's a book of short stories. I'm so excited that I'll be reading something that I have a passion for...I'll let any interested readers of this journal know just how good the stories really are.</p>
<p>I saw <i>The Ring</i> with my sister and some of her random friends. John saw it with Evan and some people last week...he said it was scary. I didn't think it was scary. Sure...some parts were alittle strange, but I wasn't surprised with what I saw. I didn't quite understand the ending...I am pretty sure that the point of the film was that in order to not be killed by the tape, you had to show it to someone else...and this somehow involved making a copy of the tape.</p>
<p>I'm sitting her in my room...and my sister is talking to someone in her room...probably on the phone...I could be a bad brother and listen in, but I think I'll let it be...I am curious as to what she's doing though...</p>
<p>Well, I got my car fixed today! Hoorah! Wow, ok, I know that some people have never had the shit-mobile experience, and I am sad to say that experience has been somewhat cheapened because of my efforts today to fix the car. It no longer has problems starting! In fact, when I start it, the sound that the car make is completely different...I didn't think that things would change like that...shit-mobile is very peculiar.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go into how much it cost to fix the car...I was stressing about that earlier, but I'm just going to let it go...I can pay for it this summer...and I'm building credit by paying minimum payments...I can't do anything now, but I will do something. Just letting the interest accrue...that just irks me... I want to do something! Whatever, I will...I will...</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I am going to hopefully wake up fairly early and visit my Target. I hope I get to see April and arrange some sort of afternoon time to hang out. After my time with April, I will spend some more time with my mom. Sunday, I have to work on my Spanish oral presentation...after I have delivered that on Monday, I have my sights set on MY BIRTHDAY!</p>
<p>Yes, the light at the end of the tunnel...I don't know what I want to do for my birthday...I think I'll go to Boneshakers like I did last year...but my friends better pick up my cover and buy me nice drinks. Hopefully my family will get me all the random material things I want. Oh, yes, my birthday is November 10th, btw!</p>
<p>Ok, I think I'm going to go to bed now...well, yeah, I'm tired. Shit...what should I name this week's journal? Something profound...and meaningful...I'm set on borrowing from the song &quot;Home Now&quot; again...Wasted Heart? Just Home Now? Tangibility...that's what it will be...don't know why, it just sounds...nice
