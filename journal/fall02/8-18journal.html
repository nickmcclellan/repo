<div class="post">
<p>Taking this opportunity away from my roommate to do alittle journal writing. At least I've gotten my Ramsey out of the way today. I did 3 miles like yesterday. I think that should be my minimum. Next Saturday, depending if I decide to go to Ramsey, I'd like to try 3.5 miles, and work up to 10K. I would like to do a 10K definitely, maybe next summer. Missy told me this morning that compared to me, she feels lazy. I take that to be good news on my part (though she does keep quite busy). This means my motivation to keep busy seems to be working. It hasn't been a week though, and I want to stay committed to this.</p>
<p>Well, not much has happened this morning, but I shall share what I will be doing today. I'm going to go to Mass for the first time since I was in first grade. Maybe GOOD things will happen afterward, but I doubt it, because I'm a very good Christian, despite not going to church. Before Mass, I need to buy a present for Leena, but I'm CLUELESS what to get. I am going to look at Target. Maybe there is something very nice there. Well, after all that, I will at least be going to Leena's apartment to hang out. I haven't seen her since last semester, so it will be so cool to get to hang out with her for alittle while. I'm concerned that maybe I won't get to see her so much since she's in the apartment, but we'll figure something out. I enjoy any time I can get with Leena.</p>
<p>CAN'T SAY MORE...AFRAID CERTAIN PEOPLE WILL READ THIS AND BE OFFENDED...BUT IF I CAN SAY MORE, I WILL, I PROMISE...BUT NOT NOW...OR MAYBE LATER WHEN THE PROBLEM GETS OUT OF HAND. Let's hope it doesn't. Well, I'm out. Classes start tomorrow. Phase 2 of staying busy and positive begins. I'm going to blow the classes away!</p>
<p>RE-ENTRY!!! Leena wanted me to say something about her most charming get together this evening. I must say, of all of my friends apartments, she has definitely the best one. It has 2 stories and I think each of her roomies has a bathroom. She had cake and I bought her a bulletin board, I hope she liked it. She wanted me to update her website, but I just don't know what to do...I am thinking, maybe I should separate Dille and LeenaK and give them each their own site. I may do that...but later, when I have more time and pictures of each of them. Well, STILL CAN'T TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BUGGING ME...going to bed soon, adios folks!

<div class="post">
<p>Had my first day of classes today. It was pretty &quot;normal eventful&quot;, you know, I stayed busy and positive. I got my books and I did a very good workout at Ramsey. MISSY GOT INTO HER SORORITY! I was very happy for her, to see her romping down the stairs with all of her sorority girls with a smile on her face, I was happy that she was happy. I couldn't help but think that this was so incredibly fake though. It's so fucking stupid that she had to put herself through emotional hell just to be friends with these girls. It's also a shame that this friendship comes with a very high price tag. I am hoping that my qualms about sorority life won't interfere with my relationship with Missy, but I think I will take it one day at a time, and things will come out just fine. It's Missy.</p>
<p>I went to my first Lambda meeting tonight. I think it was nice. I wish I could have met and mingled with more people, but I did the best I could. I felt very odd about the whole ordeal. I just kinda sat there, being very positive and nice, hoping that someone would notice and strike a conversation. Maybe I should have been more talkative myself. But I was, I think I made a good impression. Whatever, I feel that if I go out like this more often, maybe I will become more social and meet more people. It's just disheartening sometimes, I wish I didn't feel depressed about something so silly, but I can't help it. I just would really like to click with someone, because I'm a nice person, and people realize this, but it's just building those new relationships, it's very hard to do. I'm going to go to the Lambda movie night Friday, maybe I will be more social then. I sure hope I will.</p>
<p>I don't really have much else to say. I want to wake up early and do my Ramsey tomorrow. Gotta run my 3 miles. I think i'm doing well, I'm staying motivated. It's really great.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, August 20th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I've gone to all my classes, and I think this semester will be more like my first semester last year. My journalism and geography classes are both very simple and lecture orientated. I've decided that I'm going to be taking my laptop to these. This is fun for me, because since most of the people in the class are too much of chicken-shits, they refuse to break the mold and bring their computers. It's fun to stand out. Plus, I take notes faster and I'm more organized.</p>
<p>It's about 4 in the afternoon, and I wouldn't say I'm idling, I think it's that I'm taking alittle break. I think, in about an hour, I'll go get my last book and also some detergent so I can do my laundry. Tonight, I plan on doing laundry (go figure) and starting to study. GRR, I WAS CONTENT DOING THIS JOURNAL, BUT THAT CHANGED ABOUT TWO MINUTES AGO. Well, I'm alittle anxious to DO SOMETHING FUN, you know, go out and dance and maybe meet other guys. I want to do this so bad, but I don't feel like the opportunity is slipping away from me. I just wish it would hurry up and get here. I feel like I have all this social energy that is just wasted, like I'm sitting in this room wasting my time.</p>
<p>Well, that's enough self-reflection for today. Sorry I didn't get into it that much but SOMETHING THREW ME OFF COURSE. I'll write again...
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, August 21st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Oh, my arms! After a fairly brutal workout at Ramsey, I must admit that my arms are about to fall to pieces. Missy just called and invited me along to Ramsey again, and I think I will go. I don't know, I want to spend some time with her today and also I thought maybe I could get in a few more miles of running. I need to make some headway, you know?</p>
<p>So far, not much has happened. I had a really boring night last night. It was grueling. I did go to the Hall meeting we had at 10pm, which was fairly uneventful. I was pleased to know that I have a better dorm then last year, at least according to people. I know this charming girl Sarah on the 2nd floor as well as a few familiar faces. There is this one guy I saw at the Lambda picnic, I was hoping to talk to him, but I chickened out. Obviously, the problem has been uncovered.</p>
<p>I have a humongous fear of rejection! What can I do about this? I was talking to Tckoy last night about this, and I just don't know what I can do about it. We both resolved on something. She agreed to work on her academic progress and I would work on my socializing with the same sex (as you can see, it's not the OPPOSITE SEX, because I'm GAY, if you have not already noticed). It's something I know I've struggled with for the longest time. It's something that is so big that I can't imagine overcoming it. This does not at all lead me to believe I can't do it. It will take me alot of time to think about it, do some internal counseling. I run the problem through my head a few times, and work on a solution. It works for me, I tend to overcome alot of my problems in this manner. Writing is also a medium for this. Putting my thoughts into word tends to clean out alot of my inner workings and to clear my head.</p>
<p>Ok, guys, the enigma that is ME...hehehe. You might be surprised at the notion. A gay guy has problems talking to guys. I imagine that alot of gay guys struggle with this. You would think, yah, since he's a guy, he must know how to talk to them and he should be having sex ALL THE TIME! This is so far from the truth. When I was little, I ALWAYS had issues relating to guys in my neighborhood or in my elementary school. I don't know why, I just didn't mix well, it was always something I put off. I would make girl friends, and that would tide me over. I spent alot of my time alone and solitary, which is not bad, because I always had a more introverted personality. I've really only had a handful of guy friends, and it was usually under special circumstances. I would have met the guy and just kinda, the stars would align, and I wouldn't be so tripped up over him.</p>
<p>Around middle school/high school, I kinda developed an alter-ego, which would be as close to straight I can get. I would act very laid back, not very talkative, and not at all exuding any fear. That's the key, I found. If you walk around without this whole fear of guys and what they might say to you, you can blend in really well. Actually, I act alot like I'm ignoring people. Well, I would, you know, guys would speak to me, and I would let any sort of relationship develop to a point. A perfect example would be today, in the lunch line, I saw this guy that I related to extremely well in my ENGL1030 class last fall and I deliberately tried to avoid him. It wasn't that I didn't like him, I was just afraid that if he found out I was gay he would be weirded out and wouldn't really feel like speaking to me. I regret having this issue because it prevents me from keeping alot of really cool guy friends</p>
<p>Gay guys. It's like the str8 guy problem, but that much worse. It's the newest thing I've been faced with. I've always had a problem relating to GUYS, now you through in a GUY that I am interested in becoming romantically entwined, and that makes things complicated. My first feeling is of inexperience. I feel like I would not be worth while to date because I am so inexperienced in anything gay. The only way to get over this, I feel, is to date more guys, which leads back to my insecurity about inexperience...CAN'T DATE GUYS IF I AM INSECURE ABOUT BEING INEXPERIENCED! Ok, the second thing that gets me is the whole procedure/what's expected. What is a gay relationship? Is that what I want? Is casual sex going to leave me empty and unfulfilled? If you have answers to these questions, I'd like to know. The third and most daunting obstacle is my fear of rejection. I promise I will go more into this, but Missy has just called, and I will be going back to Ramsey to get my run on. Tootles friends!
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, August 22nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Today...what can I say about today? I nearly had a breakdown with my &quot;staying active&quot; resolution. I was running my miles as planned, and after I completed the second mile, I started the third feeling like I REALLY REALLY wanted to stop. I did stop too, and after I had walked my third lap, I thought, you know, I could stop now and be a sissy and start my spiral toward weight gain, or I can PUSH IT and finish my 3 miles. I kept running, and after I finished, I was glad I had continued. You see, I was having some pains in my legs, that were NOT shin splint related, I can assure you, and I wanted to ease the pain by walking and ultimately stopping. It turned out that my legs were just tired, and after I finished my run, I felt very good, invigorated. It's funny, they MIGHT have been tired since I did a very aggressive weight work out plus 4 miles plus 400 crunches the day before...you think that had anything to do with it?</p>
<p>I had a nice dinner with Missy and Vicki. I think Missy has grown very well into her sorority. I know not much has happened yet, and I'm sure the most sweeping changes are still to come, but I feel like she's got so much more self-esteem because of it. It's still alittle weird though, I feel that she never needed a sorority to be happy, but you know, it doesn't hurt. She went to her movie night, and I hope she gets to know some more girls. Oh! I even encouraged her to talk to the super hot guy from across the hall. His name is Paul and he was in my Spanish class last semester. In fact, I would convince myself to wake up each Tuesday/Thursday in order to see him, but he is str8 so it's really pointless, but still, very nice looking guy. If I get some Missy time this weekend and he happens to be across the hall, I am going to encourage her to ask him out to her crush party on Tuesday. He would be PERFECT for her.</p>
<p>Ok...Nick's lingering issues with rejection. This is rooted very much in how I perceived early str8 relationships of some of my peers. I remember it being 5th grade, and I would see all the early b/f's and g/f's sitting with eachother in the cafeteria, and I would think, &quot;When am I going to have a g/f?&quot; Every year, it seemed, I would think to myself, &quot;Will this be the year? It has to be the year!&quot; I remember my first crush in Kindergarten. Her name was Katie, and on Halloween, we went to the Old Folks home together and I was a California Raisin. Then there was Erica in second grade. She may have actually liked me, or at least she was obnoxious about it. The next crush that stands out is Rebecca in 5th grade into 6th. I actually did something about her. On the 5th grade graduation party night, I wrote her a note confessing that I had a crush on her, and I had my friend Jaimie give it to her while I left, fearful of what she would say to me. I didn't see her until the very next year. She was seated right next to me in Chorus, and I was so nervous to even talk to her. I had actually turned what was once a crush into a mild dislike for her. After Rebecca, there was this other Erica I had a couple week crush over, got over that, and then I moved to Georgia. Not many crushes here. I liked this one girl, Lindsey Moyers...her locker was above me...and then I got really into a crush I had on my 6th grade friend Jaimie, which faded over time. I remember, one day, it was the day of the 6th grade dance, and she asked me if I was going, and I said no. I should have said yes and gone with her...but I was just clueless. Well, my LAST crush was on Audrey Thompson, and I actually asked her to the Junior Prom. She said yes, but later said no, which was devastating...and lead me to admit what I always knew...that I was gay. I think that these &quot;crushes&quot; were not crushes at all. They were just girls I could see myself with because that's the way it was &quot;supposed&quot; to be. It's funny, because the whole time I was having crushes on these girls, I was having crushes on guys too. This one guy, Rusty, in 4th grade...I just didn't know what it was about him that I was so attracted too, I was too young to admit it that I liked him more then I thought. At the time, I couldn't conceive that I could be gay.</p>
<p>Well, how does this fear of rejection weave into my crushes on girls throughout my adolescence? Well, I never pounced on any of these opportunities. I was always too clueless to realize when I had a shot. When I did eventually take a chance, I was rejected...grrr...(well, as it turned out, Audrey went to prom with a pot-head debater that ended up leaving her there...no one told me about it because I had understandably become really pissed off at Audrey...but it was so amazing to her that that BITCH got dumped...hehe). Of course, my most deafening blow with rejection came with Tim.</p>
<p>Oh, a subject I've grown from in leaps and bounds. At first, uncomfortable to even mention it because I thought he might find out in some strange way, I just don't care anymore. I've transcended that sick desire to stay under that boy's charm. Well, anyways, I started speaking to him before I went on my Europe trip Junior year. It was odd, because he would tell me about all the relationships he had, and he even called me, and that was so strange. I was always so nervous and scared talking to him. I thought I was doing something wrong. He told me about this time he was blowing his b/f in a theater and he was kicked out...I had to admit, I was just captivating. He was the closest gay guy that I had ever gotten to. I would never have pushed for meeting, but he insisted, citing that he was really excited about meeting me. At the time, I felt that I looked so incredibly ugly, but I was building up my self esteem enough to stomach a drive to Gwinnett County to give him a shot. I did it. I drove all the way out to Scenic Hwy. and sat in that seat, waiting for him to show up so we could see &quot;The Skulls&quot; sometime after 7. He walked up and sat right next to me and I introduced myself...I was so nervous, it was the most thrilling night of my life. I was finally doing something about my sexuality, and it felt so liberating and electric. We watched the movie, I left, and I was just livid. He thought I was very talkative, and I told him I would love to go out in a couple more weekends (the same night of my Junior Prom). He said maybe. I e-mailed him about it...and e-mail I still have, and I asked him if he'd ever consider becoming more then friends. I said it in a cheesy way...he had to e-mail me back about it to clarify. I was on cloud 9, like he was flirting with me. I admitted that I wanted to be more then friends. The blow. I rushed to the library during lunch to check my mail to see what he had said. And I quote...&quot;Well... I think we should just remain friends :) we can be good friends&quot; My heart dropped, and I instantly jumped to so many conclusions. I thought I was disgusting, ugly, and not worth his time. I was devastated. I had been rejected by the first guy I had any interest in. I spent the whole next summer in Hell. My car died big time, and I began to semi-starve myself. I went to the gym for the first time ever, I lost a whole lot of weight, and walked back into my senior year looking so incredible. I have never been the same since. There was a period after the whole ordeal, even into my freshmen year of college, when I was dying to know, what would Tim think? Would he go out with me now? Would he reject me now? I don't think I'll ever know, and I don't think I need to know. I would be lying if I said that I didn't think about him sometimes. I wonder that, if one day, I come across him, what will he say? I grew away from him in several ways. I actually wrote &quot;Thursday&quot; about the first time he Instant Messaged me after that summer. It was a Thursday, and I was watching &quot;Undressed&quot; of all things, and he popped up, saying &quot;Hey&quot;, and I was instantly taken back to that place, at his mercy, just beaten and dying before him. And I swear, for a couple of days, I considered staying there. Subjecting to myself to more rejection. I decided to walk away, look to the horizon and just leave. That's ultimately my fear. Do I want to risk all that pain and tears again? Am I just going to have my heart handed to me again? Am I still what I was to him then, pathetic and unworthy? This is my issue. How would you deal with it?</p>
<p>Sigh, that took alot out of me, I sure hope it was worth your time. I want to know what you think about it, do you know how personal that used to be? I can't imagine that a year ago I would have told anyone besides April or Missy about it. Well, I'm going to keep going...I need to think about this all for bit. How do I move on from that. Sitting her now, I realize that's the gist of my problem. He's keeping me from ever taking another show with another guy. I'm afraid I'm just going to lose it again and be miserable. I feel like maybe I should take the chance. I need to talk to other guys and I need to build up my confidence. It's tough, you know, but we all have issues. We can't hide behind these issues and use them as some sort of excuse not to live our lives. We have to face them and overcome them, or live useless, boring lives. I'm going to do it, I'm going to psych myself up tomorrow into building up courage to talk to some of these guys. I'm going to do it...yes, I'm not going to be scared...we'll just have to see how it turns out. Ok, I've got to write an English paper now. I'll catch you all later!
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Friday, August 23rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Wow, can you believe that I have written in this dang thing for almost 7 days straight? Can anyone guess why? Well, I am usually really website active if I am pumping full of creative energy. This is so wonderful too, because I'm so positive and energetic in these times. It's really sad though, cause these times don't tend to last very long. I'm so worried that in a week or so I'm going to get lazy and take a nose dive from all the headway I'm making from working out and school. How do I prevent a loss of drive? Is it something I have to push my way through? At this point, at least sometime today, I was waiting for the bus, and when it pulled off and started taking me to Ramsey, I was alittle excited to be going. It's fun, it really is. It's such an amazing feeling to walk out of that place knowing that you made the most of your time there.</p>
<p>Lambda movie night is TONIGHT! I'm somewhat excited, you know, I have to get myself prepared to work through some of my issues in order to talk to some of these guys. I am hoping that I can talk to some guys and maybe not be so nervous and not have to have a security blanket with me...someone like Missy or Rachel. I feel so at ease around them, but that sense of security holds me back from taking risks that may end up being very fruitful. I know I can do something about this. The other extreme of the situation is when I am by myself in a situation where other guys are present that I'm interested in, I tend to get really nice and quiet...wait for them to talk to me...and then if and when they do, I am really minimal with it. I don't socialize really well I guess. I'm going to try though! I'm not going to let my insecurities lock me away, I'm going to take a chance and just say, &quot;Hi, how are you...do you like the movie?&quot; I really pray that I can follow through on this. Say a prayer for me, if anyone is reading this, alright? Maybe things will be alright for me...
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, August 24th...4:37 am</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>On Friday afternoon, after I finished my journal, I settled on the title &quot;Falling into Place.&quot; The appropriateness of that title didn't fully materialize until about 2:45 tonight. I just had the most amazing night this semester, so far, of course! Sit back folks, and let me spin a tale on how I got around my issues to have a fucking amazing time with no regrets...</p>
<p>First of all, I must thank GOD for helping me get through this night. I truly believe that the efforts I'm making to complete my spirituality is aiding in my social endeavors. Ok, it started, of course, yesterday afternoon when me and John went to go get the movies for movie night. This was a pretty boring task, it was hot, I felt gross and disgusting, it wasn't pleasant. Well, we got back to Reed and dropped off the movies, went to O-house for dinner (where I saw a whole lot of people, it was strange, I'm oddly popular). Well, after O-house, we got AIMEN (remember Aimen) and went to the movie night. This is when I hit possibly the bottom for the night.</p>
<p>I realized my whole working through my issues, that was worthless. They won't go away, they are always there, and I can only accept that they are there and that shapes my personality. If I don't feel comfortable conversing with guys I barely know, I can't help that. I talked alittle to this guy Andy, who I thought was so my type, but I think I'll save that for later...you know, when I get to know him better maybe. Ok, movie night...I was interested in this guy Nathan, who unfortunately wasn't too interested in me, who cares, you know? Well, also this guy Alex, who I think is really hot. Ok, we watched the movies, and John asked, &quot;Who wants to go to Boneshakers?&quot; I went of course, and all you really need to know that came was John, Aimen, Alex, Nathan, and this other guy whose name I forgot. Well, Boneshakers was having this all male review, which SUCKED, I hated it. Well, it was cool cause I got to sit next to Andy for a while, that was cool. The best stuff happened when we all went in to dance. I really think I shined at dancing. I actually got to doing the &quot;bad&quot; dancing with Aimen, which was great. This sorta attracted, I THINK, Nathan and Alex, seeing that I was more then a wallflower, and I could dance and be hot and sexy and everything. I didn't get that Nathan wanted to dance with me, I just kinda smiled, he didn't send me the right signs. Well, Alex gets kinda close, and I SWEAR, for the longest time, I couldn't tell if he was dancing with me or dancing close to me. Well, when &quot;We're In Heaven&quot; by D. J. Sammy came on, I was through, I held him close and danced with him, and was enjoying it SO much. He eventually went to dance with his friend, which was the last I saw of him...you know, so be it, I wasn't too attached. Well, until the end of the night, I was pretty much dancing alone. Well, earlier in the night, I accidentally broke Aimen's cell phone clip, and I felt really bad about it, and I was telling him I would go about buying him a new one. Well, HE SAYS, &quot;Oh, you can just make it up to me by letting me take you out to dinner...&quot; and I nearly flipped out.</p>
<p>I have been on and off interested in Aimen since last fall. He's so cute and really active and smart, and I would LOVE to date him. Well, it turned out what I thought was innocent &quot;bad&quot; dancing turned out to be Aimen coming onto me. I just walked away from him feeling absolutely livid. I can't believe how this night turned out. I called Gen shortly after to see how her and Missy's apartment party went. We decided to discuss it over an early breakfast at Waffle House, and on our way to Waffle House, we bump into Missy driving by, and we all end up talking about it. Tonight was fate. It was God telling me I was on the right path. God was telling me that I need to continue to do what I am doing and fight back against the old guard...you probably won't understand that, but I don't care.</p>
<p>Well, the only sad thing was this guy was interested in me and asked me out, but he really wasn't my type, so I turned him down. I felt kinda bad, cause it ruined his night I'm sure. Whatever, you know, I was sweet and hugged him, but he's not my type, I don't want to lead him on toward disappointment.</p>
<p>I just don't know what to say people, it's amazing that I'm finishing my super journal this way, but what can I say, this is like a short story, this week. It's like I was dealing with issues...issues dealt with...results occur. I'm so excited about the next week and the weeks to come. My focus now changes to...ok...how do I make me into a dating type person? I don't want to go out and him just be completely uninterested, so I'm going to have to ponder what to say and do. Come on people, let's give me a hand, I really did something tonight, I'm amazed. God bless all of you, I will be alright, I am sure of this...good morning.
