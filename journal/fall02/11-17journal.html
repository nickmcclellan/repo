<div class="post">
<p>Today was an exhausting day.  Fallout from last week has left two very distint changes...for one, I no longer have FrontPage.  This means I'm either going to have to buy it or I'm just going to have to learn html.  I am leaning toward html...it's the way most people do it, and from what I've done so far with my site, I think I can at least keep it updated...it's just going to be different.  The other change is just this overwhelming...creepiness...it's just really shitty...</p>
<p>Intention just freaks me out...and it's just overwhelming lately.  I know the real reason I feel what I feel, but it's intention that freaks me out.  I just can't stand intention...I try to avoid it.  I don't have any intention with anyone...just hope...foolish wishes.  I want things to happen...but I despise fucking around with people and their lives...  I don't know how to explain it...it's not like I am trying to hide anything from anyone, it's just what's under my skin right now...and it's hard to deal with.
<p>Well, last week was nice...up until Friday.  Missy and Sonya took me out on Wednesday to Applebee's and made this really sweet collage for me.  Sonya is certainly becoming a very trusted and loved friend of mine.  On my birthday, I spent the day with my mom.  It was the closest we have been in the last couple of years, I really enjoyed that time with her, and I know she did as well.  As far as breaking up with Aiman, I know it was the right thing to do.  On Saturday, he took me to Kronos Quartet...but I didn't really feel that welcomed at all, I felt that he's either having issues speaking to me or he just doesn't like me that much anymore.  It made me feel like I really shouldn't have come, and I thought that it would have been a step in the right direction going to the concert with him.  I guess not...afterward, I spent some time with Gen, which has been really cool lately.  I love just going over to her apartment and just sitting around with her.  We played Uno and watched Pulp Fiction.  She made me waffle icecream sandwiches...and I was really hungry from my "adventures" from Friday, so I really appreciated all she did for me</p>
<p>Regarding Friday night, I did alot I regret.  Sure, I was having fun at the time...but the way I feel afterward is just unbearable.  Why do I have to be so obnoxious when I'm drunk?  Why did I get drunk with all those people...I really am only "understood" by my close friends, and we always have such fun.  It's like, when I got drunk on Friday, I was doing it to "impress" those people...for some reason.  I wanted them to see me completly relaxed and at ease and having fun, but I need to do that the right way instead of the cheap way.  I just remember things that I was saying that were completly ridiculous.  Why the hell did I call Missy and flaunt that I loved her more then everyone else...that's so tacky!  They don't give a shit, and I shouldn't give a shit either, she's my friend and that should be enough.  Why the fuck did I have another drink?  I was FINE!!!  Why did I feel that another drink was a good thing?  Why was I mean to John...I know why, but I really should have been more mature about it.  Sigh...things just didn't happen like I wanted them to happen...and they won't...they just won't...</p>
<p>Well, regarding this weekend, it seemed I spent alot of time with Evan of all people.  He's a really nice guy, I really appreciated seeing him at Kronos.  I didn't feel very welcome, but talking to him made me feel alot better...like I had someone there I could talk to.  I hope he doesn't think I hate him or anything, I so don't...I just tease him alot...make fun that he's a freshman...but that's just fun.  I kinda wish I was still a freshman...but on second thought, I like the idea of moving on.  Well, I saw him at dinner, Laramie, the drunkeness...Kronos...and then again on Sunday.  Maybe it's because John is taking a real interest in him lately, and since I do hang around John, Evan has seemed to follow lately.  It's no secret that John likes Evan...but that just kinda freaks me out alittle...for one, I am pretty sure Evan is in a comfortable relationship with Walter...and that's so amazing!  God, it's great when anyone ends up just feeling so complete with someone.  Blah blah blah...words might have gone here, but they aren't here anymore :-X</p>
<p>Whatever it is that's bothering me, it's become a part of me.  I can't get rid of it...and I've been dying to.  I've been dying to just leave those emotions behind.  I can't...no one that I talk to seems to understand me...except Rachel.  She's going to call me tonight, I think, so that will make me feel better.  No one knows...and if they do, they really have no idea.  Now that I am without Aiman, maybe that will help me some.  I feel like going out and just having fun...I'm going to go to no cover night with Ilya Wednesday...and I want to just have fun...get away from things.  I will see how that changes things...</p>
<p>Well, because of me losing FrontPage, I'm going to be uploading my journal daily or whenever I do it so that I know the html I'm using is functioning.  I'll title this entry whenever I finish it...for now it's "Week of November 17th."  Oh well, time for the Lambda meeting...cya around...
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, November 19th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>The most amazing thing happened last night.  I was laying in bed, trying to sleep...just couldn't sleep, I had too much on my mind.  I have felt that way, especially the last couple of days.  I'm being swamped with thoughts...thoughts I wish I wasn't having.  I can't stand being exhausted, wanting to sleep, but unable to think of anything else.  I finally decided to get up and bore myself to sleep somehow, then Missy IMs me.  She tells me that she's felt that I've been down lately, and she just wanted to tell me that she loved me and she wanted to give me a hug and tell me that I'm so cute...I was like, ok...but it made me feel so much better.  She came down sometime around 1, and I swear she stayed until 3 in the morning.  We looked at random sorority pictures on the Internet, and let me tell you, that sure as hell put me to sleep.  She told me all about her adventures in New Orleans, and I told her about my disappointing weekend.  It was nice, she said that I act really mature with my relationships...which puzzled me.  I guess that's true, I do a good job with handling the people in my life.  I guess it's just strange to be told nice things...I guess after tearing yourself down, it's kinda strange to feel good about yourself for a change.</p>
<p>Rachel didn't call me last night, but that's ok.  She said she'd call tonight if she couldn't last night.</p>
<p>Today, I have to cover Lindsay's shift in the Lambda office.  She's going to be out this week, I hope she's doing alright.  After that, maybe I'll read something...preferably the last thing I'm going to have to read in English this semester, but I'm tempted to read one of the two books I have lined up to read.  Tonight, it's Buffy night.  I'm looking forward to seeing Thom and talking to him about all that has happened.  He's one of my close friends that helped me realize that if I wasn't happy with what was going on in my relationship with Aiman, then I had an obligation to myself and him to do something about it.  I did just that, and I really want to share with Thom what that was like.  Plus, Buffy fun!</p>
<p>The semester seems to be winding down, all I really have left are finals.  Only a handful of weekends left until Winter Break...then I'm just going to be bored at home...working...Missy just got back from her advising appointment...turns out she didn't take the Regent's Test and has to take remedial classes.  Sucks for her, we'll figure something out...well, I have to go to the office now...tootles.

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, November 20th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Grrr...my computer crashed while I was making this stupid journal, so now I'm all bored of doing this a second time...so I'll be brief.  I'm going to Shawn Pirkle's party tonight with John, which should be fun, I hadn't heard about it until this afternoon, and I hope it will be a good time.  I'm really looking forward to doing Boneshakers tonight too, I've been dying to do something different and fun, and I don't remember the last time I went out on a Wednesday night.  I want to see people and I want to see life!</p>
<p>I really would like to see a movie this weekend.  I want to see North by Northwest tomorrow, but I'm not sure who will be available.  Oh well, I suppose I could rent it if I really want to see it, but I'm wanting to see Frida on Friday...I think it sounds like a unique movie that I may find enjoyable.  I loved Amelie, and I saw Amelie on a friend's suggestion...I thought I would HATE it, but it's one of my most favorite movies.  Maybe I'll enjoy Frida?  We'll see.</p>
<p>Not much else for me to say...it seems that this week is getting better.  I want something interesting to happen, and I suppose doing some different things might facilitate that.  Falling into the same patterns really only yields the same results.  So let's give them up for a change...
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, November 21st...2:30AM</h2>
<div class="post"
<p>Oh, wow, all I can say is wow...I feel so good right now, it's like, things just clicked...or did they?  I don't know, I'm a bit apathetic that tomorrow I'm just going to feel bad again, but fuck, I don't care.  That's the point of how I'm feeling now.  I could give a shit anymore.  I don't care!  I'm giving it all up because not caring feels so much better then wearing your heart on your sleeve.  It's like, well, let me share my nice night...</p>
<p>Well, it all started when I got back from dinner with Ilya and followed some advice about file sharing software.  It turns out SoulSeek works so well in the dorms!  I sat in my room for two hours downloading every garbage album track to my computer...oh, it makes me feel so happy!  Now, I can listen to any garbage song anytime again!  I was able to get a few b-sides too, but I realize those may take awhile to get.  Well, Ilya also sent me some cool songs, and I appreciate exposure.  It's like, God, lately, I think I've been talking so much about that movie <I>Donnie Darko</i>...and it's a good movie, yes, but COME ON!!!  There are better movies, and better movies will come along...and it's not my favorite, but I always seem to be talking about it, and I'm dying to get my hands on something different.  Well, Ilya helped me do that at least with the music.</p>
<p>After downloading all my music, I headed out to Shawn Pirkle's party which turned out to be a big breath of fresh air.  I don't hang out much with the older Lambda crowd, and I would really like to have a place in it...I mean, yah, the freshman are nice, and maybe we represent a new Lambda generation...but I feel somewhat tied to the old guard.  Rachel was there!  Wow, when I saw her, I was so happy!  She got really drunk and I had two Vodka jello shots...but that wasn't enough to get me going, so I was cool to drive.  We sat around and lamented about the drunkeness with John...apparently I said more tacky things that I originally thought.  Oh well, what can you do?  So, I had to leave and get Ilya, so John joined me (and he beat me to Reed...it pissed me off that he won, but I got to drive really fast listening to "I Think I'm Paranoid" on River Rd., so I was kinda peaved about that).  We got Ilya and headed for Bones...</p>
<p>We got to Boneshakers, and not much went on initially.  I saw CHARLIE, who I'm always SO VERY HAPPY TO SEE...AT SOMETIMES MORE SO THEN <B>PADMINI</b>!!!  Well, after a while, some people from Pirkle's party showed up...INCLUDING Rachel.  We talked a bit, and then Nice Matt came and I kinda hung out the rest of the time with him, John, and Ilya.  Just want to say...Ilya is such a good friend, it's like...he's a brother to me.  I feel close to him in a different way.  Well, Nice Matt is fun to talk to...we sat and talked with Ilya for awhile...and we all danced for a while...it was fun!  I just felt so empowered and loved...it was great...I don't want to feel any other way then I feel right now.</p>
<p>Basically, I feel the best when I focus on what it is that I have instead of what it is that I don't have.  I have so much!  I'm so amazingly fortunate!  I have the best friends anyone could ask for.  Missy and Gen, wow, I feel like the relationships I have with them are incredibly mutual, and we help eachother out, and lift eachother when we're down.  And my family, they are supportive of me...despite being very fucked up themselves...but there are other things!  Now I have a whole lot of garbage songs to play when I wake up or when I'm just in a bad mood and want to feel better.  If there was a song to describe my sense of euphoric empowerment, it would either be "Breaking Up The Girl" or "Can't Cry These Tears."  Because, I really don't care...I really don't care anymore, no, seriously!  Do what you want to do, I'm going to be perfectly happy in my little world and do what it was I've always done...with our without you.  And "Breaking Up The Girl"...well, "One mistake's / All it takes / And your life has come undone / Walk away 'cause you're breaking up the girl / It's a drag, I know it's hard / But you're tearing her apart..."  I just feel like walking away from it all and just exploring this energy that I have in me now.  There is so much to live for and there is no reason in this world to be bogged down with the things you can't control.  God, I just turned 20 years old, and I have so much ahead of me, so much to live for.  Why am I doom and gloom about the things I don't have?  I have had some amazing experiences and opportunities, and there are going to be more, so many more!  It's coming, I know...I don't know what or when, but I do know something's coming.  And I'm waiting.</p>
<p>...well, this day has been alright.  I went over to Gen's and watched ER.  It was successful, she felt better...but I feel like shit...and I'm really tired...need sleep...goodnight.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, November 23rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I just got back from my night last night, which was, thankfully, a welcomed distraction.  I went to Ilya's fashion show, and it was a really interesting experience.  Matt went with me, which was really cool cause Missy cancelled at the last minute.  Well, so many cute guys at the show...wow, this one guy in grey and black...I couldn't stand but look at him, he was so hot!  Ilya said he was really full of himself, so that's kinda a turn off for me.  We had fun though.  I am falling in love with this girl I talked to there!  I sat next to her at Laramie and she was mentioning Donnie Darko or something, and last night, it turns out she's a big film major...and she's so incredibly smart and knows all these cool movies.  She was so adorable, but I felt so inferior to her that when she asked if I'd see her again...I told her that we'll have to see what fate decides for us...I felt two inches compared to her...I didn't want to disappoint her.  I'm going to watch <I>The Big Sleep</i> cause she told me I should.  Maybe after some adventures in film, I'll feel more to her level :-)</p>
<p>After the show, we all had the funnest time in the Rivermill area of Athens trying to find this apartment party...it was so odd...I stopped by Rachel's place, but she wasn't there.  She called me though...hehe.  Well, we finally gave up on finding the party and went to Gen's apartment for a brief visit.  She made me two Eggos, and we were off on a renewed venture for the party...and we found it this time.  All the show people were there, but I just didn't fit in...Matt and I sat on a couch and played a game on Ilya's cell phone.  This bored the hell out of me...draining any Boneshakers energy...so sadly, I took the guys back to my dorm to watch a movie.  We WERE going to watch <I>Y Tu Mama Tambien</i>, but Ilya's roommate was too busy FUCKING his girlfriend, so we couldn't get to the DVD.  We opted for <I>Donnie Darko</i>...but then switched to <I>Amelie</i> because both Matt and Ilya hadn't seen it.</p>
<p>Happily, Ilya didn't agree with my observation that <I>Amelie</i> was a rip off of <I>Red</i>.  I love <I>Amelie</i>, so I'm glad that I could possibly be wrong.  While watching it, I realized I can totally relate to her...how she goes about things.  She's too afraid to take chances for herself, but she goes to the ends of the Earth to please others...to make their lives better.  She is also a dreamer...she believes things are going to happen to her in a fantastic, mind-blowing way...and she finds her dreamer in Nino.  They end up together...and that kinda made me think...maybe I'll end up with my dreamer?  I'm not in a rush, neither was she...so I'm just going to play it cool...like Amelie :-)</p>
<p>After I dropped off the guys, I called Sonya and Missy to figure out what the hell they did tonight.  I was about to go to my nice, comfy bed and sleep...but walking down out of the parking deck, Sonya calls me back and invites me to her place to hang out.  It turns out Missy and Sonya got drunk at Gen's and were watching movie's at Sonya's, so I opted for Sonya's too.  I ended up staying the night.  I was so exhausted, I slept in Sonya's bed with Missy...I didn't even pay much attention to the fact that Missy and I have never slept in the same bed together...like that means ANYTHING...but I just slept, woke up...and was refreshed again!  Yey!  Sonya made us pancakes...they were delicious...and then I watched some crap MTV shows with them, and went back here.  Now, I think I'll take a nap or whatever...feeling very fatigued.  Hope you all like the title for this week's journal...if you're smart, you can tell me from what I fetched it from.  I bet you're not that smart though...
