<div class="post">
<p>Oh, I had a very restful weekend. I got home on Sunday morning and dished with the family some more (told them I had caught my roommate &quot;playing&quot; with his vibrator again, actually, I caught him again today after I got back from the gym!). After my dad made me a tasty omelet, I took a very nice nap. In the nap, it was very strange, I dreamt I had a b/f and I was so into doing the cool intimate stuff, you know, like holding hands and crap. It was a great little sleep.</p>
<p>Well, fast forward to today, I did my Ramsey, and it was worth it, yes. Earlier this week, since I had skipped running on Sunday because I went home, I had a mini crisis with my pace. Because I was doing 3.5 miles last week, I bumped myself up to 4 on Tuesday. Up until the last mile, I could have sworn my legs were dying on me. I was very fearful that I would have to start walking because I just couldn't keep up. It turned out it was just my body being alittle bitch, and I finished my 4 miles with no problem, and felt great following</p>
<p>This Friday, I'm going on another date with Aiman. I like how whatever this is is starting. I feel very comfortable with the pace. I don't feel like I have to have a commitment, but I also feel like I'm making appropriate headway toward a committed relationship, which is what I've always wanted. I feel like at any point, I can just stop it and chock it up to, &quot;You know Aiman, you're not the one.&quot; Well, that's not really the truth, I'm into Aiman, and I'm developing more intense feelings for him. NOT TO SAY THE FEELINGS ARE INTENSE, but I feel like I could fall for him...I guess.</p>
<p>I wanted to go out tonight to the no cover night, but I feel that working on my English paper a night early is a better use of my time. Because I'm finally putting some much needed attention toward my social and physical life, my academics are taking a small hit. I mean, come on! Years of getting good grades, can't Karma cut me a break? I'm so sick of being unhappy and smart, now that I'm developing some happiness, I have to struggle with a challenging academic schedule. Oh well, bring it on. I can take it...or I can try.</p>
<p>Not much else to say. I had a good time in the Lambda office this afternoon. Come and see me during the week! Monday and Wednesday from 4 until 5pm. You can see my laptop and maybe even listen to some obscure garbage mp3's. Rachel needs to come at least, or else I'm going to BEAT HER! HAHAHA...goodbye losers.

<p>Yes...today...it was productive, I like to think. I did 4 miles today, and this was very difficult at the time. I had pains similar to the ones I experienced on Tuesday, and I was very fearful that I was getting shin splints again. I decided to run through it, which was an excellent choice, because I got over the pain. I finished my 4 miles and felt wonderful afterwards. It's so hard to get up at 9, go to Ramsey at 9:30 and exert yourself so much, all at the beginning of the day...I am surprised I continue to commit to it. What can I say, I have to keep a good figure if I expect to keep a b/f :-D</p>
<p>I think I wrote a good English paper for tomorrow. I walked myself up the the library this afternoon, sat down and just focused completely on it, and I think the by-product will prove to be very good. Confidence is an excellent treatment for mild depression. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed this afternoon, and it is calming to know that I am free from obligations, at least for the weekend.</p>
<p>I'm going on a second date with Aiman tomorrow. Hopefully I will feel more at ease with him and I can establish a closer relationship with him. I'm taking him to dinner and to a Tate movie...<i>Kissing Jessica Stein</i>. I hope that that will be interesting. I was considering seeing if he'd like to watch <i>Amelie</i> at his place...but I think that would be...too quick...I dig going slow, feels more comfortable. Maybe next week. I'll have to let you all know how it goes...until then!

<p>I had a very nice time with Aiman last night. He was an excellent date, and I felt so much more at ease with him. The only thing that I wish I would have done would be to kiss him. I don't know why I'm such a chicken shit when it comes to just holding his hand...but I just have this voice (not like psycho voice, mind you) in my head that make me think that I shouldn't do it...when I have this inkling that he would love me to do it. I just don't know what my problem is...he asked me today if I'd like to go to Waffle House with him and his friend Alexis...but I really didn't feel like going...I hope he didn't think I didn't want to go with him, it's just I wanted to relax some more. I kinda want to debrief with John, but he wasn't in his room...I may just end up eating here until Missy gets back here.</p>
<p>Tonight...I think I might drink with Missy tonight. I want to see if she'd like to come to Aiman's to meet him, maybe she will. If I'm drinking though, I dunno...if I'm drinking, not sure how I'm going to get to his apartment, but I want to spend some more time with him. I want him to know I want to spend more time with him. I just, you know, I spent almost 10 hours with him last night, not that I'm sick of him or anything, but I enjoy just laying down and watching TV in my room and just not being social. I'm an introvert, what can I say. I need to hide for a while and then crawl back out of my whole and see him again. Kinda like Groundhog Day, but I definitely want to see him more then one day a year. Tomorrow, I would like to see if he wants to watch <i>Amelie</i> with me, tomorrow night. Maybe not too late, just a nice night movie, him and me. I'll call him tomorrow and ask him about it. Yeah, I really like him, and I still think he really likes me...so this is very cool. I'm really going to enjoy going out with Aiman</p>
<p>Well, I'm off now...hunger beckons. Have a good time tonight my friends!
