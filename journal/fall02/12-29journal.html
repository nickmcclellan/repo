<div class="post">
<p>Well, I'm actually writing this entry from my Dad's computer, it's very strange...  I'm pretty sure it will work, actually, it's pretty easy.  Turns out Microsoft Word is a pretty easy-to-use program for updating my journal entries...I may switch to using that.  Journal entries really aren't that complex of HTML.</p>
<p>I titled this week's journal as such because it's from The Flaming Lips song "Fight Test", a beautiful song, and it sorta goes off on how I've been feeling this Christmas break.  I really don't know...things have been so blurry and mysterious lately.  I'm so far away from the people I care about, it's hard to have any sort of relationship here.  Also, I've been working overnights, so you think I would know where the sunbeams and the starlight begins, but you'd be surprised.  The last time I saw the sun was on Sunday, and before that it was the day after Christmas...my times with the sun this break have been few and far between.  I really am a bloodsucking fiend of the night, minus the bloodsucking of course.  It will all be over soon...actually, not as soon as I had hoped.  Turns out I will be working an extra day this Friday night into Saturday morning.  I agreed to it because I do need to money, and I need to take every opportunity I can to get as much time on the clock as possible.</p>
<p>Today is New Year's Eve, and while I will be spending most of the day sleeping, I was planning on going out tonight and having a great time with the people I've missed so much...that seems to have changed, and it makes me just a little bit upset...I won't get into details, but let's just say if I end up at my house tonight for New Year's, I will not be happy.</p>
<p>I want to go home so bad...things here are getting so much worse every day.  It seems like being at home just makes me so miserable.  My computer is acting up, I'm pretty sure it's the battery, but I can't even boot it up now.  Replacing the battery should help, I hope.  The situation with my Mom and my Dad is about to get really out of control...God help me if that gets too hard to handle.  Depending on what happens, I may head back to Athens early to stay with one of my apartment friends.  Hopefully they will have me.  I don't think it will come to that...since I have to stay until Saturday morning anyways, I'll probably stay until Sunday.</p>
<p>I'm beginning to wonder...what am I going to do when I get back to Athens?  What is there to do that is different from here?  I'm sure school will be a bitch this semester.  I would like to make a 4.0 once...John showed me his President's list certificates when I stayed over his house...that bastard, thinks he's smarter then me!  Well, I'll show him...</p>
<p>Well, I guess I can write about my time at John's.  It was excellent, and his parents were excellent hosts.  His dad was very charming, and he liked watching Buffy, and we watched some of that, and he really enjoyed it.  His mother was eager to watch it as well, and she got scared at very interesting portions.  John's house is very interesting and very big!  John had a very nice room too, much more decorative then mine at home (of course my Athens room is better, I mean, he didn't have one picture of Shirley Manson...he had one of Bill Clinton though...wtf, right?).  It was also fun to keep John awake until the wee hours of the morning....HAHAHA!  Well, on Sunday morning, he took me to the Buckhead Target.  That place was just too elaborate for a Target...and they DIDN'T have my Buffy Season 2 DVD, so that pissed me off (though being pissed off at Target is not a new feeling).  We got it at Borders though (and noticed many gay guys...very cool to be in a place FINALLY that had some more homosexuals...Target is just agony with all those breeders walking around...).  The whole sleepover was a great opportunity to get to know more intimate details about John, and I must admit I was surprised to see what I saw.  It's always very interesting to see where people come from.  Anyways, John invites a lot of people over to his house, so you all should go too.  John was an excellent host :-)</p>
<p>Well, now it's time to see if this uploads correctly onto my website...let's hope it does.  Now, I'm off to bed.  Please stay safe tonight, and have a HAPPY NEW YEAR!

<p>I was working at Target this morning...I realized just how miserable I am.  Things are so gross here.  I want to go back to UGA, but it's not that simple.  I feel like this is going to linger for a while.  I think I've been in a weird funk lately.  I'm not sure what's going to pull me out of it, but I hope I find it in Athens.  I sure hope it's there.  I'm tired of feeling this way.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone.  Like I figured, I spent my New Year's Eve alone at home.  On the surface, it sounds really bad, but I promise you it wasn't.  It's what I had to do, and I'm glad I did it.  I'm not angry about anything either...but I promise you this.  I won't forget.  That's worse then being angry, unfortunately...but I'm not mad.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have now two more overnights left at Target.  I'm supposed to just have one, but I agreed to work an extra night.  That will be good in the long-run.  I am hoping to spend Saturday night with Quiana or some high school people...not sure it will happen or not, but I will try.  Two more nights.  It seems like so much.  That's why I felt so miserable...thinking that I have to live through that.  You would think that after 3 weeks of overnights, two days would be nothing.  I guess not.  The last night I'm doing planograms.  I don't like that I'll be doing one night of planograms after 4 months of not doing planograms.  It seems so worthless.  Whatever, Target beckons, I yield.</p>
<p>I wish I had more to say, but I don't.  Maybe when I get back to Athens I will.  I swear, it seems like next semester is going to be Heaven...but we'll see.  Trying not to get my hopes up, trying to just stay grounded.  I just wish I had my friends.  I just want to go home...

<p>Yes!  My nights of Price Change are over.  This is wonderful, because last night was hard to live through.  I was told that I have a lot of patience.  I was mulling that over tonight.  I didn't want to say anything about this...because I figured since I wouldn't write anything mean about one my UGA people, then I shouldn't write anything about mean about any of my Target people...but I'm sorry, Aundrea is a bitch.  I don't know what her deal is, but she has some sort of qualm against me, and I'm tired of just smiling and taking it.  You know, I do have a lot of patience.  Inside, I think, "Man, I wish I could just yell at that bitch and tell her to stop breathing down my neck."  She seems to think I'm incompetent.  She must think I'm some kiss-butt or something, which is so not the case.  I don't know what her deal is, but there have been times during this overnight when I know she was talking about me.  She would sit on her ass activating labels...just glaring at me.  I didn't let it effect me, I just patiently did my work and took it, I don't care.  She has no power over me, I don't care if she hates me.  She is NOTHING to me.  I just wanted to write here that I think she's a major bitch.</p>
<p>I found out that I will be working overnight tonight with Lily on shoe planograms.  This is good news.  I've did that this summer, and Lily is awesome, I like working with her.  After that...it's over.  It's all over!  I can't wait, I think I'll stay awake all day Saturday and walk around outside, in the sun, just to see if I'll burst into flames.  I don't think I will...well, obviously.  Maybe I've just been watching too much Buffy.  That's for sure, I've got Seasons One and Two on DVD and Season Three on its way...I am going to have to find my WinDVD decoder for my computer...that will make my office hours next semester so cool!  I could watch Buffy every day...HAHAHA.  John is such and awesome friend...he got me Season One and he let me bitch about stuff too...and I heard about his evening out on New Years.  John is a keeper.

<div class="post">
<p>I'm free...and I'm exhausted.  I'm trying to last the day, but it's 2:26PM now and I feel like keeling over and dying.  I know if I fall asleep it's not going to help at all, I need to get back on days.  This time tomorrow, I could be home.  It will all start over again.  I feel this dark sense of familiarity.  I walked into Spring Semester last year thinking things would just fold out for me.  They didn't.  In fact, Spring Semester sucked last year.  Yah, there were some times...times that I look back on and I remember fondly, but all in all, it was familiar and boring.  I feel that, now.  I feel like things are going to be so nice, but then I have this dark resonance inside.  It's telling me things are not going to happen like I think they will.  I don't know what's real and what's fake.  I only have this desire for things to work out.  I guess it's like skee-ball...maybe I'll sink some, maybe I won't.  I'll avoid the pointless nights with Missy and I'll continue trying to branch out.  I'll help with Lambda.  I'll grow closer to other people.  That's what I want to do.  And other things...</p>
<p>I talked to Missy today.  It was a very brief exchange, but I felt so wonderful afterward.  She said, and I quote, "sooo much drama, more than daniel tyndall could ever amass."  That's so funny that she mentioned Daniel Tindol...she's so crazy, she remembers a lot.  Apparently, her Christmas was as miserable as mine was, just in different ways.  I can't wait to hear about it.</p>
<p>My last overnight was not what I thought it would be.  Lily didn't show up, so we did Revisions all night.  I have never done Revisions, so opening that can of worms was just pointless.  Well, I ended my stint at Target the only way I know how...being stuck doing something that will never be done.  Well, not exactly.  I started a Revision in the soap aisle that would have to have more time that I had to give.  I was NOT going to stick around Target until 8:30 in the morning...Luckily Cat and I decided to pull the plug on the project half way.  Ed and Company will be pissed...but by the time I get back in May, they won't even remember.  Lisa Smith gave me a big hug when I left and told me she hopes I get on the President's List.  People are nice to me...it's too bad it was such a miserable experience, those people were pretty cool.  I just need out.</p>
<p>Is my laundry done yet?!  I think I might take a nap...I need one.  This is my last journal before the update.  I'm sorry I was such an ass this time around.  I am learning from my mistakes.  I'll behave myself this semester.  I promise.  Please comment on the update!  I think it looks really nice :-)
