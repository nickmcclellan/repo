<div class="post">
<p>Tonight, I start my first full-time week at Target since this summer. I am working 39 hours (thought I'm sure I will stick around for about an hour or more at some point...). I am working overnight.</p>
<p>I go there in about 4 hours. I tried to sleep today, but it was difficult to do. I'm used to sleeping at night, so I'm going to have to adjust tonight. I'm going to be dead on my ass in the morning, and I will sleep like a baby, but I will get my work done. Once this is all over, I will be very happy with myself. My financial situation will improve significantly, though I will still have to be frugal next semester. At least I will have my credit card debt under control. It's not like I am a bad example for college students with credit cards, I've done a very good job involving my credit. I have only charged what was absolutley necessary. My financial &quot;crisis&quot; is that I don't have enough savings to back up my balance, so I need to work over the break to replenish my savings. I think I can do that.</p>
<p>Today has just been really blah. I don't want to go to work. I don't want to do any of this. I'm in this vicious cycle of &quot;home&quot; things, and I don't like it. The more I get into that, the farther I get from everything that has made me feel so good. I miss Athens...and I miss Bryant :-(

<div class="post">
<p>7:56AM may not seem that LATE to you, but it's extremely late for me...especially after my first night overnight since this summer. Tonight was an adjustment. Sure, I was afraid I wasn't well versed enough in Price Change to do the job well, but I was actually a hell of alot faster then most of the other people...just goes to show you how mindless this job really is.</p>
<p>Up until my first break, I was feeling pretty miserable and tired. I called Bryant on my break, and though we only talked briefly, just a short conversation was enough to pep me up. I mean, I'm feeling pretty head over heals about him lately, trying to keep myself on the floor...I've been pretty good about that. I just feel like connecting with him, even though being so far away prevents that. He's really incredible, I messaged him that, so he should already know...but just so everyone else knows...Bryant is pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Now that that's been said, I digress. I probably should sleep now, but I decided to share something here because it gives me something to look forward to. Maybe he'll read it and he'll feel special...and even though I'm sleeping, he'll feel special, and I'll sleep soundly. Ok, ok, I should probably stop...yeah, sleep...so DON'T call me, cause death will be a consequence...unless you're special, then you can call me, I won't mind (btw, Missy is special too, she can call, but I might bitch at her. Vicki is not special...HAHAHAHA).</p>>...Writing journals while I'm doing overnight shifts is odd. I mean, it's not like when I go to sleep I can start on the next day. That's one of the oddest things about overnights. Melissa (this CHARMING woman at Target who remembered me and was sweet to me last night) asked me if i got much sleep YESTERDAY. To me, the days had not changed yet. It would have been more appropriate to ask, &quot;Did you get much sleep today?&quot; That's the most interesting thing about working nights. Realizing just how short days are. For everyone else, it's like, you go to sleep, and then you wake up, and it's tomorrow. For me, it seems, the days never end. I go to sleep in the morning and wake up in the afternoon, the day doesn't change. Then when I work overnight, the day doesn't change, because how can it change if I'm awake? Tomorrow comes in your sleep. When I'm at home, now, it seems, tomorrow never comes.

<p>Well, the second overnight is over. This was especially boring and has led me to believe that all these overnights are going to be rip-my-arm-off-and-beat-myself-with-it boring...OMG...you have no idea. I can't STAND stocking Trim. It's so pointless! Who the hell is going to buy all this damn tissue paper? I don't know, and I could give a fuck...thank GOD this girl Elizibeth was there to talk to. She was an avid Buffy fan like me, and we talked about that and Twin Peaks, which I wish I could see. Sounds very interesting... Well, I knew I was getting delirious because I laughed hysterically at the thought of a demon Giles chasing a terrified Maggie Walsh around the UC Sunnydale campus...I'm losing it! Apathy seems to be the big effect from these overnights. I don't care about anything Target related...all I keep looking at is the time...when is it going to be January 5th? How long do I have to wait now?</p>
<p>I hope I'm not freaking anyone out...I'm just very unstable when I'm doing overnights. I'm not normal. I don't fit in well with others. I just want to have something to do...</p>
<p>Well, I look forward to seeing my Buffy tonight...that will be a nice nugget to chew on while working into the endless night.</p>
<p>I talked to Missy, Sonya, Vicki (who I LOVE!!!), and Ilya briefly online last night before work. That was pretty cool, it was a surprising spirit lifter. It was a good reminder of what I truly have to treasure...but you know that, so I'll stop ranting about that whole &quot;all I have&quot; crap. I know it, you read about it. End of story. Well, that just gave me a momentary boost.</p>
<p>I'm bored, so I'm going to be corny and give some sort of blurp about Bryant. I DID write this little thing about him after the first time I met him. The night before my birthday, Missy, Aiman, and I all went to Boneshakers, and it was alot of fun...I know I mentioned it. That was the week my computer crashed, so whatever I did write was lost, but I did mention Bryant. I met him while we were leaving the club, and he was palling around with Whit. I thought he was straight, he seemed so &quot;frat boyish&quot;, as Missy would say. He was drunk, like I was, and we were both romping around in our drunken states...I always seem to be more social, so I was really into talking to him. We got to the Grill, and Aiman sorta sat on one side talking to people which left me in a corner with Missy and Bryant. He had half of my milkshake, but I was cool with it. I definitely thought he was adorable, and I was excited about the idea that maybe he was straight and interested in Missy. I was still with Aiman at the time, so I wasn't going to pursue anything with him, so I just sorta let it be, and gave him my Instant Messeger. That's basically how it happened, nothing too exciting...THOUGH, there is ONE THING I have to ask him about the night which I keep forgetting to do. I'll ask him the next time I talk to him. Maybe after that, I'll mention something about it here.</p>
<p>Ok, I'm spent...bedtime for me! It's only 7:24AM...isn't that wild? My world is so screwed up right now...

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, December 21st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>This week has been very interesting. I've been kinda busy, with work and all, and I haven't really felt a need to update my journal. I remember driving back from working thinking of something interesting I could write, but I'd always ended up in bed first...it's hard to get up and write a journal after that...</p>
<p>This thing with Bryant is really nice. He came and saw me on Friday, and he just left today. Bringing that situation back home was VERY interesting...I still can't believe he was here. He's so amazing. It's so wonderful to have something I really don't care to share with anyone...it's just for us. I wish Missy was around, but she's in Aspen with the 'rents...I'd love to tell her everything. All I want to say is that I miss him, and I look forward to that day we're both back in Athens and can really explore just what this whole thing can become.</p>
<p>My prayers are with Missy in these hard times...she's going through alot, and I hope she makes it through. I miss all my friends...not seeing her every day is just alittle odd. I miss her...I miss them all. Ok, I'm tired...Hopefully I'll write soon.
