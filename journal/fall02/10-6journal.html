<p>Ok, today was my &quot;Grrr Day.&quot; I don't want to go into what it was a bad day, more like why it was a good day. I went to Ramsey and did a fairly productive work out. I shared my coming out story. I got to know much better one of Aiman's friends (I don't want to butcher her name just yet) and we talked about Buffy. I got to introduce a good friend who's dealing with issues involving his sexuality to a bunch of cool people. WinMX started to work again today, and I got to download some cool songs (including a mystery remix of &quot;Stupid Girl&quot;). I had a very social night out with the Lambda people and didn't have to spend lots of money. Got to see Aiman.</p>
<p>I got back just a while ago. I'm sitting here, convinced I'm going to work on Spanish, but I know I'm not. I will make an effort...maybe. I kinda feel like sitting here and writing for the hour I have before I shamefully watch my Dragonball Z. These are the nights I treasure the fact I no longer have a roommate. I feel like in these moments, I am the most anti-social. I feel like any social reaction, whether it be good or bad, is just awkward and unfamiliar. When I start to get confused with people, I feel like I need to lock myself in a room and just avoid all interaction. Actually, not all interaction. I am hoping Missy will stop by before the end of the night for a visit. I would love to see her face and hear about her day and just have her presence to make me so blessed to have a friend like her. Hopefully she will read this and realize just how important she is to me.</p>
<p>I hope I feel better this week. I need another good week. Something needs to change, I am not sure what. Maybe I need to be depressed about something so I will feel justified about feeling good about something because I would have balanced the scale. I don't know what I want or what will make me feel really happy. I think I am truly the happiest when things are just about to get &quot;better.&quot; It's that raw potential, that spontaneity, it just drives me to all these conclusions. Now, it just seems like I'm so stagnant. It feels like life is unfolding around me, but I am just standing still, and I just don't feel that progression. Maybe it's just tonight, and my &quot;Grrr Day,&quot; I just don't know. I feel alittle better that I was able to write something down. I maybe just lay around and write in my other journal for a while, that will be cool. Much love to all!

<p>Well, here I am. I tried to find some sort of writing encouragement, but I just don't know where to look. I don't think I have anything interesting to say. I have found other people's journals, and the neat thing about theirs is that every day it's updated. Would it be better if I uploaded my journals every day? I am wondering this...but I don't think that would be cool. I have envisioned my journals as a weekly thing. Not something you should get in little clumps. I was going through my old journals from last year, and it was really neat how some weeks were so different then others. It's kinda like a &quot;Nick update.&quot; If you really want to know how my day went, why don't you ask me? I am not going to upload a blurp about it because you're too scared to ask me.</p>
<p>I don't understand why people read it anyways. Honestly, I thought only a small handful of people read it in the first place. Missy and Vicki, and Gen occasionally...that was it! My journal from last week, so far, has 17 hits! I know one of those hits was from me to see if it was uploaded correctly, but that's 16 hits from tons of people I may or may not know. I know that Anthony said he caught up with my journal...but as far as that, there should only be 4 regular people reading it. I find that really interesting...a bunch of people are actually interested in what's happening to ME! That's very odd. No one every mentions it though...Daniel did :-D I really appreciated that. Actually, because I wrote about him a few weeks ago, he mentioned what I said, and that was weird. I had to think about what I wrote about him, thinking that it might not have been appropriate for him to read. It was, of course, everything I write about anyone is appropriate. Since then, I have read HIS livejournal, and it's very interesting. He had a spat with people from Dacula, and it's really big for him, and it was neat to be like a fly on the wall for something like that.</p>
<p>Well, I would stay here and continue, but it's Buffy night, and I am really looking forward to spending an hour with my friend Thom. Adios all!

<p>Late last night, I finally got what I wanted. I really can't impart what exactly that means, because I'm not quite sure myself. I just got my senses back, or just had an epiphany. I curled up and slept, nothing more. I just ended whatever crazy crusade I was thinking about. I feel better, I suppose.</p>
<p>It was a nice day out today. I like the cold days, days I can wrap myself in layers, walk around in the cold air feeling warm and loved. I like my leather jacket. It's like a security blanket, if I haven't already told you. I feel so safe inside, like no one can breach those impenetrable walls of intoxicating leather. I remember nights last year, it was so cold in Athens. Missy and I would walk down random streets, and she would be so cold, and I would let her wear my jacket. I felt like a good guy when I did that. I don't have any reason to do something like that. It's not like I'm going to walk her up to her room in Brumby hall and get what I've earned. It makes me feel good to share whatever I have with her and make her feel better. I can't describe the feeling I get when I know my friends are happy.</p>
<p>Gen told me yesterday that she was happy. She met this guy Zach at Uptown on Saturday. I remember chatting with her that night, while I was bored, trapped in my house, alone. She was drinking some beer...I went to bed while she was on number four. Turns out she went out that night and met Zach. She is sure he's going to call her and that makes me feel good. I know that I will feel good, but I'm uncertain that my friend will find their way. I wish I could take her with me wherever I go so I can show her who she needs to be with, but I can't. There is only so much I can do. I feel very pleased to know that Gen feels good.

<p>I had a very nice Friday night. Very interesting. It was the Coming Out Ball, and my boyfriend got homocoming queen! I felt like the star quarterback, in a very cool queer way.</p>
<p>I don't have much to say about the ball, in fact, I'm not sure I have much to say at all. Thinking...I could have sworn there was something interesting I could write down. Well, I got alittle drunk on Friday at Daniel's after party. That was cool, because I don't think alot of people see me drinking that often. It was fun. It was really funny to hear Jeremy talk about how Everclear causes spontaneous human combustion and other crazy shit. Also, Aiman and I had a &quot;conference&quot; in the guest room again, and me being drunk, I was less opposed to the idea. I actually stole someone's choker collar thing, which I will be sure the return once I find where I've stuck it. It was a very cool night. Also, something I feel alittle bad about, it turns out there is alot of DRAMA involving Daniel and Co., involving people possibly FUCKING in a room. I felt bad because I was joking about it earlier, and it turned out that a person involved in the nonexistent fucking took offence to people talking about it. I dunno, if I was involved, I would be confident in what I said is what happened, giving no notice to anyone's idiotic suggestions. I just want to say, for what it's worth, it should just be dropped because I think both persons involved were just talking. Hopefully people will forget about it, there were much more fun things happening besides some private conversation behind a closed door...</p>
<p>To develop this journal, I will share things that made me especially happy this week. Post-mysterious epiphany, that is. I really enjoyed seeing so many people at the Coming Out Ball, seeing Rachel was especially nice. I love when she spends time with me, though I am beginning to wish she would start calling on some of her good days. I enjoyed having dinner with a few close friends, it was very reminiscent of my prom night. I felt really good this week after deciding not to do my English paper on Thursday night. I just couldn't do it, and I know I wasn't just being lazy. I felt good about my Spanish composition too, I put alot of effort into that. I was very happy to see Missy tonight, after she got second at her regatta at Chattanooga. I enjoyed spending the night with Aiman on Friday, and was really happy he let me go back tonight without too much protest. I hope he understands that though staying over with him is such a wonderful thing, I really do want to sleep alone in my bed one night and get a good night's rest.</p>
<p>Ok, I could have sworn in some old journal from last year I wrote about <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, but if I didn't, I just want to put forth that I think it is an AWESOME movie! I don't know of any other movie that makes me feel disgusted with myself. I'm NOT saying that I feel like I am Tom Ripley in the movie at all (he is a very sick, twisted psycho) but I just understand where he's coming from. I can see the source of all those dark yearnings. It just shows how twisted people can really be.</p>
<p>Alright, that's all for me, goodnight all!
