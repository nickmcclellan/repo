	 Missing Footprints

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/buffybrokenicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I didn't have a good night last night. If this were the place for honesty, perhaps I'd say why. But this isn't the place for honesty. This is a place, like all the others, where I have to put my best face forward, and fake it. Don't ever forget that.<p>Anyways, I was thinking. Why is it that we have to be so strong when we're not? How is it that we even make it to the next day when we feel like the next moment is just going to tear us completely to pieces? It makes me think of that Footsteps in the Sand poem. Certainly you've heard it:</p><table class="emphasize" width="300" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"tr><td><em>Footprints in the Sand</em><br>by: Mary Stevenson<br><br>One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Lord.<br>Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky.<br>In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand.<br>Sometimes there were two sets of footprints, other times there was one only.<br><br>This bothered me because I noticed that during the low periods of my life,<br>when I was suffering from anguish, sorrow or defeat, I could see only one set of footprints.<br>So I said to the Lord,<br><br>"You promised me Lord, that if I followed you, you would walk with me always.<br>But I have noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there has only been one set of footprints in the sand.<br>Why, when I needed you most, have you not been there for me?"<br><br>The Lord replied,<br>"The years when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, is when I carried you."</td></tr></table><p>I mean, does anyone buy this? If I'm being helped along, if there's really this guiding hand bringing me to my denouement, why do I feel so battered? Why do I feel so abandoned. Why do I feel so deceived?</p><p>Honestly, though, I believe the poem. I don't know how I'm able to get up in the morning. I don't know how I'm able to stand up at 9:23 every Monday morning waiting for the bus. I don't know how I manage to get myself to weight training on time, biking down East Campus Rd. persistantly, with no constitution. I don't know how I'm able to be dealt setbacks and somehow manage to get back on my feet.</p><p>This is all a mystery to me, and though I assume most of the credit for this, I do believe something keeps me going.</p><p>I just wish it didn't get so bad.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Resigned</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=10','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Matchbox Twenty - <em>Back to Good</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/treeinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I had a bad day yesterday. I despise things being out of my control&#8212;or more accurately, out of my power. Basically, I missed my first class and was 20 minutes late because the sky decided it wanted to rain today, and so I couldn't take my bike to school with me. Oh, yes, and something mysterious happened to the Number 27 bus yesterday, and it was MIA, and I was standing in the rain for 20 minutes. It was not a good day.<p>Despite that, a few good things happened. I'm going to be published by next week fo sho', I think. It's an excellent profile I wrote on a very worthy Michelle Cohen, in the Health Center. I'd like to get it out Monday because I know it would be a much more effective piece than I'm sure is on the mound for Valentine's Day. She's got a condom purse that is to die for.</p><p>I also went to my first Gamma Sig function of the year. I got to see Jackie and Scotty, and of course Laura. I also met her friend Linda for the second time, and realized the whole connection she has to Justin Parker <em>again</em>, and was really embarrassed when I remembered we had already had that conversion about two years ago. I'm so forgetful. Well, she's still cool, so that's worth something.</p><p>To make up for my Lily-pissed faced, I will share a few things that bring me minimal amounts of joy nowadays. For one, sitting here in the library lounge. Happily, no one has found me here. Also, I really enjoy wasting my money at 'Tween the Pages because they sell The Righteous Juice Co.'s glorious assortment of freshly squeezed fruit juices, including my most favorite, lemonade. I also enjoy their cookies and Baked Lays (but the cookies are old and crumby today&#8212;not like Tuesday's).</p><p>And Monday, I got what I've been sorely lacking for a good six months now. Glasses! I'm so excited about these, I want to wear them at every waking moment. I am barred from such enjoyment on Monday and Wednesday, for weight training reasons. I can't wait for tomorrow though.</p><p>I made a garbage group on facebook. I hope everyone joins. I noticed there are lot of people who have listed garbage in their music interests. They had better equate that into their choice of facebook group. Of course, who else has the connection to all the garbage goodies...like this one!</p><p align="center"><img src="britshirl.jpg" width="297" height="328"></p><p>I think she looks beautiful.  I really hope that Bleed Like Me look makes a splash like Version 2.0.  Anyways, I'm going to be late to class if I don't make haste.</p><p>Adios.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Broccoli</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=9','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Gwen Stefani - <em>What You Waiting For</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/lilypissedicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'll try and make this one short and sweet.  Currently, I'm sitting in the library after eating a delicious M&amp;M and chocolate chip cookie along with a refreshing freshly squeezed lemonade and a bag of Baked Lays.  So far, I have accomplished the top two objectives on my list of &quot;things-to-do,&quot; and interestingly enough, I also ran into someone I haven't seen since my first semester here at UGA (She asked me if I was still crazy about garbage, and I think I got alittle embarrassed).<p>Well, I don't really have a heck of a whole lot to say. I'm going to try to get published before next Monday on an article that I wrote last semester. I'm also seeking the elusive graduation check I've been putting off. Oh, and I'm also determined to get Jennifer to clean the living room. We'll be talking tonight.</p><p>Catching up on things this week, don't you remember? Anyways, a few things that have been bothering me.</p><p>For one, I don't think I'll ever get used to the Ramsey locker room. Everytime I walk in there to change into my weight training garb, there's some bare-assed guy drying his nuts w/ a towel. I mean, I  like naked men as much as the next gay guy, but do I have to be bombarded with nudity as soon as I walk into the locker room? I've never been comfortable with locker rooms&#8212;there's just something too Greek about the whole thing. Why don't these guys cover themselves up, or at least try to? The less time I spend in there, the better.</p><p>Also, there are several annoying things about the iPod. For one, why is the clock a completely useless feature? It seems that my iPod randomly lets its battery supply diminish <em>even</em> when the damned thing is off, and once I've charged it again, it's time to party like it's 1999?! Well, more accurately 2000. For someone who's sworn off his beloved watch, I find this constant adjustment to be extremely bothersome.</p><p>And what's up with the thing randomly dying?! I can't tell you how many times I turned that thing on when I was waiting for the bus (keep in mind I used it maybe 2 hours the day before and supposedly turned it off), and then after turning it on, I get that obnoxious Apple logo and a little flicker. All of a sudden, I'm riding the bus without an excuse not to talk to anyone. It's just annoying, that's all.</p><p>I'm going to be late to class if I don't stop now, so toodles. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Annoyed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=8','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Do As Infinity - <em>Shinjitsu no Shi </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Saturday, I got the chance to be a part of my cousin's thesis.  She's taking pictures of lots of her friends and family, putting them in situations that best captures their personalities (though her teacher tells her she'll never be able to truly capture her subject's true personality).<p>Anyways, she was nice enough to give me the technical shots from what we did Saturday.  I've always wanted my cousin to take pictures of me.  She did a phenomenal job, and on top of that, I have some really stunning pictures of me.  No more of that tired old picture from high school graduation.</p><p>Expect a more detailed entry eventually...tonight I'm off.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
