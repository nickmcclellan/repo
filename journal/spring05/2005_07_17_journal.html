      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/athficon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Sigh, sometimes I wish I can turn back time. It's funny, for someone that's so forward looking and resigned to his fate living in worlds far from this one, you'd think I could let the past go.<p>Reading old Blogs is alittle odd. In this particular entry (circa <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/fall02/journal3.html">Fall 2002</a>) I was going on about how happy I was. How I had never been that happy in my whole life. Though I discounted it by admitting I was not completely happy (&quot;all-around&quot; happy as I put it), was I really being serious? How could I possibly fathom what happiness really was? So I partook in some innocent flirting and just happened not to roll snake eyes&#8212;so I spent and evening spooning some guy. Was I happy? Or was I just being really stupid...</p><p>I had a most bizarre run in today. I took a nap before going to dinner with Leena. I woke up, went to pee, and once I opened to door to the bathroom to go about finding my wallet and other various things I needed before I left, I was <em>attacked by a dog</em>. Yes, there was a strange dog in my room, across from the bathroom, who turned around as soon as I opened the door and began to bark incessantly at me and lunge and jump in my direction. I screamed out, &quot;Oh my God!&quot; shut the door, and shook with shock and fear.</p><p>After a few seconds, my reason began to come back. Obviously, I had not shut the front door properly and some neighborhood dog had decided to wait out the thunderstorm by gallivanting around my house. I opened the door while said dog kept barking really loud so I told him to shut up. I gave him some water and tried to share some of my banana with him (but he apparently was not a health nut). Once I found my wallet and other necessary things (all the while getting much vocal input from the dog), I took it outside, got in my car, and drove away. It was a very strange encounter.</p><p>I think I'm leaving next Friday. Wow, one week. I almost can't believe it. I really am still waiting to hear from this job I could get in New Hampshire, but apparently they are taking their time deciding on who they want to be their new copy editor. I keep e-mailing the guy and he keeps telling me I'm still a finalist and he's not yet made his decision. I have chosen to assume I haven't gotten the job just because it makes moving easier. I loathe waiting. I just don't have time anymore.</p><p>Oh, and I have decided to dump my screenname. If you want to know my new one, you're just going to have to ask me. Just to let you know, though, I plan on not being online very often in the future. If you're lucky, you're already on my buddy list. If not, well, sucks for you.</p><p>I'll see you later.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Shook</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=55','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Disintegration</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/inutreeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I have returned. I needed a break. I was kind of waiting around for something that hasn't come&#8212;something that's may still come, thankfully. I've already replaced the pronouns with something more substantial, so that's the good news.  The bad news is, unless you noticed during the one minute today I accidentally published it, the entry remains hidden. I'm so mysterious. I don't have many hidden entries. Just that one (and the other one). When I'm done, I'll be sure to leave the door unlocked.<p>I only have two weeks left. I would like to be out of here by this weekend, but that's probably not likely. Being realistic, I'd have to say that I probably won't leave until late next week. As for where I'm going, I am embarrassed to admit I still don't know. I'm thinking Ohio is still the likely candidate. I'm planning on that contingent, and up until this weekend, it was the most dismal prospect before me. Jerm called yesterday and we had a nice conversation. I think he'd certainly like me being in Dayton, and it's nice to know I'd have a friend there too. It just made me feel good, that's all. I always figured I'd have a job, but it's not a total loss if I missed out on that. Just a disappointment.</p><p>Well, before I disappeared this weekend, I had an eventful Friday night. It was <em>really</em> my last Krush Girls, I swear. I went with Leena and Marilia and I had a blast. I remembered all of it too! I should say that things got fuzzy at the end, but not nearly as bad as my tryst in June. Sigh, not much to write home about. Shirtless dancing. Long Island Iced Teas. Some guy complimented my muffin shirt. I think that was probably the best part of the night, I always wear the coolest shirts. Oh, I must not forget the pillowy lips. I couldn't resist :-*</p><p>This week I will be packing everything away. I will be finishing some website stuff too. I think this will be the week I finish my Friends Pages. I really need to see Tiffany anyways, it's been too long.</p><p>I did do something today. I got myself a radio blog since I had all the webspace and nothing to do with it. I converted my Spring '05 music into a nifty radio.blog soundtrack of my last semester at UGA. It's pretty neat, I have a very eclectic blend of music. It should make sifting through all those archives looking for hidden entries much more interesting. Be sure to check it out, it's pretty cool.</p><p>Tomorrow, I'm going to run. I'm going to clean up the house. I will have to find some boxes...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Deadened</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=54','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Ayumi Hamasaki - <em>No More Words</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
