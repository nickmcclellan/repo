      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/kagomeregreticon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />It hasn't been a good day.  For a while now, I have been having a hard time accepting frequent disappointment.  Not from whom you'd expect, I should add, but just from people who I care for and you would think care as equally for me.  I feel like I'm a good person, that I am someone who listens and tries very earnestly to make happy the people I care about.  This week, for example, I sent packages to Marilia and April (of the pervasive Peace Corps fame) at significant expense to me.  I mean, I'm not even sure if they would have gone such lengths for me, but I didn't do it for that. I don't expect something in return.  I know they deserve something special and I did everything I could to make them happy&#8212;even if it cost too much.<p>I don't think anyone would do something that special for me&#8212;or anything special for me. I even make myself very clear to the people that are capable of doing the most trivial things to give me the smallest amount of satisfaction, and I am ignored. Instead of listening to me, though, they would rather think about themselves and, as a consequence, make me feel worthless. Shouldn't my graduation be special? Don't I deserve for my most simple requests to be fulfilled? Why must I try so hard for others when no one will try for me? I know it's not much, and though they seem trivial, the fact that you ignore them hurts me very much. I don't know why I should just accept that nobody gives a damn about me. It's not fair, and I won't take it anymore.</p><p>So no, I don't care that I'm graduating tomorrow. I don't care what I'm wearing, I could give a shit which tassel graces my cap. It doesn't matter to me because it obviously doesn't matter to anyone else. I believe that if it did matter, you would do something about it and I wouldn't feel like a burden and a fool. You would listen to me instead of treating me like shit.</p><p>Anyways, I told myself I would write something before the big day. I don't think I will even show up, honestly. Who's going to notice anyways? I never said I wanted to go. It's a pointless ceremony where you sit around and listen to a bunch of boring speeches until someone hands you a piece of paper that says you graduated, which you already know, and I just don't see the point in it all. Can you believe I was asked to go to more than one of these things? I can't handle this. I just want it to be over.</p><p>And the only thing I wanted to do more than anything else today was to run. And I didn't even get to do that.</p><p>So happy graduation my fellow students. You earned it.</p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Disappointed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">garbage - <em>Medication</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

    <h3 class="post-title">Krushed</h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/ccbmessicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Oh, the craziness that was last night. As much as it would have been such a comfort that things would have happened as they usually did, I think what I got instead was alot better.  This is long, so sit back, cause it's going to be a while.<p>So I went to Krush Girls last night. My intention was the be social and dancing and just fun. I thought one more  dance with Missy would be all I needed to end this right. I didn't do that, exactly, I think that maybe all the drinking and blacking out got in the way of my fun with her. Plus, Missy has a nasty habit of leaving with some random guy, and last night was no exception. So it was just me and Leena, and boy did we have a great time...</p><p>Ok, so Friday I was dead set on having a drunken fun time. I went running because I had a really shitty Thursday night. I ate a whole box of cookies, which sounds glamorous, but it was really sad and depressing. I kept lite on the food Friday, as a result, and I went for a nice long run that helped to make me feel alot better. There were points when I almost started walking, but I perservered and ended up running the whole thing. Go me.</p><p>Missy and I went to Leena's and I had about 4 glasses of wine before diving into some Bacardi O. I tried to talk to Dille and not stutter and slur, but that was a lost cause. I kept saying things like, &quot;I don't talk bad, I am an English major...no, I have an English degree!&quot; I wasn't very convincing. I did get to kiss Leena though. She had such wonderful, pillowy lips. By the end of the night, when I was craving kisses, I just looked at her and said, &quot;Pillowy lips!&quot; and she knew it was time to fork over the goods.</p><p>On our way to Krush Girls we saw a shadowy cop down against a dark wall and I made very vocal my problem with the creepiness factor of the whole thing. I made some drunken phone calls; left a voicemail with Padmini, got to tell April I loved her. It's so nice to be in touch with her again.</p><p>The experience at the 40 Watt is a blur. I know when we got there Leena ran into her friend Aaron and Missy and I had to wait while they worked out some issues. He was so drunk, he fell on the floor right on his head. I was really adamant about how he fell right on his head, I wouldn't stop talking about it. I saw a few people that I knew and thus gave lovin' to. Julie was out last night. I know my behavior must have been a shock to her, she hasn't ever seen me off campus before. Kyle was there as well. There were a few other people I knew but didn't say hi to. I was too drunk to be too social, so don't take it personally. I couldn't really <em>see</em> people, per se&#8212;like I couldn't look for them, you know? I mean, you'd have to smack me upside the head for me to notice you, it was that bad.</p><p>I don't remember what happened to Missy once Leena came back from walking Aaron outside. I just know Leena, being the supervixen she is, got us all the way to the front by the stage where I tried to cobble together an array of pelvic thrusts to form a working dance. She requested &quot;Motown Philly&quot; from one of the guys on stage (they apparently have fond memories of Leena from New Year's). That's probably the only song I remember <em>hearing</em> that night. I wasn't paying much attention.</p><p>After that point, I was basically going back and forth from the bar and the stage. It's really bizarre, I opened a tab and started buying Leena and me Long Island Iced Teas. I know I shouldn't have done that, I had had way too much to drink at that point. I brought Leena her drink and she kept setting it down on the stage and I kept reaching for it, reminding her to finish it up. I think I even dropped my drink at some point, which I know was an annoyance to my fellow dancers (Leena said I spilt alcohol on her arm).</p><p>The highlight of the night came when I told Leena we should take off our shirts and dance. We did so for a good 5 minutes, and Leena said everyone was looking at us. Scary, like I said, I didn't really have the ability to <em>see</em> people in the state I was in, which was probably a really good thing. Leena was really hot in just her bra though, I was very impressed. We put our shirts back on, sadly, and after that, I remember <strong>nothing</strong>. I was impressed by the fact that though I blacked out, I had the good sense to close my tab. How much does that rock? </p><p>From what I've put together from what Leena and Gen told me, we waited around for a while after the lights came on to look for Missy. Gen called me and I kept asking her if she knew where Missy was. Despite the fact that she told me that Missy had got to Spring Lake with some guy, it didn't sink in for me, so I kept asking her, all the while referring to Gen as Leena or Missy (I apparently forget people's names when I black out). Leena  scored me a free tofu dog while she was making out with this guy Winston on a bench. I really resent not being aware of such a delicious experience (the tofu dog, not the making out). It was my first tofu dog and I can't even remember what it tasted like! After that, I apparently pulled Leena off the boy and we somehow got home (though both of us don't remember how).</p><p>Leena says when I got to her place I insisted on taking a shower. I'm really impressed that I was able to do that and somehow manage to get all my clothes back on (except my pants) without putting anything on backwards or something. I fell asleep on Leena's chair. I woke up in the most uncomfortable position too. I don't know why my drunk self didn't take advantage of the couch a mere 3 feet away. What can I say, I'm just an idiot.</p><p>So, after some lengthy debriefing with Leena, I finally managed to get back to Spring Lake to my car. I went out to breakfast with Gen, Missy, Adam, and Claire and we had the usual fun making fun of Missy. Padmini called and said she'd do the biking at the Greenway with me today. I was so into that, so once I got home, I suited up and biked my little toushie about 8 miles to her house. It was a very pleasant ride (though I was still hungover and very dizzy).</p><p>We had a nice chat at the Greenway. Poor Padmini had problems keeping up with me and she kept apologizing, but I told her it was ok. She's so cute, I told her if she started riding her bike to school, she be in so much shape. She just needs to get over the whole fear of cars. That's something I accomplished long ago. Your automobile doesn't scare me!</p><p>After I rode the whole 8 miles back to my house, I took a shower and got in a long nap. I wanted to finish this admittedly lengthy entry before midnight, but I guess that didn't work. I had a good time today and last night, so good for that. Expect more nostalgia this week probably. Graduation is Saturday, isn't that scary?</p><p>It will all be over soon. </p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Depressed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">New Order - <em>Who's Joe</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/archive.html">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
