      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/treeinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />It really was a beautiful day today. In fact, it's been nice ever since the dial changed from cruel winter to forgiving spring. When I went out to lunch with John and Ben on Friday, Ben took a look out the window and said, &quot;This weather would put anyone in a good mood.&quot; That got me thinking. Am I in a good mood? Do I really prefer a sunny day to a severe thunderstorm?<p>I don't know. But I did take advantage of the day. I did some extra credit running with Genevieve on the 4 mile route. I also did some weights with Jerm and some swimming too. I feel all good now, and I even noticed I lost 3 pounds. So, in that respect&#8212;in the only thing I have any control over&#8212;I did have a good day. The weather was pleasant too.</p><p>As I mentioned yesterday, I got Firefox. I didn't give it much of a look, but after wrestling with my Blog's CSS yesterday, I was unable to give my Mozilla viewers the joy of a semi-transparent layout. I guess that's just what you get for using a browser that doesn't know how to make text opaque.</p><p>Yeah, so consider this my endorsement of a guarded Internet Explorer. Sure, it's got lots of holes, but that's only because they've got about every virus writer in the world gunning to take down the big one. Maybe if Mozilla could differentiate from transparent background and opaque text, it would be riddled with ruthless attacks as well. Hopefully those mousy Firefox programmers will give me my opaque text, and I'll join my fellow indie-browser elite. In the meantime, I'll be with good ol' E (but I will be reading the news on Firefox. That &quot;open as tabs&quot; option is really cool).</p><p>Well, I should go. All this running is bound to make me tired. Hope everyone has a chocotastic Easter. I've got my basket.</p><p>See you mister chicken.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Thoughtful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=21','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">3 Doors Down - <em>Let Me Go</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 It Doesn't Matter
	 
    </h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/rainbowinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />What am I supposed to say?  I don't really know.  I was almost compelled Tuesday to say something.  I even made this flashy new icon and everything.  Nothing came out though.  I just sort of settled down on the concrete like some forgotten autumn leaf in spring.  But, let's not forget, what was neglected and ignored yesterday&#8212;when we needed it the most&#8212;is something different and unseeming today.  It's almost as if I wasn't angry at all.  Or hurt.  Or in desperate need.<p>I just feel now so forgotten.  I don't know if it would be worse otherwise. All I have this heavy burden of considering that it just doesn't matter. It's not like that changes anything, it's not like I'm still not strong or that I won't try. It's just, what does it take exactly? When are you desperate enough for something truly incredible? Does it just happen to you, like a missed bus or a rainy day, or do you earn it? Is it possible to do just enough to deserve it? I don't know. But enough of that.  That was yesterday, this is today.</p><p>Last night, I went out with John Lynch. It's so nice having him in town. I miss people like him. We got to have dinner and wine with Ben, and we went to Room Thirteen by Clocked. I had many alcoholic beverages, but I wasn't drunk.  It was the first time I have had alcohol in a long time. I wasn't missing much.</p><p>And I wasn't missing much by abstaining from Boneshakers this semester. What a stank hole. There was barely anyone there, except for Kyle. There's always that one old fat guy who's balding and walks around hugging all the younger guys who always sends this strange leading stare at me. I swear to God, if he touched me, I would have decked him. I just don't like that place anymore.</p><p>By the way, I downloaded Firefox this week, and I noticed my website looks like complete shit in it. Please, I know you pretentious Firefox users <em>love</em> your bug-free browser, but don't judge my design abilities from what you see in it. Take a look at the site in Internet Explorer. I promise, it will be worth the beauteous look at the face of God (well, maybe not that good).</p><p>I ran 6 miles today, so I'm going to lay down and maybe munch on some Easter candy my mother sent me. I'll maybe write some more tonight. Almost done, so good for me.</p><p>I'll try to Blog tomorrow&#8212;just to give this week some symmetry. Yay for that.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Exhausted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=6','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Lovesong</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
