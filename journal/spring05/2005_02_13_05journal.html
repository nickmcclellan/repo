    <h3 class="post-title">Why Do You Love Me?</h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/brandylj.jpg" width="100" align="left" /><strong>They're playing garbage on the radio!</strong></p><p>Finally! I got to hear the new single, &quot;Why Do You Love Me.&quot; It was so awesome too, it couldn't have happened any better. I got a call from Jennifer during my ESOL class, and I called her afterward to ask her what she wanted. She asked me if there was a new garbage album coming out, and I was like, &quot;What? Well, yes. Why do you ask?&quot;<p>Suddenly, it hit me. She'd heard the song before me! <em>Who hears a garbage song before I do??</em> I was obviously very peeved. It turns out she had heard a DJ on 99X boasting that he had the song and would play it every hour. I listened to the station all the way home from class.</p><p>Just after I was getting of the loop at College Station, it happened. I heard the song! It was the first new garbage song since I downloaded a rough cut of &quot;Androgyny&quot; in my basement in Marietta, just a week before I went off to UGA. That was a very impersonal moment. Hearing it off of my laptop speakers just seemed unnatural and artificial, and I think that might be the reason &quot;Androgyny&quot; never really grew on me.</p><p>Hearing &quot;Why Do You Love Me&quot; in my car was so much more fun! I nearly got in an accident weaving through calls, singing along, &quot;I get back up, and I do it again!&quot; This single is different than &quot;Androgyny&quot;, too. For one, my first impression of the song is that it's lacking alot of the bells and whistles of songs from albums like Version 2.0 and Beautifulgarbage. It's very high energy, and reminds me of &quot;Push It&quot;, but not nearly as dark. There's alot of pop in the song, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It's got a whole lot more rock to back it up. It's loud, it's obnoxious, and Shirley's angry.</p><p>I do actually have a copy of the lyrics. I don't think it's the most impressive lyrical piece on the album, for sure. I was at first alittle phased by some of their choice of words, but I think the energy is what really brings the song together, and I can certainly see myself speeding down the highway listening to this, or trekking very swiftly through campus on my bike. I absolutely can't wait til' I have the mp3. For the next week, I'm a WinMX junkie. Someone leak it, fast!</p><p>I maintain that I'm  going to be unspoiled on this album. I refuse to download anything that will not be released on a single before April 12th, when the album is released. I hear that they will be releasing a US single in March, so I will actually have the opportunity to legitimately purchase it and rip the b-sides. Oh, I can't wait for new b-sides! It's going to be an exciting year! I love it when a new garbage album comes out. This is the second one for me, so I'm really going to enjoy it!</p><p>Another reason for the Brandy face is the fact that I had a really productive day, and I made it all the way up to Park Hall on my bike. I usually get really tired after my work out and make it to Journalism to walk the rest of the way. I felt like pushing it today though, and I made it to class early for once. And I got to go to lunch with Leena, which is so much fun :-D</p><p>Well, it's time to be miserable again. Adios. </p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td>  <td align="right">Good</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td>  <td align="right">garbage - <em>Why Do You Love Me </em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

He's probably right.<p>Is that a bad thing? I don't really think so. I have my eye on this Media Matters internship, but maybe that's just because my eyes don't have many places to go. I think I'm going to talk to Dr. Martin again about the whole thing.  Maybe after I have a few more clips and experience under my belt, I won't feel so worthless sitting in front of him.</p><p>This isn't a bad thing, trust me. Worrying about what I'm going to do after school is not going to make any difference. Just to be safe, I e-mailed the Flagpole to see about any copy editing things I might be able to do. How <em>studious</em> am I??</p><p>I think I'm going to start on the Freshman Blog soon. Basically, for every semester, I'm going to do a little Blog retrospective, with reflections on the year. I think the Freshman Blog is going to be the most fun to do. What sucked about freshman year? Absolutely nothing (except for that day I puked all over my bed and got pulled over when I was on my way to Wal-Mart to get Resolve carpet cleaner). I may even go back and modernize the old Blogs and fix up the massive HTML errors. Oh, what work there's to be done...</p><p>I have to write my first paper tonight.  I'm not looking forward to it. I'm going to do some cardio w/ Jerm at the gym just to get away from it for a few hours.<p>Tomorrow, I'm going out to lunch with Leena. I even got my hair cut for her. It looks very mod&#8212;that's the first thing I said.<p>It appears this Blog entry has collapsed in on itself like a neutron star, so I'm going to head to class now...listening to Japanese mp3's...but to you, it won't appear so, because I have reported something different!<p>It appears today is <strong>not</strong> your day.</p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td align="right">Separate</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td align="right">Kim Ferron - <em>Nothing But You </em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

Is it that it's Monday?  Personally, I think the most distressing thing about today was the fact that it was raining.  That was reason enough for me to stay in bed.<p>There's one thing that doesn't disappoint. I *heart* going to my weight training class. I'm showing some progress, and this weekend, I was able to finish a set on the bench of 65 lbs. I did it today too, but I struggled on 70 and 75 lbs. I'm glad that I'm getting better. I'm noticing it physically as well. I think it's giving me some more energy, because I'm pretty sure I'm sleeping less (which isn't the best thing). Tomorrow's an early day though. No need for sleep tonight.<p>I fixed Jerm's computer last night&#8212;<em>correction</em>&#8212;I <strong>started</strong> to fix the dang thing, and will complete my work as soon as I have more time. For one, the guy had 23 Windows updates that he hadn't downloaded in addition to Service Pack 2. I told him, after updating his neglected computer, that his browser was protected from future hijackers. Now it's just about gutting out all the nastiness that infects his computer now. Absolutely filthy.<p>I'm also going to make Jerm work out with me. I'm really looking forward to this. I want to see my friends get all buff like me :-)<p>Last night, while I was working on Jerm's computer, I sent some mass invites over facebook for my garbage group. I feel it's much less futile with now 26 members than it was with a measly 3. If you haven't joined already, well, shame on you.<p>And check out this New Order song. I just love it.<blockquote><em>Just wait til' tomorrow<br>I guess that's what they all say<br>Before they fall apart...</em></blockquote><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td align="right">Medium Cheese Pizzas</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td align="right">New Order  - <em>Regret</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p></p><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/archive.html">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
