      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/twineicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />It doesn't get much better than this. Right now, it's raining. It's a very special down pour, though. It's going to freeze. In a matter of hours, the light icy layer that's coating Athens streets will become too perilous to travel on. Driving conditions in the morning will force businesses to close. People unwilling to risk the slick roads will instead retreat indoors. And the best part is: it's not going to stop. It just keeps on coming.<p>I don't want to do anything tomorrow. I probably wouldn't have done anything anyways, but there would have been that pressure&#8212;that little twitch inside that insists I do something. Fortunate for me, tomorrow will be spent indoors for a very good reason. I can't wait to get drossy in the next hour, curl up in bed, and wake up tomorrow with absolutely nothing on my agenda but avoiding the ice. That just makes me happy.</p><p>Sure, tomorrow is Saturday. It's naturally a day off, but something's different when the entire day is scrapped because of weather. Sure, I know what you're going to say, wouldn't it be better if it was on a Monday? I agree, I think this would be more <em>useful</em> on a Monday, but let's consider what we have here. Saturday is a great day to relax and unwind from the week, but how many people actually do that? How often do you complicate your weekend with the week's unfinished business? I take comfort in the fact that this weekend, there's every reason in the world to do absolutely nothing.</p><p>Well, that's all I have to say about the freezing rain. In other weather related news, I made the bonehead decision of riding my bike home from school today. I mean, I get out of my Chaucer class at 2:15, and the bus doesn't pick me up until close to 3, and that's not alot of down time. For some reason, though, I wanted to get home just alittle faster. I really just cringed at the though of going to the SLC for a matter of minutes when I could spend that time going home. It just happened that today was the coldest day next to Monday, and I didn't even have my earmuffs with me. Oh, yah, and did anyone get a blast of arctic wind while they were on their way home? Oh, that's right. You drove yourself home. Smart cookie.</p><p>Last night, I almost broke down and tried to download one of the new garbage songs. Did anyone realize that garbage was coming out with a new album this year? I started the normal routine today actually. I now visit the garbage message board during my normal round on the Internet for the latest news on album reviews, leaks, and b-side appearances. The first single is called &quot;Why Do You Love Me?&quot;, and I hear the album is alot darker than beautifulgarbage. I really can't wait to hear it, I think garbage just isn't resonating with me these days. beautifulgarbage feels so much like my first year at UGA, and that's so long ago, it's so hard to break into that again. I want a new addiction.</p><p>I really hope I can contain my anticipation. I want to buy the album on April 12th, listen to it from beginning to end&#8212;completely unspoiled&#8212;so I can truly hear the album as a whole. We'll see if that works out.</p><p>Be safe in the storm, and make sure you take some time out to revel in our frozen world. Goodnight.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Devastated</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=5','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Thirteen</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/kikyowhiteicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I called Laura yesterday. I really want to do something to her website&#8212;something big, like I mentioned. She seemed into it, and she's actually got her resume to post on it, so as soon as she's done polishing that, I'm going to put it up for her. She's coming to town a week from Saturday to take pictures for her thesis. She didn't want to bother me, with me in school and all, so she didn't mention it to me. I told her I would like to be a part of the thesis if she still wanted me. So, I get to be in her thesis! I'm going to be a part of art.<p>I suppose it's not as easy as that. She just wants me to come into town that day to take some pictures. I'm sure it will be grueling. She photographed me and my sister during the Winter break for some photos she wanted to send to my mother as a Christmas present. It took alot longer than I thought it would, but it was a very interesting experience to see my cousin doing what she does best. She's very talented, and I look forward to seeing the pictures. She told me she was working on them last night.</p><p>I have to hold an object in my hands&#8212;something that represents me and my personality. She asked if I had a journal of some kind that I wrote in, and as a matter of fact, I do. It's not the same journal from years ago, it's new. I told her it wasn't a crappy piece from Wal-Mart, that it had a personality that would really suit her project. It's nice, I got it from Urban Outfitters. I wish they had one of those places here. I mean, they're expensive, but they have some real quality stuff. Stuff with personality.</p><p>I plan on finishing the revamped Friends Page by Sunday. I'm going to do some photography myself with Marilia on Sunday. And on Saturday, I'm going to see Dina and get a copy of a photo that belongs on my website. I'm also waiting for some photos from Dille, who's taking her sweet time, but I'm not going to rush her! I may just have to start hacking into a certain facebook or Friendster to see if I can scrounge up some photos of her. Also, Vicki, Missy, Rachel, and Melissa are to be done, but I'm sure I have enough for them already. Just need to get around to it...</p><p>Off to class.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Resistant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=4','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Daniel Bedingfield - <em>If You're Not the One </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/ccbmessicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I feel like I've been hiding lately. I mean, I'm not opposed to such a notion. I feel like hiding. I think I hide someplace new every semester. Last semester, it was in the SLC. Have you ever slept in the chairs in the SLC on the fourth floor? I have. It's actually quite nice. I remember, last year before we got the SOAR award, I had spent the previous night doing a paper, and I was sleeping up there before I went down to accept the award. It's quite comfortable.<p>Well, the big news is that I have decided to convert to vegetarianism. It's not quite as big as it sounds, though. I've always said it was something I saw myself doing one day. I guess it was Genevieve who really turned me onto it&#8212;though a few others gave me a nudge or two. For one, I heard that when you stop eating meat, it's like you <em>feel</em> alot healthier. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I certainly feel different. Also, I really hate to prepare meat, I have never been very into that. It's so disgusting. Honestly, it really hasn't been that difficult to convert. I've been eating lots of fruits and veggies, and I tend to prepare more meals at home. It's been a really positive thing, so far.</p><p>Also, this week, our heater is on the fritz. I spent Saturday and Sunday night in a very deep freeze. I stacked blanket upon blanket to keep me from waking up with the chills. My roommates were obviously upset, but I was a bit <em>cooler</em> about the whole situation. I called the landlord on Sunday and he was nice enough to get the heat guy out that afternoon. The heater worked for a few hours before going kaput again. At this point, Jennifer was screaming for blood (at about 10 p.m.), but I told her calling the landlord and waking him up wasn't going to do any good. Last night, I figured out how to get the heat to work at least for short intervals. Luckily, it carried on through the night before going out this afternoon. I hope this isn't permanent.</p><p>I want to go the the Canterbury Tales thing tomorrow night at Tate! Does anyone want to go? I mean, if you do, all you have to do is use that nifty comments feature that I changed my whole <em>frickin' </em>Blog to accommodate. I don't mind an anonymous post now and then. I can always delete them of course :-D</p><p>I'll close with another peak at a Friends Page. I'm especially proud of <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/gen.html" target="_blank">Genevieve</a>'s page. So check it out.</p><p>Until next time. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Restless</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/darkkagomeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I've been pretty numb lately. I admit that I have Senioritus, and I'm not really giving classes as much emphasis as I probably should be. I mean, it's the third week, I have some things to do, but considering all I've been through, I just know things are going to be alright. I was playing &quot;what if&quot; with my mother this weekend, telling her that if I failed my Women and Chaucer class, I'd still have a degree in Newspapers. She wasn't amused&#8212;but come on! Am I going to fail?? I don't think so.<p>Basically, I've been plugging away at Friends Pages. I'd like to have the revamped section up by Friday. That would be nice. Right now, I have nine pages left to do&#8212;two of which I'm creating. I e-mailed Mary-Kate and told her I wanted a picture of her so I could introduce my website to her glorious presence. She's not around Athens anymore, and I really miss her.</p><p>It always turns out that after I've labored so strenuously on an update, I decide that my website is inadequate :-/ I mean, I really need to practice my CSS, this site is good, granted, I mean, it looks pretty amazing. I've never done anything as amazing as this, but I could do so much more with CSS. I wouldn't have to labor as much, and I might just inch closer and closer to the 21<sup>st</sup> century. I think I may have to buy a book or maybe screw with some of my pages, playing around. Who knows if the final update will be CSS. I might make it exclusively HTML&#8212;just because this website is based on a very simple design. I mean, when I'm out of this place and I purchase my own webspace (like Jerm!), I think I'll set the bar alittle higher. For now, I think I'll just play around with CSS. There's no rush.</p><p>I was thinking about my cousin's page last week. I was thinking, in the interest of building my resume, I can make that page look just phenomenal. It would take alot of work, but it really is alot of fun. I love working with my webpage and such, but working with content that I have less control over is just exhilarating. I mean, it's like I look at her photography, and I'm like, &quot;What kind of a webpage does this make?&quot; If you haven't checked it out, you must see the <a href="http://www.rsad.edu/~ljones1/" target="_blank">Photography of Laura Jones</a>.</p><p>The weight-training hell continues. I was in so much pain this weekend, but it finally subsided by Sunday. I went back today, but who knows if I will be miserable tomorrow. Let's just say, I can't bench press crap. My partner was like, &quot;Take the bar down, and then explode up!&quot; Unfortunately, all my explosions were spent, and he did most of the lifting :-/</p><p>He did say one thing. He said I'm going to be so strong by the end of the semester. I sure hope so, I'm in the mood to do something amazing&#8212;I want to change my life.</p><p>In other news, I'm a vegetarian now. Surprise, surprise.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Hopeless</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=3','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Killers - <em>Smile Like You Mean It</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
