    <h3 class="post-title">Finally</h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/redicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'm feeling very strange.  Who really cares about school anymore?  I mean, all you dedicated undergrads with one or two more years left to suffer through, I suppose I can understand that, but I'm so over it now.  I've secured my A in English, attended the Fink farewell, and I've studiously sent out my resume to several potential employers.<p>I sent one today to a paper in Pennsylvania, 90 minutes from New York and Boston.  I know, I know, it might not be glamorous, but I think it's close enough to civilization for me to tool around for about 2 years before I hit up a major metropolitan daily.  I won't mention the two jobs I applied for in NYC&#8212;they're long shots w/ big time publishers, but I know I can do the job.  I just hope all this good karma I have starts working its magic.  A Brandy face, any day now... </p><p>Other than all that, I have some editing to do before my portfolio is due tomorrow. I know I can do it, I just don't care very much about it. Like I said, I just don't care anymore. There's a final Friday. Afterward, Gen's going somewhere to pick up a puppy. I think I'll tag along. Friday night, it's the last Krush Girls, for me at least. I think I'm going to do it. I'm going to get all tipsy and cute and dance like the brave little toaster that I know I am, and I'm going to pretend everything is good again. Maybe, for one night, it will be enough just to pretend :-)</p><p>After that, <em>nothing!</em> A whole week before graduation and all I have to do is pester companies to pay me money in exchange for my valuable service. My mom is coming next week, so I think I'll have some stuff to do. My cousin and aunt are coming to see me graduate. I bought my cap and gown the other day to show off to them. Just so you know, it wasn't cheap! I had to buy two tassels because I didn't know which degree to tout&#8212;English or Journalism. I got two degrees, so I figure I deserve two tassels.</p><p>Monday night was the Red &amp; Black end of semester shindig at Taco Stand. I went, recalling awkward cast parties from that musical I did back in high school. I didn't &quot;belong&quot; there, I don't know many of the people. I knew enough to be welcome, at least. That's one thing I did this year that I should be really proud of. Ever since I was a freshman, I wanted to be on staff at the Red &amp; Black. I accomplished that this semester, and that's pretty cool. I wrote headlines, positioned some dueling mugs, and had my name published each and every day. How much does that rock!</p><p>Running goes well. I do it faster now, didn't you know? Well I do. Apparently, running shirtless doesn't tan me enough. Fuck it. If I have to be pale, I don't care. I tried.</p><p>Also, Marilia's birthday is today! Happy Birthday girl. I'm sending her a care package (don't worry, she knows cause I told her when she talked to me for an hour on Tuesday night). It will be a surprise. I hope it makes her happy.</p><p>I think I'll go to bed early and edit in the morning. Send me all your job wishes! I hope to settle that before I go to Europe. Then, all will be well.</p><p>Maybe I'll put up my poem tomorrow...if Padmini workshops it in time. Expect that very soon. Later. </p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Sick</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">BoA - <em>Every Heart</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

    <h3 class="post-title">I Know Tofu</h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/rainbowinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />So many ways to title this. I suppose that, in light of the tofu party and the Athens Twilight, this is the most witty and appropriate.  And, of course, it did come from me.<p>Well, the day started out very well with the 5K. I was very charged and ready to go. It's too bad it started to rain about half way. I somehow managed to make it though. I did random on my Super Playlist on my now obviously waterproof iPod. I started with &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; and ripped into &quot;Bad Boyfriend.&quot; It was an amazing, exhilarating feeling during that song in particular. For a moment, it seemed all the hard work and merciless sacrifice I have offered all semester was coming to something palpable and real. I felt an amazing sense of pride leaving so many people in my dust. Somehow, though, it's never enough.</p><p>The race ended with &quot;Cup of Coffee,&quot; which is an all too fitting reminder of that which I can't escape. It's a shame, really. I had bananas and Powerade, so that was at least something. I went home, soaked from the rain, and took a nice nap and iced my aching knee.</p><p>The tofu party was really something. Everyone made the food at my house and we all had a nice time preparing it. It's a shame my house is so messy, I wish when my friends came over I could clean up better. I really liked the yeast gravy we made. I saved some for veggies later. I've also become addicted to pita bread and hummus. I made my friends watch some Aqua Teen, and I think they liked it. After that, it was on to the Criterium.</p><p>Ok, the race was great, but the real entertainment was the announcer. He came up with phrases like, &quot;Pain Coma,&quot; and &quot;Downtown Pain City.&quot; I couldn't decide if he was a complete idiot or a genius among men. Everytime the frantic racers would slide by, the announcer would say something like, &quot;He's having his cake and eating it...and he's eating yours too!&quot; Very odd. I did enjoy myself, I just wish the 5K race made me feel better.</p><p>Missy said she's seen a big improvement in me this year, so I guess that's nice. I want to step up my running a notch. I think I run too slow. My endurance is awesome, but I need to learn to push it alot more. Maybe my next race will be alot better.</p><p>I'm going to buy my ticket to Europe today or this week at the latest. I want to go for about a month (maybe less). Nicole has got me on the kick of going alone. It's kind of scary, but she says that you meet alot of people in youth hostels, and I would probably meet a nice person to go sight-seeing with. I'm a solitary guy anyways, I really want to write and reflect and just do something crazy. There's always Nicole in Angers, so if I get too messed up out there, I have some place to go. I plan to leave around June 1st.</p><p>Also, some light website news: I plan to Blog into this summer. I feel I haven't reached a stopping point. Graduation will be grand, but there's still some big things I'd like to settle before putting a fork in all this. Getting a job. Going to Europe. Leaving this hell hole. I'd like to get all of that in. Oh, and there's also the Junior and Senior Blogs. The Junior Blog will be out this week, I swear! I am just having writer's block. I should be getting over that very soon.</p><p>Ok, time for bed. Second to last day copy editing tomorrow. Sadness :-( </p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Hurt</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">garbage - <em>Bad Boyfriend </em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/archive.html">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
