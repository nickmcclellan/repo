      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/kakikyoicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Somehow, I cannot leave this week with just one entry.  That was never my intention, but I don't know, I just haven't been in the mood to write.  I feel I have suffered a bit of a setback since Sunday, and hopefully next week I will be full-speed ahead.  I'm hoping for more tales of intrigue and awesomeness.<p>Yeah, I make up words. What of it?</p><p>We did do our first ESOL class this week. Diane and I did well without Rand. I felt like maybe she carried the class, though, and hopefully I can work on that. I think I was just tired&#8212;I've been a bit downtrodden all week. For one, we arrived in our familiar classroom in the section I very plainly remembered signing up for: Basic IA. I intentionally signed up for this section because I'm a facebiter, of sorts, and didn't want to be far from Jerm's section, whom I imitate in just about every way possible (though, I'd like to think, even that's a two way street).</p><p>Well, so these girls walk in the room, right, just as I'm tearing the annoying paper off of the crappy pieces of chalk they give us. One of them says, &quot;Are you in the right section?&quot; looking at me as I imagine her twirling her hair with her fingers while obnoxiously chewing gum.</p><p>&quot;Yes, I'm pretty sure.&quot; I say, as Diane clings to my side, obviously inspired by my resolute and commanding response to these fearsome she-wolves threatening our herd of students. I don't know what Diane would do without her confident and strong male sidekick to keep the students and bothersome teachers in line.</p><p>Anyways, it turns out those she-devils had the schedule changed so they got Basic IA. I was alittle puzzled, I knew something must have shifted, because I requested specifically Jerm's section, and she was like, &quot;Oh, I know, aren't they nice? I've been e-mailing them. They're very helpful.&quot; No crap, Barbie, why do you think I <em>requested</em> the section?!&quot;</p><p>So, we got Basic IB, which turned out to be ok. I mean, it was smaller, which almost had me at that girl's throat for some of her students, but I think it will be a good group. I told Diane we should start out with lots of English to assert that this is an English class, and English will be the primary language spoken. The bulk of the lesson we taught was over introductions, and oddly enough the English pronouns and the verb &quot;to be.&quot; Our last class showed scarcely an interest in grammar, I was surprised to see this year's crop so intrigued by verb conjugations and agreement. I think I'll be a bit more threatening on the whole &quot;English-only&quot; thing toward the middle of the semester.  I mean, those ladies looked at me when I was introducing myself like, &quot;<em>I don't know what you're saying!</em>&quot; Er, or maybe, &quot;<em>&iexcl;No conozco las palabras que est&aacute;n sabiendo su boca!</em>&quot;</p><p>I think I've been alittle hostile lately. It's troubling me, I don't know where all this anger is coming from, but I am not very patient with things as of late. It's not always a bad thing, though. For the past two days, I rode my bike the whole 6 miles home from school. Thursday, it was cold and everything, and I got out of my class earlier than expected. I just didn't feel like waiting around for 25 minutes just to wait around even more sitting on the bus. Today, though, I just missed the bus and was sure as hell not going to wait a whole hour for it to come around again. I almost caught up with it too...</p><p>I'm going to the gym now...horray for learning hot to bench more than 55 lbs!</p><p><strong>P. S.</strong>: Any misogyny is entirely coincidental and in no way indicative of my denigrating and demeaning attitude toward women. You militant lesbians were never able to take a joke, anyways. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Impatient</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=7','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Do As Infinity - <em>Fukai Mori</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 The Silence of the Lambdas

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/athficon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Just to let you all know, I have given up on the <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/" target="_blank">Friends Page</a>. Ok, well, not exactly given up, per se, but I'm not going to force myself to finish everything to compromise superior content. I did bust my ass to do pages for Laura and Mary-Kate, which I promised I'd do a long time ago, and I did a much needed update to alot of pages (Genevieve's page <em>really</em> needed it). You can check out my hard labors by clicking on the above link, underlined for your convenience (Thank you CSS!)<p>The rumblings of a party are brewing in the back of my mind. Marilia is leaving on the 23rd for Chile, and I want to have a party for her. She seems to want to see everyone there, so I guess she can have one last swipe at them&#8212;something like that. Well, no, I think she just wants to have a good time. I was thinking today I probably can't muster the numbers I used to be able to, but I think maybe I can make an earnest effort to bring some action to a dull Spring Semester. When's the last time anything interesting happened, anyways?</p><p>I promised myself I wouldn't say anything about this, but where's the fun in not throwing salt in the wound, right? Some interesting e-mails came out last night about the state of the Lambda Alliance. Basically, it's arguable whether things have taken a turn for the worse. Attendance hasn't been stellar since even I was a board member. I think it's pointless to point the finger (per se), but I do believe this version of the organization really does need to die. I don't think the current crop (minus Kyle, who I have an obnoxious admiration of) really knows what the campus needs from a GLBT organization. I'm not Mr. Know-It-All, either, for that matter. I think it's up to the freshman, as bad as that sounds. I think after a real time of death and renewal, Lambda will be very different from what we all recognize.</p><p>And what's this I hear about the emphasis returning the the Lambda Office? Wow, is that a delayed echo, or was someone finally listening to three generations of dearly departed Board members. Just indifference here though, I did my part for king and country. And, as far as anyone else is concerned, I did it well.</p><p>I'll be working on the Galleries Page now. If anyone happens to have any me-related pictures they'd like to send my way, don't hesitate. I could really use the content.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Empty</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=6','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Lovesong</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
