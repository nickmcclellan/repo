      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/wdylmshirlicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I had planned a fabulous tofu party Saturday.  I invited Diane, and we were going to learn how to make tofu with Padmini.  We had never learned.  I have all the ingredients, of course, but I'm afraid I won't grasp the technique straight off. I figured Padmini  would be able to show us.  Well, *past perfect tense* <em>had planned</em> a tofu party this Saturday.  That has been postponed.<p>Expatriate <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/nicole.html" target="_blank">Nicole</a> is back in the USA! She called me today and we talked while I was on the way home. It's so nice to have her back. She's having a cookout on Saturday, so I have to go back to see her. I mean, I haven't seen her in almost two years, can you believe that? I mean, the last time she saw me, I had gotten my face burned off from that horrible flaming shot of Everclear. <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/Spring%2003/7-6journal.html" target="_blank">Remember that??</a></p><p>Well, besides expatriate best friend news, Wednesday was my last ESOL class. This week wasn't anything special, but I do want to say something about the experience as a whole.</p><p>I didn't want to do anything this year. No leadership. No Lambda and its fucking politics. Only me and what would get me into my career. Diane told me last fall that she was going to an info meeting on teaching English to speakers of other languages and I told her I'd go along (half thinking I'd probably duck out or something). Jerm has been doing ESOL since the fall of 2003. He would do them when I hosted Lambda meetings, and I'd beg him to come, and he'd tell me, &quot;It's more important than Lambda.&quot; I never believed him. Certainly my hard work for Lambda was more important than some boring community service.</p><p>Needless to say, last fall was a complete hell for me. Not many know the full story (though I may elaborate in the Senior Blog), but there was one thing that never felt sullied or forsaken. Every Thursday night, when I would met up with Diane and teach a roomful of people basic English skills, I felt good about myself. I felt that, despite the burden of outrageous circumstances that I had to endure, I was untouchable and free for that one hour and thirty minutes every week. Nothing could discredit the good I was doing. No one could deny that I had done a selfless thing.</p><p>Last year, when I was an officer for Lambda, I rarely felt that. I instead felt embattled and pressured to do what others thought I was supposed to do. It was like any real difference we made with any individual was immaterial to getting a body to fill a space in a room. Though I tend to gauge my Lambda experience by personal, meaningful moments (meeting Antonio, watching the selfish freshman meet their life-long  friends at the Lambda picnic we organized though they deny Lambda ever had any value for them ever), as a whole, it never really mattered on the larger cosmic scale. It was never enough. </p><p>I guess I'm happy I did something this year that truly did. ESOL meant something, and I'm glad I could be a part of it.</p><p>I showed Martin my resume today. He liked it, he liked my design examples, and he commended me on my desire to evacuate the south. He said so many graduates get jobs in Georgia and they're unwilling to go out into the world and experience it. I am glad I'm leaving. To tell you the truth, I can't wait. I wish I could have left months ago.</p><p>Also, Marilia called last night and we talked for almost 2 hours. I love my expatriate friends. Just because they left the country doesn't mean I would ever forget them. Oh, and she's got facebook now, so add her! Add her because you <em>know</em> she's sexy!</p><p>I should sleep now. I can't believe I finished the Fink paper early. I shouldn't have got ice cream, though. Bad me.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Flighty</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=30','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Run Baby Run </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/buffybrokenicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Wow, so Garbage Week is over.  It is unfortunate, I must admit that Blogging was never more fun.  I know, I know, it was probably the most uninteresting, drab, and overwritten week I've ever produced, but I loved it.  It's something I can look back on and smile about.  Heck, that's the whole fucking website, right?  I revel in the useless and forgotten!<p>Anyways, in the aftermath of the new garbage album, I find I can't listen to anything else. I knew this was going to happen. I think I'll separate myself from <em>Bleed Like Me</em> enough to run my 6 miles with a smart playlist on my iPod or something. I mean, if a garbage song just randomly pops in there, it's not my fault, right? I went looking for New Order's <em>Waiting for the Siren's Call</em> on Saturday because I saw it was released on iTunes, but apparently the CD isn't released until next week. What's up with that? I mean, mp3's are great and all, but I prefer to rip, not download. It just feels so much cooler.</p><p>Well, I wanted to go into some of the most interesting points of last week. It was pretty cool afterall. Tuesday was really long. I got up early to get the garbage album and I had my resume looked at one more time. I want to send it out to five jobs I found over the weekend. I'm aiming for locales far from Georgia because I quite honestly can't stand it here. I want to go some place different where I can start my career but also where I don't have to feel cut off from the world. I certainly don't want to spend anymore time in Athens, that's for sure.</p><p>On Wednesday, I went to yet another exhaustive day of class. I went up in weight, at least. Can you believe I'm benching 125?? Maybe no one knows what that means, and even if you did, you'd know it wasn't much. I've come a long way since the beginning of the semester, and that's something to be proud of.</p><p>Also, the running is going along really well. Another 6 miles Wednesday, but something very interesting happened. I <em>thought</em> the ominous storm on the radar would just slink on by north of me, but that didn't happen. About three miles from my house, I noticed in the distance what looked like large and heavy droplets of rain. As we all know, it turned out to be hail. I mean, you have to picture this. There I am, in the midst of some nasty downpour of hail protecting my iPod, cowering under a tree shirtless and wishing I hadn't been such a bonehead and stayed home to be lazy. A nice couple came to my rescue and invited me into their home and gave me a towel to dry off. They were really cool. After the storm subsided, I was off and running again, faster than usual. I wanted to get home out of the further threat of nastiness, ASAP.</p><p>I talked to Laura Wednesday when my sister and I were out to dinner at this restaurant called Maggiano's. She told me the picture she took of me for her thesis was chosen to be represented as part of the best work from the school. Apparently, I'm known as the hot guy from Georgia to the girls and boys at Ringling in Sarasota. Just incase you haven't seen the finished product over on my facebook, here it is. Trust me, if there was any magic at all, it came from my cousin, not me. </p><p align="center"><img src="thesis.jpg"></p><p>Friday I just got drunk with Jerm and Padmini and regaled them with my fabulous cable. I promise it will be my last tryst with Everclear. The bottle's empty. The party's over. Just a note, though: I just love Padmini. There's a reason she's on the top row of the Friends Page.</p><p>Anyways, hopefully sleep will help me to forget that I have one more day to deal with. By this time next week, things have to be different. That would be sublime.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Aching</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=33','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Boys Wanna Fight </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
