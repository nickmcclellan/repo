      <div style="clear:both;"></div>Just one thing. Does anyone want to go to Europe with me this summer? I'm not just asking for anyone, like some random person reading this, but seriously, one of my friends who just might happen to read this, do you want to go to Europe?<br /><br />I want to go for a month, and get a railpass, and everything, and go to England, France, and Spain, at the very least. I'd like to go with someone who really wants to do some exploration. Gotta figure this stuff out, so let me know!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/inutreeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'm going to take a break.  Yup, a break.  Of course, we all have a break this week, but as per tradition, the Blog will not appear next week.  My post will appear sometime around Saturday though detailing my adventure for the week, so don't fret.  I plan on doing some good ol' fashioned HTML Bloggin'.  So look forward to that.<p>The paper last night could have been a mediocre success or a complete failure. Suffice it to say, I was very distressed throughout the evening. I kept waking up like it was time to go to school and freaking out thinking I had overslept. I mean, you would think if you had four hours to sleep after laboring hours on a worthless paper, you'd fall right to sleep, but that wasn't the case last night. Nope, I was considerably distressed.</p><p>At this moment, I'm feeling mildly sick. After weeks of resisting the plague of various colds that have claimed many of my friends (Jerm's been sick it seems every week), I have finally succumbed to the beast. It's not that bad, though I decided not to do any working out or running today. I figured I was pretty spent from the paper, and should probably give my body a break. I rewarded its good behavior by buying an overpriced Odwalla Strawberry-Banana smoothie and forcing it down my throat (I thought I'd like it, but it had orange juice in it). I don't understand why it had orange juice in it, though. Shouldn't it be called Strawberry-Banana-<em>Orange</em> smoothie instead? I tried, but I can't help it: I don't like orange juice, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.</p><p>I got my tickets to the April 14th garbage concert today. Row G2. Is that close? It's general admission, but I've never been to the Tabernacle, so I don't know what it means. I know that week I'll be sublimely happy. It's beyond this mental block I have in my mind, when I know things will be very different. I think that concert is going to be the icing on the cake for me.</p><p> This might sound strange, but garbage is like the one thing in my fucked up life that truly belongs to me. It's always been there, through everything, and it's still right here beside me. I don't know why, but listening to garbage sometimes just makes me feel so alive. Our favorite music always does that, I'm sure. God bless it.</p><p>Here's some good news. Jerm and I were walking into Ramsey yesterday, and these students were handing out copies of the spring Informer. Yup, the magazine <em>I've</em> been published in. Don't read the story, though. It blows big time. It makes me want to cry.</p><p>Ok, so this Spring Break, I plan to finish alot of things. Work past that mental block. I'm also writing a poem. Maybe I can finish my first draft, send it off to my old creative writing teacher, and get some feedback. Gotta get my brakes fixed. See my sister.</p><p>Oh, and take a break. I'll just have to start that now.</p><p>And, just in case you need me, you know how to find me, don't pretend like you don't.</p><p> I'll be around. </p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr>  <td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td>  <td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Alone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Incubus - <em>Wish You Were Here </em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/darkkagomeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Would it be better if I wrote more often?  I doubt it.  You probably get enough of my drivel as it is.  The less, the better.<p>I don't feel good tonight. There are several reasons. I felt really good at the beginning of the week, but that good mood has dwindled down to this moment now: writing my second Fink term paper. There's is nothing more miserable. I suppose stressing about it all through Spring Break would be worse, but at least it would give me something to do.</p><p>Why can't writing be like a physical activity? Granted, I am not an athlete, but I think I could work at it. I'd put in long hours, striving to hone my skills. I'd run miles to build my endurance. I'd even do nasty push-ups and crunches every day to be the best writer I can be.</p><p> But no, that's not how it works. Good writing is developed in the back of your head, on a silent Spring afternoon at the library. It happens when you're reading a good book, ignoring whatever distractions surround you, and you suddenly get the spontaneous need to think. You want to think so bad, it just comes out on paper, and all your teachers want to do it shower it with red check marks and give you A's of affection.</p><p>So, no, I'm not a good writer. I'm didn't spend my Thursday afternoon stuffed inside a book. But I will spend my Thursday night scrambling to get by. Anything to make tomorrow, and the next ten days, to go by faster. Maybe no one will notice.</p><p>I don't know what I'm going to do for Spring Break. I've had so much to deal with in the past two months, I really haven't tried to deal with the more unimportant things. I think I'll go see my sister. I'd like to continue to run and work out. I would have liked to go to Sarasota to see my cousin, but instead I think I'll take my car to get its brakes fixed, and maybe ride my bike around Athens. You know, one last time.</p><p> I may also tweak out my Freshman and Sophomore Year Blogs. I've been tinkering with CSS, trying to shape up my layout. So far, I can't figure out how to get my layers to stop humping eachother. It's like a CSS table orgy, it's disgusting.</p><p>Tomorrow, this paper will be done. I'll look at the finished product, amazed and thankful for the work I am about to do.</p><p>Never break the chain.</p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr>  <td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td>  <td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Listless</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Alison Krauss - <em>It Doesn't Matter</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

    <h3 class="post-title">Tearing Her Apart</h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/brandylj.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'm sorry, I thought my good mood had eroded away into the down pour of the evening thunderstorm, but after staring at my Chaucer paper and reading my teacher's comments again, I am just going to have to slap a big ol' Brandy face on this moment.<p>Ah, <a href="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/friends/brandy.html" target="_blank">Brandy</a>. You were there through so much. I remember the night of my graduation when I came home, donning my cap and gown and various honor cords. Sadly, you were blind and deaf, and you just sort of sat there and let me pet you. You probably wonder who was patting at you (I had taken our then kitten Lily up and down your back), but don't worry dear. You live on, young and vibrant, through glorious Brandy faces, and you make the bad days better because you help us remember the good ones. All rise to recognize the Brandy face!</p><p>Anyways, here's what good ol' Lynn Shutters had to say about my paper:</p><table class="emphasize" width="300" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>I thought you did an excellent job with this topic, and I really felt like I learned something from reading your paper. Watch your phrasing in a few places, and avoid really long paragraphs like the one on pgs. 3-5. Other than that, great work, and I look forward to reading more!<br><br>A</td></tr></table><p>I think she really got my attention with the exclamation point. I mean, who exclaims when talking about someone's Chaucer paper? Only someone who has been so moved by the excellentness would ever dare to add a SHIFT to their #1. Oh yah, and she went there. And did you notice the A? I mean, no A-, just flat out A. That's a 95, easy.</p><p>What really scared me is she wrote the words <em>felix culpa</em> on the board before she handed the papers back. <em>Felix culpa</em> basically means &quot;happy fall,&quot; referring to Adam and Eve and how it's unfortunate that they lost paradise, but it's alright because the Son of God will come down to redeem them. Shutters was telling us that though we failed miserably on our papers, we would have the opportunity to learn and grow from the experience (and she was also allowing rewrites). I thought I was done for sure. I knew my Spring Break would include some editing...</p><p>Well, that wasn't the case. I don't know why it happened, I mean, did I really write an A paper? She seems to think so. Maybe after 3 years of upper-English hell, I have finally outmatched the English department. I have finally delivered a death blow to the scourge that is Trivedi. I just hope Shutters showed it to him. You know their in the same department: Medi<em>evil</em> Studies.</p><p>Anyways, I should really stop. This just made me feel good, it's one highlight, hopefully the first of many. I mean, resolution is the name of the game, right?</p><p>I want a Grill milkshake. I never thought Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force could look so appetizing. </p><p>Also, check out my headline in tomorrow's Red &amp; Black:  <strong>'Be Cool' tepid, but not hot</strong>.  That's what my chief copy editor called witty.  You know who's going to be doing layout for the New York Times in the next 10 years?  It's me, bitch</p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr>  <td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td>  <td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Accomplished</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">garbage - <em>Breaking Up The Girl (Acoustic) </em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

I know, I know, it's all fancy and pretty.<br /><br />Also, notice the Blogroll.  If you think you should be added, do let me know.

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/archive.html">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
