	 For the Haters
	 
    </h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/bleedshirlicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I figured I'd chime in, you know, since I had such a promising morning.  I won't get into it, though. You can expect resolution soon, but not today.  Though it isn't much, today you're going to get an entry.  Count yourself lucky.<p>Well, I haven't been up to much lately. I mean, I've been having a more productive week than I had last week. I don't know why, but last Tuesday I just hit a road block or something. Looking for a job is really discouraging sometimes, especially when you don't get much more than a murmur in response to the endless (expensive) stream of resumes you keep sending. I think I pulled myself out of it before the end of the week though. Also, my feet really hurt last week, so I took a break from the 5x a week running deal. Wouldn't want to get injured, right? Worry not, fitness buffs. I'm 4 for 5 this week (that's 4 days in row, with my eyes set on 9 a.m. Friday).</p><p>Last Friday, I did something interesting. Since I really haven't got the opportunity to do something copy editing-related outside of Athens, I took <em>The Informer</em> up on the offer to do some editing. At the very least, it's given me the opportunity to add more experience to my resume. I was alittle nervous at first, but I fit in really well at the office. Keith is really nice, and I really liked her mother alot. She spend most of the day fiddling with PageMaker and Adobe Illustrator. It was so strange, here I am having a conversation with a much older woman about all this website and design stuff when I'd expect she'd be more apt to give me a lecture on table doilies. She was really cool.</p><p>This week has been better for the job search. I have heard back from a few places, had a phone interview, and found a few potential jobs that feel more like  a better fit than the lot I've been trying for. I just can't wait to know what's going to happen. It's so weird not knowing where you'll be in six months. I can't imagine, but I know it will be someplace different, and I can't hardly wait for that. As I was telling John, being in Georgia is just about tantamount to hell for me now. Maybe I'll embellish more on that later, but again, not today.</p><p>I may have mentioned that I had been working on the final incarnation of my website. I haven't done as much this week as I did last week, but I plan to finish the revisions of the Spring '02 and Fall '01 themes by this weekend. Since I never really had a Fall '01 front page, I was thinking it might be fair to preview it in anticipation of the final update. We'll have to see. I'm running out of space on the UGA server, so I am not sure a new front page would fit. I definitely won't be hosting the finished site on the server, but I'll be sure to leave a redirect before I go. I promise.</p><p>I know, when I go on about the &quot;final update,&quot; I must be really boring. It's just I feel like, of all the things I have accomplished in Athens, my website really stands out. I don't know one person who has kept such a dynamic recording of their life. I've heard people say that hosted journal sites are adequate chronicles of their lives, but I just don't buy it. Blogs like that are more frequently social networks for whiners and drama queens. Sifting through that worthless dribble is really something that can be tolerated only once. I feel like my site and Blog are a testament to my growth as a web designer and as a person. I know, I'm being a snob, but I just think it's true. No matter what I do, no matter where I end up, I will always have &quot;Thursday.&quot;</p><p>Just a parting note, but for over a year, I've had a link spy in my AIM profile. I told myself I wouldn't reveal it for at least a year, just so I got a good idea who exactly read my journal. Well, I was surprised to see that someone who supposedly despises me and all my doings is apparently my #1 fan. I'm flattered that she'd have such a perverse interest in me&#8212;an interest that is unfortunately not mutual. I guess it just goes to show, this really isn't a substitute for conversation. It's an <em>excuse</em>.</p><p>Well, that's probably all for this week. Until next time.</p><p><b>P.S.</b>: Marilia's coming back early. She'll be back from Chile on Monday morning! Excitement!!! :-D</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Loose</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=49','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Never Be Free</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 Haikus for Padmini
	 
    </h3>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/redicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Wow, it's been too long. I have been really busy, though, sort of.  Lately, I've been devoting alot of my creative energies toward the website, which is a good thing. Since I finished revisiting all of the old Blogs, I've been remaking the older updates.  Some of them look really fabulous!  My favorite of the bunch would have the be my revision of the Spring 03 update (remember the cloud background?)  The icons just rock.</p><p>Well, I felt like Blogging more last week, but only if I could come up with something creative. Sadly, it never materialized. Thankfully, I was able to whip up something this evening. It's not Shakespeare, but hopefully it will brighten a certain someone's rainy day.</p><p>I don't think I've adequately addressed the fabulousness that is Padmini. Hopefully I will elaborate before the end of all this, but just so you have a little preview, here's how I feel: in haiku.</p><table class="emphasize" width="300" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>Padmini rises<br>"Electrification sucks"<br>she says with passion<br><br>Movies on Friday<br>Jedi, abortions, and Depp<br>Then the Coby skips<br><br>She likes tofu cubes<br>And the Sunday New York Times<br>Don't forget ice cream<br><br>I can't be sexist<br>Don't want to offend my friend<br>But she's fabulous<br><br>You will make it girl<br>You must believe in yourself<br>Realize you rock</td></tr></table><p>Well, hopefully I will see her soon and partake in some of that ice cream. That's one side effect of all the running I've been doing. Every night, I get the most overwhelming cravings for sweets, it's so hard to bear.</p><p>Speaking of running, I think I experienced my first &quot;high&quot; today. I was running down Cedar Shoals, almost home, when my running anthem &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; came on. My running playlist is about 80 some odd songs long, and I burn through about 13 during a run, so it's not often that I hear that song at the climax. I got this adrenaline rush at the bridge, it was really great, a very impressive sprint. Made me kind of dizzy.</p><p>This week, I'm probably going to have a phone interview with one of the jobs I applied for. Wish me luck, I'm feeling really scared. I hate talking on the phone, especially to someone who has the prerogative to give me my first real job&#8212;not to mention my lifeline out of here. Keep your fingers crossed.</p><p>Ok, back to work on this evening's resumes...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Drained</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=48','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>It's All Over But The Crying</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
