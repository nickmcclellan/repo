	 The Things I Do For You

I wasn't going to let myself go on without finishing up my stuff for Marilia. I can be so worthless sometimes. Though, I'll tell you, sitting in front of the computer for an hour cropping pictures and editing HTML gets kind of boring. Trust me.<p>Highlights of the past week and a half include me finishing that silly Chaucer paper. Like all of my papers, I feel I could have done better. I think my argument was kind of simple, I should have been more specific. I should be less of a pussy. Maybe I should have worked on it alittle bit longer than I did, but oh well. One down, <em>only</em> one to go.</p><p>My mother also got me a bed frame. This has revolutionized my room, as I am now without this depressing sunken mattress and box spring in the center of my room. Granted, it still takes up most of the room, but at least now it looks alot classier. I should probably do some laundry today. Then my room will look just about spotless.</p><p>I have been running like a madman lately. In the past two weeks, I have run over 12 miles each week. I do these 4 mile circuits around Athens on Mondays and Wednesday, and then depending on my mood, again on either Friday or Saturday. It's a very difficult circuit, but I've been able to complete it without too much trouble each day. Genevieve would be really proud. The circuit ends right between the intersection at the Hill Hall and Tate parking lots and the intersection at Cedar St. near O-house. It's a really nasty hill, and I sprint up it every time. It's incredibly draining, but I finish it everytime. It's one of the many things I do.</p><p>Though Friday was a bit troubling. I had planned on doing my run and then go to the gym, but I felt so strange after I was done. I felt very itchy, it was extremely odd. Jeremy said it might have been because I was dehydrated. It's possible, I had run the night before nearly 3.5 miles. I guess next week, I'll try not to overdo it.</p><p>As for today, I'm taking a break. Just a light workout this morning, and a lazy afternoon.</p><p>Last night, I went to Caledonia Lounge with Laura. We saw a band called the Slippery People, who do cover songs of the Talking Heads. I didn't know many Talking Heads songs, but the band turned out to be really cool. Laura's friend Adreana was one of the singers, and Missy's infamous &quot;Inside Mary Lyndon&quot; was the lead singer. That was really kind of neat to see. It would have been nice getting liquored up and heading to Krush Girls, but I guess there are more important things to do. I love hanging out with my Laura.</p><p>As for getting liquored up, perhaps I can do that tonight. We'll see what people are doing.</p><p>I'm going to take a nap. Adios.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Spent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=17','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Rob Duncan - <em>The Final Fight (from 'Chosen')</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/lilypissedicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />It's been a while, I know.  I have been busy, what can I say?  Well, without further ado, here is my dedication to Marilia.<p>Yes, last Wednesday, Marilia left for Santiago, Chile for 10 months. On Sunday before she left, we had a send off for her. David, Kyle, and myself took her out to Chili's. I got her a nice cake with a very endearing message: &quot;Good Riddance Marilia!&quot;</p><p>She knows what I mean. In the past year, I have not had a friend that's quite like Marilia. She and I have been through a whole lot together. Between my carlessness last semester and issues she's had with her family, I'd like to think that we have been supporting eachother. She's one of the most caring friends I've ever had.</p><p>I thought it was a bit unnatural. She just sort of came to me out of no where. Who is really good friend with their roommate? I didn't expect Marilia and I to become as close as we did. I didn't expect that she'd teach me a thing or two about being a true friend. Despite all of that, I really value everything Marilia and I have shared over the last two years.</p><p>Yes, there were fights. Fights so awful, I was near tears trying to get through her thick hide sometimes. She's not the easiest person to deal with, and I'll be the first to tell you that. She's got alot of pride, and so do I, so there were alot of days and nights were we just brushed eachother off. I think she helped me come to grips with alot of my stubbornness, and I think I helped her as well. Even after we removed ourselves from the situation that made us have to see eachother on a daily basis, we still kept in touch, and even hung out every now and then.</p><p>Some of the most fun nights I had last year were because of Marilia.  The night the two of us and Paul and Kyle went out was alot of fun.  Marilia has also been there for me during some of the darker times last semester.  She's very sensitive to me, and she's always there to lend an ear when I need one.  I'm really thankful for that.</p><p>I guess, if you could come up with a reason why I think it's so important for me to do all of this, it would be this: I love Marilia. I don't see her as a passing friend, someone you live with for a year and lose touch with. She's incredibly valuable to me. I've really come to see that in the past year.</p><p>It's my opinion that study abroad sucks if it means I can't hang out with my very self-centered friend at any point for the rest of the year. I'm really bitter about that, but I hope she sees this, and knows that she is loved. When she gets back, she'll know that somewhere, someone thinks she's a pretty amazing person.</p><p>And he's really glad he got a chance to sleep with her once before he left ;-)</p><p>And no, that's not a lie.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Very Sad</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=16','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Gioia - <em>From the Inside (Jr. Vasquez Club Remix)</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
