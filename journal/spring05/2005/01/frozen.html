It's a very special down pour, though. It's going to freeze. In a matter of hours, the light icy layer that's coating Athens streets will become too perilous to travel on. Driving conditions in the morning will force businesses to close. People unwilling to risk the slick roads will instead retreat indoors. And the best part is: it's not going to stop. It just keeps on coming.<p>I don't want to do anything tomorrow. I probably wouldn't have done anything anyways, but there would have been that pressure&#8212;that little twitch inside that insists I do something. Fortunate for me, tomorrow will be spent indoors for a very good reason. I can't wait to get drossy in the next hour, curl up in bed, and wake up tomorrow with absolutely nothing on my agenda but avoiding the ice. That just makes me happy.</p><p>Sure, tomorrow is Saturday. It's naturally a day off, but something's different when the entire day is scrapped because of weather. Sure, I know what you're going to say, wouldn't it be better if it was on a Monday? I agree, I think this would be more <em>useful</em> on a Monday, but let's consider what we have here. Saturday is a great day to relax and unwind from the week, but how many people actually do that? How often do you complicate your weekend with the week's unfinished business? I take comfort in the fact that this weekend, there's every reason in the world to do absolutely nothing.</p><p>Well, that's all I have to say about the freezing rain. In other weather related news, I made the bonehead decision of riding my bike home from school today. I mean, I get out of my Chaucer class at 2:15, and the bus doesn't pick me up until close to 3, and that's not alot of down time. For some reason, though, I wanted to get home just alittle faster. I really just cringed at the though of going to the SLC for a matter of minutes when I could spend that time going home. It just happened that today was the coldest day next to Monday, and I didn't even have my earmuffs with me. Oh, yah, and did anyone get a blast of arctic wind while they were on their way home? Oh, that's right. You drove yourself home. Smart cookie.</p><p>Last night, I almost broke down and tried to download one of the new garbage songs. Did anyone realize that garbage was coming out with a new album this year? I started the normal routine today actually. I now visit the garbage message board during my normal round on the Internet for the latest news on album reviews, leaks, and b-side appearances. The first single is called &quot;Why Do You Love Me?&quot;, and I hear the album is alot darker than beautifulgarbage. I really can't wait to hear it, I think garbage just isn't resonating with me these days. beautifulgarbage feels so much like my first year at UGA, and that's so long ago, it's so hard to break into that again. I want a new addiction.</p><p>I really hope I can contain my anticipation. I want to buy the album on April 12th, listen to it from beginning to end&#8212;completely unspoiled&#8212;so I can truly hear the album as a whole. We'll see if that works out.</p><p>Be safe in the storm, and make sure you take some time out to revel in our frozen world. Goodnight.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Devastated</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=5','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Thirteen</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
