      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/darkkagomeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I've been pretty numb lately. I admit that I have Senioritus, and I'm not really giving classes as much emphasis as I probably should be. I mean, it's the third week, I have some things to do, but considering all I've been through, I just know things are going to be alright. I was playing &quot;what if&quot; with my mother this weekend, telling her that if I failed my Women and Chaucer class, I'd still have a degree in Newspapers. She wasn't amused&#8212;but come on! Am I going to fail?? I don't think so.<p>Basically, I've been plugging away at Friends Pages. I'd like to have the revamped section up by Friday. That would be nice. Right now, I have nine pages left to do&#8212;two of which I'm creating. I e-mailed Mary-Kate and told her I wanted a picture of her so I could introduce my website to her glorious presence. She's not around Athens anymore, and I really miss her.</p><p>It always turns out that after I've labored so strenuously on an update, I decide that my website is inadequate :-/ I mean, I really need to practice my CSS, this site is good, granted, I mean, it looks pretty amazing. I've never done anything as amazing as this, but I could do so much more with CSS. I wouldn't have to labor as much, and I might just inch closer and closer to the 21<sup>st</sup> century. I think I may have to buy a book or maybe screw with some of my pages, playing around. Who knows if the final update will be CSS. I might make it exclusively HTML&#8212;just because this website is based on a very simple design. I mean, when I'm out of this place and I purchase my own webspace (like Jerm!), I think I'll set the bar alittle higher. For now, I think I'll just play around with CSS. There's no rush.</p><p>I was thinking about my cousin's page last week. I was thinking, in the interest of building my resume, I can make that page look just phenomenal. It would take alot of work, but it really is alot of fun. I love working with my webpage and such, but working with content that I have less control over is just exhilarating. I mean, it's like I look at her photography, and I'm like, &quot;What kind of a webpage does this make?&quot; If you haven't checked it out, you must see the <a href="http://www.rsad.edu/~ljones1/" target="_blank">Photography of Laura Jones</a>.</p><p>The weight-training hell continues. I was in so much pain this weekend, but it finally subsided by Sunday. I went back today, but who knows if I will be miserable tomorrow. Let's just say, I can't bench press crap. My partner was like, &quot;Take the bar down, and then explode up!&quot; Unfortunately, all my explosions were spent, and he did most of the lifting :-/</p><p>He did say one thing. He said I'm going to be so strong by the end of the semester. I sure hope so, I'm in the mood to do something amazing&#8212;I want to change my life.</p><p>In other news, I'm a vegetarian now. Surprise, surprise.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Hopeless</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=3','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Killers - <em>Smile Like You Mean It</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
