I updated my old school website yesterday announcing my departure from Geocities. It was a nice run, but I like the UGA server so much better. Ever since I got Studio MX 2004, I have been so website capable! I am able to edit a page, upload it, and view it in a matter of seconds, it's pretty amazing. FTP upload ability is dreamy, of course.<p>Blogger is ok, I have owe much thanks to this useful little tool. I really value having autonomy of my Blog's appearance and location. I was surprised that I could still have both w/ Blogger, so I guess that's why it's sticking around. Plus, I don't have to make a whole new webpage every week, all I do is write a post, and Blogger takes care of archiving and all that other messy stuff. Good times.</p><p>I'm updating my Friends Page very slowly. I did <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/tee.html">Tee</a> and <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/quiana.html">Quiana</a> tonight, and I plan to get around to everyone before...well, before sometime, maybe next week? Classes are, well, they are there, I'm not stressing myself about them too much yet. I realize I'm going to have to get my ass in gear eventually, but I'm dealing with alot right now, it's nice now and then to get a weekend of laziness and repression. That would be this weekend, of course.</p><p>This week, I'm going to do my graduation check, and get my completion of minor for Spanish. We do teacher training for ESL this week, so I might go look into volunteering at the CSS office on Tuesdays or Thursdays in addition to the teaching. I'd like to do something for my Spanish, because I would really like that to help with the job search.</p><p>Well...I'll make an announcement on my recent New Year's Resolution in a few days. It's just a little unbelievable (I'll have to tell Diane first).</p><p>Ok, later peoples!!! </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Fractured </td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=2','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Connie Francis - <em>I Will Wait For You</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
