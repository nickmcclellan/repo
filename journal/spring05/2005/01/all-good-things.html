      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/ccbmessicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I feel like I've been hiding lately. I mean, I'm not opposed to such a notion. I feel like hiding. I think I hide someplace new every semester. Last semester, it was in the SLC. Have you ever slept in the chairs in the SLC on the fourth floor? I have. It's actually quite nice. I remember, last year before we got the SOAR award, I had spent the previous night doing a paper, and I was sleeping up there before I went down to accept the award. It's quite comfortable.<p>Well, the big news is that I have decided to convert to vegetarianism. It's not quite as big as it sounds, though. I've always said it was something I saw myself doing one day. I guess it was Genevieve who really turned me onto it&#8212;though a few others gave me a nudge or two. For one, I heard that when you stop eating meat, it's like you <em>feel</em> alot healthier. I'm not sure if that's true or not, but I certainly feel different. Also, I really hate to prepare meat, I have never been very into that. It's so disgusting. Honestly, it really hasn't been that difficult to convert. I've been eating lots of fruits and veggies, and I tend to prepare more meals at home. It's been a really positive thing, so far.</p><p>Also, this week, our heater is on the fritz. I spent Saturday and Sunday night in a very deep freeze. I stacked blanket upon blanket to keep me from waking up with the chills. My roommates were obviously upset, but I was a bit <em>cooler</em> about the whole situation. I called the landlord on Sunday and he was nice enough to get the heat guy out that afternoon. The heater worked for a few hours before going kaput again. At this point, Jennifer was screaming for blood (at about 10 p.m.), but I told her calling the landlord and waking him up wasn't going to do any good. Last night, I figured out how to get the heat to work at least for short intervals. Luckily, it carried on through the night before going out this afternoon. I hope this isn't permanent.</p><p>I want to go the the Canterbury Tales thing tomorrow night at Tate! Does anyone want to go? I mean, if you do, all you have to do is use that nifty comments feature that I changed my whole <em>frickin' </em>Blog to accommodate. I don't mind an anonymous post now and then. I can always delete them of course :-D</p><p>I'll close with another peak at a Friends Page. I'm especially proud of <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/gen.html" target="_blank">Genevieve</a>'s page. So check it out.</p><p>Until next time. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Restless</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
