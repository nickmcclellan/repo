      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/kikyowhiteicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I called Laura yesterday. I really want to do something to her website&#8212;something big, like I mentioned. She seemed into it, and she's actually got her resume to post on it, so as soon as she's done polishing that, I'm going to put it up for her. She's coming to town a week from Saturday to take pictures for her thesis. She didn't want to bother me, with me in school and all, so she didn't mention it to me. I told her I would like to be a part of the thesis if she still wanted me. So, I get to be in her thesis! I'm going to be a part of art.<p>I suppose it's not as easy as that. She just wants me to come into town that day to take some pictures. I'm sure it will be grueling. She photographed me and my sister during the Winter break for some photos she wanted to send to my mother as a Christmas present. It took alot longer than I thought it would, but it was a very interesting experience to see my cousin doing what she does best. She's very talented, and I look forward to seeing the pictures. She told me she was working on them last night.</p><p>I have to hold an object in my hands&#8212;something that represents me and my personality. She asked if I had a journal of some kind that I wrote in, and as a matter of fact, I do. It's not the same journal from years ago, it's new. I told her it wasn't a crappy piece from Wal-Mart, that it had a personality that would really suit her project. It's nice, I got it from Urban Outfitters. I wish they had one of those places here. I mean, they're expensive, but they have some real quality stuff. Stuff with personality.</p><p>I plan on finishing the revamped Friends Page by Sunday. I'm going to do some photography myself with Marilia on Sunday. And on Saturday, I'm going to see Dina and get a copy of a photo that belongs on my website. I'm also waiting for some photos from Dille, who's taking her sweet time, but I'm not going to rush her! I may just have to start hacking into a certain facebook or Friendster to see if I can scrounge up some photos of her. Also, Vicki, Missy, Rachel, and Melissa are to be done, but I'm sure I have enough for them already. Just need to get around to it...</p><p>Off to class.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Resistant</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=4','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Daniel Bedingfield - <em>If You're Not the One </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
