It's funny, for someone that's so forward looking and resigned to his fate living in worlds far from this one, you'd think I could let the past go.<p>Reading old Blogs is alittle odd. In this particular entry (circa <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/fall02/journal3.html">Fall 2002</a>) I was going on about how happy I was. How I had never been that happy in my whole life. Though I discounted it by admitting I was not completely happy (&quot;all-around&quot; happy as I put it), was I really being serious? How could I possibly fathom what happiness really was? So I partook in some innocent flirting and just happened not to roll snake eyes&#8212;so I spent and evening spooning some guy. Was I happy? Or was I just being really stupid...</p><p>I had a most bizarre run in today. I took a nap before going to dinner with Leena. I woke up, went to pee, and once I opened to door to the bathroom to go about finding my wallet and other various things I needed before I left, I was <em>attacked by a dog</em>. Yes, there was a strange dog in my room, across from the bathroom, who turned around as soon as I opened the door and began to bark incessantly at me and lunge and jump in my direction. I screamed out, &quot;Oh my God!&quot; shut the door, and shook with shock and fear.</p><p>After a few seconds, my reason began to come back. Obviously, I had not shut the front door properly and some neighborhood dog had decided to wait out the thunderstorm by gallivanting around my house. I opened the door while said dog kept barking really loud so I told him to shut up. I gave him some water and tried to share some of my banana with him (but he apparently was not a health nut). Once I found my wallet and other necessary things (all the while getting much vocal input from the dog), I took it outside, got in my car, and drove away. It was a very strange encounter.</p><p>I think I'm leaving next Friday. Wow, one week. I almost can't believe it. I really am still waiting to hear from this job I could get in New Hampshire, but apparently they are taking their time deciding on who they want to be their new copy editor. I keep e-mailing the guy and he keeps telling me I'm still a finalist and he's not yet made his decision. I have chosen to assume I haven't gotten the job just because it makes moving easier. I loathe waiting. I just don't have time anymore.</p><p>Oh, and I have decided to dump my screenname. If you want to know my new one, you're just going to have to ask me. Just to let you know, though, I plan on not being online very often in the future. If you're lucky, you're already on my buddy list. If not, well, sucks for you.</p><p>I'll see you later.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Shook</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=55','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Disintegration</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
