And here's one last Blog recounting the events.<p>Missy came up this weekend, to my surprise. I didn't have any exciting plans, though, which is as per usual. Marilia agreed to partake in some Bacardi with me on Friday and I tried to invite some people over my place. It seems that everyone was busy. You know, too busy sleeping or being anti-social or whatever. Bastards.</p><p>It was around that time that Missy gave me a call and told me she wanted to come downtown with her. I wasn't that enthused about it, but it seemed better than sitting at home. Since Marilia and I were plastered at that point, I begged Missy to come get me which she sadly refused. I just sat in my room downloading songs from <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em> resigned to the fact that I would not be going out. But, low and behold, Missy called me back and said she'd come get me. She earned uber brownie points for that :-D</p><p>So we went downtown and I brought the bottle of Bacardi along. Missy had this ingenious plan of taking it with us and mixing our own drinks from cheap Diet Cokes from the bar. However, none of us had a jacket to hide it in. To my dismay, Missy took one look at the loose jeans around my waist and said, &quot;Just put it in your pants!&quot; So Missy shoves the bottle of Bacardi down my backside and I walk around the whole night with it virtually in my ass. It was not comfortable, believe me.</p><p>We went to All Good, the bar that used to be Gator Haters. I was really impressed with it! It had a very nice downstairs and upstairs, and there was even a back porch on the roof. The Bacardi idea worked really well especially since the bartender had no problem giving Missy free Diet Cokes. I had fun talking to people and seeing people I didn't expect to see. Sigh...</p><p>On Saturday, I went to the Campus Lodge pool with Missy and Claire to lay out and swim. We had a nice time, and Missy wanted to go downtown again. I had some dinner at Stevi B's with Gen and I headed home to get ready. Missy came by to get ready and, oddly enough, she complimented my shower. I don't know why, but that made me feel good. I don't really like my shower.</p><p>After some drama involving a hair dryer, we headed downtown with Marilia and went to Cutter's and All Good again. It wasn't as fun as the night before, and Missy disappeared with some guy, but I had a good time with Marilia. We went to the Grill afterward. I spilt my milkshake and dropped a pepper shaker. I felt really bad about that :'( We went home and it was really strange, my roommate came back at the same time. She moved all of her stuff out last week, it was really strange seeing her.</p><p>It wasn't a good day for her today, though. She was moving out one of her larger furniture pieces &#8212;the television unit&#8212;and she dropped the corner onto her foot and ripped off her big toe nail. It sounded excruciating, she does not handle pain very well, and she had to go to the hospital. Her parents seemed really nice, though. I wish I could have met them under different circumstances.</p><p>Anyways, so that was my weekend. I even added a new secret entry to my Blog. This is much more upbeat, so that's good. I'm such a dork sometimes.</p><p>And I said goodbye to Missy today. I don't know when I'll see her again, but I look forward to whenever that is. She was the one of the most important people I met at UGA and I'm really going to miss her.</p><p>This will be a big Blog week, I promise. On Sunday, you can expect the final update. I will also post my Senior Year Blog before the end of the week. Also, the poem I've been writing will make its debut. Also, I have been anxiously awaiting the writing of my last Blog entry. Can you believe it? I will probably Blog alot this week anyways since its the last week.</p><p>Oh, and apologies for the recent mainstream mp3's in my radio.blog. I guess I'm just partial to cute boy rock bands as of late.</p><blockquote><em>Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity<br>And I've been locked inside that house<br>All the while you hold the key<br>And I've been dying to get out<br>And that might be the death of me<br>And even though there's no way in knowing where to go<br>Promise I'm going because I gotta get outta here...</em></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Hungry</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=57','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Relient K - <em>Be My Escape</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
