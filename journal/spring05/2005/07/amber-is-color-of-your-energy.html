There hasn't been one person who has been there for me more than my friend Genevieve.</p><p>We've been through alot together. Ever since I started my strange kick of running last Spring, no one has been there more than Genevieve to help get me past the fifth mile (well, maybe the second mile, but her leg hurt). She's always been there to give me a boost, whether it was moments when I feel like I'm losing my mind or even when I needed someone to help drive my car up to Ohio, she's always been getting me there.</p><p>This semester, Gen even leant me her bike to ride since I was worried that my K-mart P.O.S.'s wheel was about to fall off. I couldn't have done all that I did without her help. She was there for me when I had a very startling breakdown last January. She was the first person I called. God, she's even going to be there for me tomorrow, driving behind me as I take my things to Ohio and away from here. I don't think I've had a friend who has ever been so selfless.</p><p>I've given her things too, though. Mostly tofu, milkshakes, and aggrivation, though. We've had alot of fun this last semester, tofu burritos aside. One night, there was some late night swimming at her new apartment. Maybe I should have talked less about dietary stuff, though, but I like to look fondly on moments like that between us. Not alot of people try to get Gen, but I do. She's always been my best friend and she always will be.</p><p>That's what sucks about leaving. I really want to, you have no idea, but not because of Genevieve. God, I would stay just to be with someone like her. If I could take the good things with me, she would be at the top of my list (which is probably why she's coming along for the ride).</p><p>Just so you know, this is not the end for us. I forsee the two of us on some beach in Florida, steps from our back porch, walking with Kali thinking about days like this. Yup, together again, you will see.</p><p>So yah, I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss watching movies with beautiful women with her. I'm going to miss trips to Barberitos. And yes, I'm going to miss that terrible dog too.</p><p>It's a good thing I'm taking her with me. I've got a nice spot saved in my room where I can keep her ;-)</p><p>So I will never let her go. I never want to...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Burritoish</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=61','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">311 - <em>Amber</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
