      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/rainbowinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />After a muted sigh in my upstairs hallway, I say to myself, &quot;This is it.&quot; I take one last jog down the stairs. Everything's packed. I've left nothing behind (except for a few lucky dust bunnies). Tonight, I leave my precious home behind.<p>I have to leave a tribute for this place. I've lived her for the past 2 years, for better or for worse, and it has become my one true home. While most of you have homes away from home, family members with whom you can stay with, I don't. Well, I do, but very far from here. Highland Park has been a comfort for me and a haven. I am thankful to have had such a wonderful time here.</p><p>When I think of my house, I remember the day I moved in. It was a crazy day. My sister had ditched me the night before, saying she would not help me move stuff with her car. Because of this, I had to borrow my aunt's van and make 2 trips to Athens myself. On the first trip, with the box spring of my bed strapped dangerously loose to the roof of the van, I listened to the radio with hopes of some musical goodness. To my delight, something truly special happened.</p><p>I should preface this. There are moments in my life when I am happy or sad, and sometimes these moments can be enriched by the presence of a song. In this moment, I was sublimely excited and anxious to finish moving things. It was at this very time, on the 99X RetroPlex, they played The Cure's &quot;Pictures of You,&quot; which I had grown very fond of over the summer. I don't think I ever belted out a song with such vigor in my whole life, it was a true joy. That was the beginning of my experience at Highland Park Dr.</p><p>My house became the antithesis of what dorm life was for me. I lived with people I knew and loved (or put up with, in the case of Milo). Also, my house played a significant role in my relationship with Matt, as he was unwilling to have me at his place and my space was alot bigger. When the two of us lost our cars, it also became often our only place to go. In these days, I think I enjoyed the house the most. It was boring, but it was a place I loved being with him. It was good then.</p><p>There were of course the parties. All two of them, both ending up with visits from the cops. Granted, I argued the one ticket down in court, but I could not risk having that many people over again. Oh, but they were good parties. Keg stands, body shots, and who can forget the orgy in Milo's room? I know I can't.</p><p>This year, though, things were different. I had 2 new roommates who were nothing like Marilia. Don't get me wrong, I think David was my favorite roommate ever. He was responsible, clean, and a good friend. I wish Marilia had stuck around, the three of us would have had an amazing time. Anyways, the place just got colder. Jennifer, my other new roommate, was always very standoffish, and the three of us never found a way to make it fun like the previous year.</p><p>And things got depressing. I began to see my house more and more as a prison than a haven. It was almost haunted with memories of the past&#8212;memories I wish I could push away. As my time at Highland Park dwindled, I became anxious for what was next.</p><p>Now that I'm leaving&#8212;now that the walls are painted, the floor is vacuumed, and my posters are off the wall&#8212;I feel sad. I see myself, in a year maybe, driving up to this place and remembering the good times and bad times with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. It was my space, away from everything. It wasn't glamorous or even great location-wise, but it was mine.</p><p>And God, I will miss it.</p><p align="center"><img src="highland.jpg" width="350" height="261"></p><p>So, to my Athens home (pictured above during the big ice storm this past January), I say thank-you. I hope your next tenants love you as much as I did.</p><p>Oh, and sorry we fucked up the linoleum :-(</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Home</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=60','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Pictures of You</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
