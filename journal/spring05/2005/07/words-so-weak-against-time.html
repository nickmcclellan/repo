      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/inutreeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I have returned. I needed a break. I was kind of waiting around for something that hasn't come&#8212;something that's may still come, thankfully. I've already replaced the pronouns with something more substantial, so that's the good news.  The bad news is, unless you noticed during the one minute today I accidentally published it, the entry remains hidden. I'm so mysterious. I don't have many hidden entries. Just that one (and the other one). When I'm done, I'll be sure to leave the door unlocked.<p>I only have two weeks left. I would like to be out of here by this weekend, but that's probably not likely. Being realistic, I'd have to say that I probably won't leave until late next week. As for where I'm going, I am embarrassed to admit I still don't know. I'm thinking Ohio is still the likely candidate. I'm planning on that contingent, and up until this weekend, it was the most dismal prospect before me. Jerm called yesterday and we had a nice conversation. I think he'd certainly like me being in Dayton, and it's nice to know I'd have a friend there too. It just made me feel good, that's all. I always figured I'd have a job, but it's not a total loss if I missed out on that. Just a disappointment.</p><p>Well, before I disappeared this weekend, I had an eventful Friday night. It was <em>really</em> my last Krush Girls, I swear. I went with Leena and Marilia and I had a blast. I remembered all of it too! I should say that things got fuzzy at the end, but not nearly as bad as my tryst in June. Sigh, not much to write home about. Shirtless dancing. Long Island Iced Teas. Some guy complimented my muffin shirt. I think that was probably the best part of the night, I always wear the coolest shirts. Oh, I must not forget the pillowy lips. I couldn't resist :-*</p><p>This week I will be packing everything away. I will be finishing some website stuff too. I think this will be the week I finish my Friends Pages. I really need to see Tiffany anyways, it's been too long.</p><p>I did do something today. I got myself a radio blog since I had all the webspace and nothing to do with it. I converted my Spring '05 music into a nifty radio.blog soundtrack of my last semester at UGA. It's pretty neat, I have a very eclectic blend of music. It should make sifting through all those archives looking for hidden entries much more interesting. Be sure to check it out, it's pretty cool.</p><p>Tomorrow, I'm going to run. I'm going to clean up the house. I will have to find some boxes...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Deadened</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=54','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Ayumi Hamasaki - <em>No More Words</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
