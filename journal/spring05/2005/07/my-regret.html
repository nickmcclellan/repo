      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/kagomeregreticon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I have been promising this for months. I had planned on finishing it early this May, but my efforts to get someone to read the poem and comment on it went unacknowledged and unanswered. I'm sorry, I know that I am not the best poet in the world, but I try. Damnit, I went all the way up to Advanced Creative Writing and got an A, so I can't be that bad.<p>This is the last poem I am putting on my website.</p><p>The poem is called &quot;My Regret,&quot; and it is a continuation of the poem &quot;My Will,&quot; which I finished last year in May. I have been working on this poem since early February and in this time, it has truly become a living, breathing thing for me. The value I assign to this poem will probably only be wholly understood by me, but let me just say that finishing it is a great achievement for me. I am so happy to have to opportunity to share it with anyone who is interested in reading it.</p><p>Just so you know how it has come about, it all started one afternoon on the Athens bus. I knew I wanted to continue &quot;My Will,&quot; but I was uncertain what images I could use. All that came up into me were accusations and answers to questions I never heard asked: &quot;You think I'm crazy,&quot; I remember, were the first words that spawned the poem. As you can imagine, the poem surged in so many different directions from there.</p><p>As I mentioned, the poem is a continuation of &quot;My Will,&quot; which was inspired partly by the anime <em>Inuyasha</em>. In it, there is a love triangle between Inuyasha, a dead priestess Kikyo, and her reincarnation, a young girl named Kagome. You see, Inuyasha and Kikyo are lovers who are duped by a duplicitous demon into believing that they have betrayed eachother. In the ensuing duel, Kikyo losses her life, but is later resurrected. Her only hold on the living world is the intense hatred she felt for Inuyasha before her death&#8212;a hatred she is incapable of letting go of.</p><p>In the poem &quot;My Will,&quot; Inuyasha recounts his relationship with Kikyo and his frustrations over why she would ever think that he would have betrayed her. He is wounded in their fight, but recovers (as is revealed in &quot;My Regret,&quot; by the care of Kagome). He is shocked to find, years after her death, she has returned to him. She wants to be with Inuyasha. She wants to take him with her back to hell.</p><p>In the final line of the poem, as it seems obvious that Inuyasha should just let Kikyo die, he says to the absent figure, Kagome, &quot;Forgive my will, Kagome / You never had me,&quot; revealing that his love for Kikyo is indeed important enough for him to die for. In my poem &quot;My Regret,&quot; I explore Kagome's response to Inuyasha's choice.</p><p>If you know anything about me, you should know this poem has less to do with Inuyasha and more to do with the issues I have been dealing with in the past six months. You can see alot of that in this poem, and though I use the story as a source of inspiration and imagery, the act could have very well have happened to me&#8212;or anyone. The story is just a tool I manipulate to communicate my emotion, if that makes any sense.</p><p>Writing this poem was very important to me. I wanted to make something beautiful and enduring out of the misery and pain I felt after&#8212;well, after Matt left. It's not something unique to me, as many of my other poems have been. I imagine anyone who has had to experience someone they love leave them and not understand why will probably recognize the emotions of this poem.</p><p>Now that I have finished it, I am grateful that I took my time. &quot;Separation&quot; evolved under similar circumstances to this one, but so much more quickly. It was inspired by a  difficult &quot;situation,&quot; and though I still feel the poem has power and value, it is sloppy, unfocused, and almost entirely unrecognizable to anyone but me. &quot;My Regret,&quot; on the other hand, has changed from a string of personal questions and flashes of images into a woman's fevered hallucination aboard a crowded subway train. It's good, I don't need anyone to tell me it's good, I know it's good.</p><p>So, enough of this. I wrote it for Matt, just like I wrote &quot;My Will&quot; for Matt, because I feel emotion is not something you should keep inside. It is not something you let out in silently in dark corners. In this instance, the strong emotion I felt has become an enduring, beautiful thing that will live on and hopefully affect the lives of others. I hope that, if he does read it, he understands.</p><blockquote><i>This was your will<br>your fevered glance<br><br>And this is my regret.</i></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Translucent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=11','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Regret</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
