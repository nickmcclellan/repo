      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/treeinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Genevieve called alittle bit ago.  She gave me crap about not drinking plenty of water.  It's not that I didn't want to drink water, it's just so annoying having to refill that gallon with purified water from the faucet every damn time I finish it.  That's one thing I want my new place to have.  I want a water purifying built into my fridge.  Then I'll be swimming with the fishes.<p>I think it's apporpriate that I'm running in the Peachtree tomorrow. What, I didn't tell you? Well, I didn't know myself until Friday. David got a number, but he doesn't want to run. He hasn't been training, and for no real practical reason, I have. I bought it off of him and am now scurrying about my pre-race preparations. Drinking lots of water. Washing my shorts. Boasting on the Blog. You know, the normal stuff.</p><p>I've had an interesting weekend. It wasn't really good or really bad, it just happened. Friday, Missy invited me to her friend Joe Brown's party. It sounded interesting enough, and I didn't feel particularly anti-social, so I went. Missy was as would be expected&#8212;drunk, spacey, and probably telling me more than I needed to know. I think I've gotten over repeating things like that, though. It's gotten me and my friends into a heap of trouble lately. I saw quite a few old friends and it was very pleasant. Although the hunch punch lacked that special kick,  it was nonetheless adequate.</p><p>I woke up at 8 the next morning to head to Ikea with Marilia to meet up with Kyle and Paul. My objective was to survey the furnishings, and I think I've come back with some good ideas. I want something traditional, maybe with some leather couches, but dark cherry wood tables. Maybe lighter toned wood for the kitchen. I finally found some bedsheets I could live with, so I picked them up. I was scoffed by my friends for picking things they considered to be plain, but I have to admit, I really love what I got. The black and grey bedsheet that I picked up is especially nice and thouroughly comfortable.</p><p>After Ikea, we had lunch at Joe's. That's Joe's on Juniper, mind you. I've never been, actually. I don't spend alot of time in Midtown, but being there is not a pleasant experience for me. I think maybe that's why I didn't go to Pride. A wave of anxiety just washes over me. I wish I wasn't such a wimp about such things. I wish there was something I could do to make being here less unpleasant. I wish someone would do something to make me feel  less hated. Moment like yesterday just make it more clear to me that I need to get out. I don't belong in this place. Not anymore. </p><p>Though, the one thing that does make me feel moderately better is running, and I'll be doing alot of that tomorrow. I've never run a 10K, but I know it is within my abilities. I did a more accurate survey of my usual route. It's about 5.8 miles&#8212;not exactly 6, but close enough. 10K is just over 6, so I should be able to pull through. I know I'll probably not dazzle my peers, but I think I will make it all the way without stopping. I always feel so good after a race. This one ends in Midtown. I hope that doesn't sour the moment for me.</p><p>I've been working more on that poem I made a murmur about a couple months ago. It's been in progress for about 6 months now. It's really special to me, and I don't want it to be flawed. I'm combing over it meticulously and making sure it is perfect. I will probably tweak it out shortly before the Senior Year Blog. Wow, in less than a month, this will be over. Exciting.</p><p>I had better go, though. Must hydrate.</p><blockquote><em>Run, my baby, run my baby, run<br>Run from the noise of the street and the loaded gun<br>Too late for solutions to solve in the setting sun<br>So run my baby, run my baby, run!</em></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Tonto</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=51','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Lauryn Hill - <em>I Gotta Find Peace of Mind </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
