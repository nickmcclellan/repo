      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/runbabyrun.jpg" width="100" align="left" />For my last week of Blogging, I'm sending out a few tributes. There is a small handful of people that have made my last semester in Athens worthwhile. The first little tribute went out to my good friend  Jeremy. I got Marilia down when she left for Chile. Missy got hers this week. This one belongs to Leena.<p>Last night, I got a call from Leena. She wanted to go downtown, one last time before we went out separate ways. It's funny, I was looking forward to sitting at home and watching <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em> for the third time, but somehow that all melted away when I heard she was going out. If it was anyone else, I would have just told them, &quot;Some other time,&quot; but for Leena, I'd go. That girl is worth it.</p><p>I was passed out for most the late afternoon because I had been moving furniture all day. Let me just say I'm very happy to be rid of my washer and dryer. God, those things were heavy. When I woke up and talked to Leena, I jumped in the shower and hurried my little butt to her apartment so we could get going.</p><p>The finer details of the evening are not important. We went to a few bars, had alot to drink, and shared some thoughts. We came to the decision that we couldn't refuse compliments given to eachother. She thinks I'm hot and I won't correct her. I think she's just fucking amazing, and she can't argue with me about it.</p><p>I don't know if there's anything more I can say than this: I haven't been happy this year. It's hard to find the motivation to be the patient and adventurous person I used to be. I told Leena last night that, more than anyone else, spending time with her (whether it be at the front of the stage at a Krush Girls show or it be a cool spring afternoon lunch at the Grit) has made me the happiest I have been this year. When I'm with her, I forget my stupid problems and just have about as much fun as possible.</p><p>It's sad to say, but I would have never expected to be so close to Leena. We drifted away for a few years but came back together. I'm really going to miss her alot, but I'm sure she'll learn lots cutting up cadavers.</p><p>Hey, that's one way I can get into MCG...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Girl Scout Cookie Shooters </td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=58','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Kelly Clarkson - <em>Since U Been Gone</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
