      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/kikyowhiteicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Tonight, I saw <em>Showgirls</em> again&#8212;this time with commentary!  I actually watched it a few weeks ago w/ Jerm, Adam, and the Pad (been a while since I called her that).  I don't think I mentioned this, but that movie is amazing.  It is immaculate.  It cannot be put into words.  As David Schmader, our glorious commentator put it, &quot;Showgirls triumphs in that every single person involved in making the film is making the worst possible decision at every possible time. It is this incredible density of failure that makes <em>Showgirls</em> sublime.&quot;  If you haven't seen this movie, your life is incomplete.  And I mean that.</p><p>I also did the running today. That turned out well. I've been feeling really burnt though. I guess it's all the running and biking I did this last week. Genevieve said she thought I had a tan. That's pretty cool. Despite the upcoming garbage week, I still intend to run my little heart out, so maybe my color change will continue. I don't think I've enjoyed Spring this much (you know, with all the outside physical activity) since...well, ever.</p><p>I talked to April today. Oh, not sexy brave Niger April. She's where the telephones can't reach her, sadly. I'm talking about <em>the</em> April. April Smith. Long-lost high school best friend April. Her reason for calling me was to get my address to send me her graduation announcement, but I know it's really because she misses her Nick in her life. We talked forever about a whole lot of stuff. I even scored an invite for Wednesday night to watch anime and even sleep in her bed! I'm looking forward to it. It's just not the same without her.</p><p>This weekend I finished my Junior Year Blogs. I haven't written the whole retrospective thing yet. That takes some time and excessive hyperlinking. I just want to say that my Spring 04 Blog was just about the best layout ever for the site. I mean, this whole &quot;flower power&quot; Blogger-induced fantasty is great, but the whole gray, black, and white thing w/ icons is when I really began to shine as a Blogger. I can promise you my modernization of the layout makes it look 10 times more amazing than it did last year. I guess you'll just have to enjoy all that after I decide to upload. I'll give you a heads up, at least. Maybe after garbage week.</p><p>And with that, let the games begin. Nothing personal. Nothing transparent. Only garbage&#8212;nothing else. I may impart some personal stuff regarding myself and my experience with garbage, but don't anticipate current events. I know, I know, I'm lame, but I can use my soapbox for anything I want, so there.</p><p>I promise. It won't suck. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Longing</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=26','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Biff Naked - <em>Lucky</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
