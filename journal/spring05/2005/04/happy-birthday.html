      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/darkkagomeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />This entry will not see the light of day for most likely several months (or at least a few). By the time anyone sees this, I will hopefully be long gone. Despite my desire to keep you out of my business, I just thought, for hindsight purposes, this would be an accurate portrayal of the absolute hell I have had to endure this year.<p>I haven't written once about Matt this semester. Don't assume that that means I haven't thought about him. Oh no, I've thought about him often. So often, it's sickening. What do you expect? Just because someone decides to leave you behind and cut you out of their life doesn't mean that you forget about them. It doesn't mean I stop loving him. I can't ever do that. I wish it was as easy for me as it is for him, but I can't walk away from my feelings&#8212;I can't leave him behind.</p><p>Today is his 21st birthday. I was there for his 19th birthday, you know. It was at Daniel Tindol's apartment. I was in charge of alcohol. I strolled my good drinking-age friend John to the liquor store and got a nice handle or two of Everclear for the kiddies to share. We had such delicious hunch punch that night. Did you know that I was falling for him then? I was so into him then. Not even a week later did we start dating. The point is, I was there.</p><p>On his 20th birthday, Matt had been having a rough year. He didn't have his car because he had his license taken away for 6 months. He thought his birthday would come and go and no one would make much fuss. I was determined to show him that people cared about him and wanted to celebrate his special day. I e-mailed Evan and I called Diane and Sarah. We got a group of his friends together for dinner at Chili's. It was a surprise. It nearly worked, too. His friend Megan blew it and told him about the surprise, and Matt saw Kyle's SUV out in the parking lot, but again: I was there. I was a part of a very special day, and it made me happy to be a part of what made him happy.</p><p>Today is his 21st birthday. I'm not there. No, I'm the one person who <em>can't</em> be there. I'm the one person, that for some reason, doesn't get to celebrate this day. On Wednesday, I was sitting with Diane, about to go to the ESOL testing, and I asked her if she was up to tofu party on Saturday (since I had to postpone it last week). She said she couldn't, she was going to Atlanta. I didn't press her. After I made her dinner, I asked her, as per casual conversation, what she was going to Atlanta for.</p><p>&quot;It's Matt's birthday,&quot; is what she said. No offense Diane, but I didn't forgot it was Matt's birthday. I could never forget Matt, just so you know.</p><p>What could I say? I can't say anything to her about it. He won't talk to me. He left me, he refuses to answer my e-mails (granted I only sent two, but still too much). I just have to accept that I am hated. I am repressed and forgotten, and by the time anyone realizes that that is cruel and wrong, it won't matter anymore. I will be gone.</p><p>So when Diane said that to me&#8212;this being the first glimmer of Matt's existence that I've received in a very long time&#8212;I just said, &quot;Oh, that's cool,&quot; trying so hard to obfuscate the obvious wincing pain she had unknowingly inflicted upon me. I had to fake a smile, fake a whole conversation about some brain dead television show just so she wouldn't know that I was hurt. I wish I could be there, with him. If not as someone who is loved by him, as someone who loves him, like I know all of his friends do. But, like I said, I can't. I am hated. I am to blame. </p><p>I found this DVD set I would have loved to give him. I bookmarked it, even considered for a split second today about giving it to Diane to give to Matt. But no. I would be seen as some sort of psycho if I did that. I just have to sit here alone at night staring at myself in the mirror wondering why being in love with someone hurts so bad. And I have to feel hated. Because I am wrong. I am disgusting filth, and obviously deserve this. </p><p>So no. I didn't forget. I never forget. I will never stop loving Matt.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Very Sad</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=36','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Turn</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
