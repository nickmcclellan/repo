      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/bleedlikemeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I must say, this is pretty cool.  I've never been in a position to write a garbage review.  I must admit, I am a lousy garbage critic, because I love this band.  There's practically nothing that I don't have tremendous patience and understanding for when it comes to garbage. If they want to dump the technobabble and make a straight guitar album, I think I can take that.  I will admit, though, I had my reservations.<p>I already expounded my thoughts on &quot;<a href="2005/02/why-do-you-love-me.html">Why Do You Love Me.</a>&quot; It's a fun song, and now that I've had a few weeks to listen to it over and over again, I think it truly is a return more to the &quot;Push It&quot; type single garbage released with <em>Garbage</em> and <em>Version 2.0</em>: high energy and thrilling. It's just fun, and light on the &quot;darkness,&quot; per se.</p><p>The album as a whole, at least now, seems to conform to a style alot more readily than the previous 3. With <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, it always seemed like a few songs  echoed the albums that came before it. For example, &quot;Silence is Golden,&quot; at the time, sounded very much like <em>Garbage</em> (which is funny, because now it sounds almost proto-<em>Bleed Like Me</em>; almost like garbage's sound has come full circle).</p><p>There are very few songs on the album that call back to the past. &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; has a bit of <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> in it. &quot;It's All Over But The Crying&quot; is probably a distant cousin of <em>Version 2.0</em>. All the others, though patently garbage, ascribe to this new fourth sound that can only be called <em>Bleed Like Me</em>. Mad props for that, guys.</p><p>The downside to that, though, is what stands out with this new sound? Drums and guitar sound an awful lot like any other mediocre rock album out there, right? That's difficult to answer. I think just because garbage has chosen to ascribe itself to an easily distinguishable genre as opposed to the mixed bag we're all used to sticking them in doesn't mean they've given up on being the garbage we all know and love. After all, they're all over those drums and guitars when they play live, and we don't snicker then, do we? I guess I'm saying that the best way to see this album is to look at the forest for the trees.</p><p>Butch Vig says that starting this album with &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; is a &quot;milestone&quot; in the career of garbage. I think it's a solid song&#8212;much more so than <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>'s &quot;Shut Your Mouth.&quot; I expected something faster, but I'm satisfied with what we've got here. I don't notice the drums as much as they made me think I would. There is that part toward the end where Dave Grohl tears it up, but I would say it's not as impressive as Vig on &quot;Parade.&quot;</p><p>The likely second single &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; is possibly the strongest lyrically that garbage has ever produced. It's fresh and really serves to capture the mood of the album as a whole. It seems to suggest, as it's the first album to be named to after a track, that the band is really running on all four cylinders creatively. The sound is more succinct. The category more defined. The experiment is (perhaps sadly) over.</p><p><em>Rolling Stone</em> says the album loses steam toward the last third. I must admit I felt things slowing down more toward the middle, but on second listen, I think I may come to appreciate &quot;Metal Heart&quot; and &quot;It's All Over But The Crying.&quot; I guess the problem alot of traditional garbage fans may have with these songs is the lack of distinguishing characteristics between each song. For example, the difference between &quot;Silence is Golden&quot; and &quot;Cherry Lips&quot; on <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> is like night and day. But again, maybe the differences on <em>Bleed Like Me</em> are more subtle. This is something I'll have to ponder.</p><p>I thought &quot;Why Don't You Come Over&quot; would be my favorite, but it was alright. Good intro to &quot;Happy Home,&quot; which again displays the lyrical maturity of songs like &quot;Bleed Like Me.&quot; It's haunting and atmospheric like &quot;So Like a Rose,&quot; but also remarkably fresh. I can understand the whole reflection on just how difficult the album was to make and this song representing the strength the band found to pull it together. Nicely done.</p><p>Now to brass tacks. &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; is by far my favorite track on the album. It's got the slimmed down sound, but it's still got a hint of that traditional garbage sound. I mean, after taking one look at the album credits and browsing the band's various roles, you have to wonder why Steve's still doing &quot;noises&quot; and &quot;programming&quot; and Duke's still into &quot;atmospherics.&quot; Tracks like &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; remind us that the same garbage we all know and love is still there, you just have to know where to look.</p><p>All and all, I must say I enjoyed sitting on the 4th floor of the SLC around 9:15 this morning listening to <em>Bleed Like Me</em> from beginning to end on my dying iPod. Saving myself for it was the right thing to do (though I regret reading along with the lyrics; it really should have been a raw listen). I think that this is exactly the album we've been waiting for. It's different enough to perplex and confound us. It's memorable and progressive. It might not change the world, but it's a whole new chapter for garbage fans everywhere.</p><p>But, come on! If you're disappointed, hopefully there's some strange b-side coming down the pipe. At least you have that to look forward to, right?</p><p>Ok, expect my account of the garbage concert this Thursday to appear sometime Friday (with pictures, I hope). Hopefully I'll see you at the show!</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Almost Free</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=30','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Run Baby Run</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
