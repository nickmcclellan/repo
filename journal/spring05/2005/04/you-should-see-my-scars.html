      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/garbageweekicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Well, nearly 24 hours after I entered the Tabernacle, my ears are still buzzing. The show was awesome! It was so awesome seeing garbage play live! They put on a great show, and Shirley was absolutely stunning.  She's just so beautiful, there's no doubt about that.<p>I went along with my sister and we ate at Lee's Golden Buddha before heading down to the Tabernacle. She had an amaretto sour and I had some Merlot and Pino Gregio, which got us all buzzed for the show. I was really anxious about getting a good spot, but thankfully, there are plenty of them at the Tabernacle, so Jen and I kicked up our feet upstairs during the opening, which was a band called the Dead 60's.</p><p>They were alright, I couldn't really hear what the lead singer was saying, but whatever. Afterward, when we were waiting for garbage to come on, Jen and I saw them come out from backstage. She told me to go talk to them, but what was I going to say? &quot;Thank you for not playing so long, I couldn't hear you anyways.&quot;</p><p>I must confess, there was some pre-show nastiness that occurred with this&#8212;well, I want to use a filthy word, but after some contemplation, I have decided not to even dignify it and just forget about it. Basically, it ruined the show for Jen, and I was really bitter about it to. Some people just don't have pit hospitality. I just hope Duke threw his guitar pick into her eye.</p><p>They opened with some cover by the NIN of Johnny Cash. After that they ripped into &quot;Queer&quot; and &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; after that. I enjoyed &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; probably the most of any of the songs. It was funny because Shirley started to sing some lyrics early before the guitars cresendoed, and I could see Duke look at her when she realized what she did. She just shrugged and they played through it. Not many people probably caught that.</p><p>&quot;Hammering in my Head&quot; went really well. They did the same song at Music Midtown in 2002 with this cool intro which may have been there this time too. I wonder why they come back to that song so much during the live shows? They even seemed apologetic during the encore when they insisted on playing &quot;Sex is not the Enemy,&quot; a new song. How many people in there have <em>really</em> heard &quot;Hammering in my Head&quot;? I just wish they'd have the same confidence for their newer songs, because they are really good.</p><p>They only played one song from <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, which was disappointing. I know some of their other sets have included &quot;Cherry Lips,&quot; that would have been alot of fun to hear on an encore. An interview I read today had Butch admitting that he sees the new album as getting over the &quot;hangover&quot; that was <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, which was beginning promotion the exact same week as 9/11. I know the timing was tragic, but the album is still very good, and they should support it on the tour as much as they did all the others. That's probably my first complaint.</p><p>Anyways, &quot;Vow&quot; was awesome.  Shirley started that one talking about how amazing it is to be on tour over 10 years after that song was released. I saw them play the song at Music Midtown too, and it doesn't cease to be amazing. Being so close to Duke and Steve as they play those guitars&#8212;it's just amazing.</p><p>&quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; was dedicated to all us garbage fans. I really like that song, and they play it well live. I can't wait to see what they plan to do in a video. I just hope it's not corny.</p><p>They ended the main set with &quot;Why Do You Love Me,&quot; which rocked. They came back for the encore that followed really quickly, which was kind of weird, I thought. I guess they wanted to end the night alittle early.</p><p>During &quot;Sex is not the Enemy&quot;, Shirley stopped the show because a fan near the front appeared to lose consciousness. Oh, don't worry, that wasn't the case at all, they just lost their glasses. Shirley yelled back to Butch to cut the music as the pit crew helped whoever it was find their spectacles. It was funny watching Shirley go from concerned rock star to snickering Scot. She said, &quot;Did they find the glasses?&quot; laughing at us, and proceeded to recount how they had already stopped an earlier show for the same reason. She gave us all good advice, telling us not to forget to tie up our glasses with string before heading out to the garbage show. Fortunate for her, I was wearing contacts 8-)</p><p>After &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; (Jen's favorite of the evening), they closed the show with &quot;Right Between the Eyes,&quot; which I hear will be released in the UK as the next single there. I think it's alright, it's growing on me, but it doesn't touch &quot;Run Baby Run,&quot; which will be released in Europe next. I don't know why they aren't playing that one live. That would have made up for the nastiness from earlier in the evening if they had played it. Oh well.</p><p>Shirley left before the boys. It was cute, cause Butch came downstage, waved to the audience, and gave Duke a hug. God knows he was exhausted after drumming through &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Why Do You Love Me.&quot; It would have been nice to have another encore, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. I bought an expensive t-shirt, dropped Jen off at her car, and sped my way home.</p><p>I had a great time, garbage gave us an awesome performance. I guess the only problem I had was their lack of confidence in their newer music. I felt like they paraded all their best-selling singles before us when they probably could have played some of their most memorable songs like &quot;Parade&quot; or, God forbid, a b-side! Shirley even scoffed at the suggestion of playing &quot;Lick the Pavement,&quot; saying, &quot;We spent 2 and a half years on this record...we're going to play a new song and you're going to like it!&quot; That was cute, and the song was good, but couldn't they play something less recognizable in place of a song like &quot;Queer&quot;? I don't know, they did play &quot;Supervixen,&quot; which is cool, but I wish I could have gotten a more personal performance.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, it was awesome, better then most shows I've been to. Nothing could make garbage less than fabulous. I hope, if anyone else out there reading this went to the show, you enjoyed it as much as I did.</p><p>Anyways, I'll blog on b-sides tomorrow. After that, back to reality :'(</p><p align="center"><a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/yoshi369/album?.dir=2623&.src=ph&store=&prodid=&.done=http%3a//pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/yoshi369/my_photos" target="blank"><img src="garbage4-14.jpg"></a></p><p>Oh, yah, and for pictures of the show, don't forget to click the image above of sexy Shirl telling me that she's in love with me ;-)</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Scarred</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=31','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Bleed Like Me </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
