The Flaming Lips, the 40 Watt:</strong> I went to this concert during my sophomore year, during the spring of 2003. It was the one time I ever saw April in Athens. The concert was so big, it pulled her out of Athens with her boyfriend Matt. Padmini and I think Vicki were also there. I tried to arrive early so I could be one of the audience members who got dressed up in the animal suits from the &quot;Do You Realize?&quot; video. No such luck.<p>The show started with large rubber balls flying through the air. It was a real thrill because the roof of the 40 Watt is so low, almost all of the balls were burst before the band even walked out. Wayne Coyne emerged from backstage in that recognizable suit, and the show began&#8212;with &quot;Fight Test,&quot; I believe. I could be wrong, as phenomenal the show was, I just don't remember. Behind the band was a large high-definition screen that played these bizarre movies during the set. During &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots,&quot; Wayne had this small boxing nun he put on the big screen through a camera in his microphone and he instructed us all to sing along.</p><p>The show was just great, they played alot of songs I loved, and they even played a song I was hoping they would play: &quot;All We Have is Now.&quot; It seemed so unlikely they would play it, but it was one of their last songs. That was just too cool. The intimacy and energy of that show has never been reproduced for me, and I feel privileged to have seen a band like the Flaming Lips in a place like the 40 Watt.</p><p><strong>2. Lauryn Hill, the Classic Center:</strong> My sister and Genevieve went with me for this one. When I heard Lauryn Hill was coming to Athens, I was both shocked and excited. I got up so early that morning to get in line for the show. Though it was my freshman year at UGA and I was poor, I didn't even skimp on the cheap seats. I wanted to be front row, center (though we were more middlish center for the actual show). Jen thought that she'd play alot of the songs from her first album&#8212;the really popular ones. I had heard she was coming out with an MTV Unplugged album, so I wasn't sure what to expect.</p><p>If I could say anything about that concert, it would be that it was less a musical experience as it was a spiritual one for me. She was so candid and open to the audience. She just sat up there with her acoustic guitar and a book of songs, flipping through it, playing chords she had learned, and explaining to us why she had written what she did. It was so beautiful, and I don't think anyone could discern a set list from the whole thing. Jen was bored as hell, but I was so into it.</p><p>My favorite song of the evening was one that didn't show up on the Unplugged album, it was a song called &quot;Selah,&quot; for her daughter. She said she wrote to song specifically to be different than the song to her son Zion. It's funny how she denounced everything &quot;To Zion&quot; ever stood for in favor of the stark reality of her selfishness she revealed in &quot;Selah.&quot; She told us that everyone wants to believe when she found out she was having a baby that she felt an overwhelming sense of happiness and entitlement, but &quot;Selah&quot; told it how it really was. We're all selfish and cruel, and I really value her and her music for telling us that.</p><p><strong>3. Madonna, Washington D.C.:</strong> I wouldn't think this show would have been so high up on this list, but it really did give me a profound respect for the material girl. Though I listen to a most bizarre variety of music (who listens to Japanese mp3's?), I do listen more or less to pop music. Madonna is a goddess of pop, and I guess I just never realized it. I mean, I didn't even own a real copy of <em>The Immaculate Collection</em>, I only had a burned copy of it.</p><p>The show started with this really cool jumbo screens with these really lavishly produced videos of a woman (I assumed it was Madonna) doing all this strange poses. The screens started to fall away and separate, eventually falling back to their own sides of the stage. Then, all of a sudden, as the odd &quot;book excerpt&quot; sequence was over, I hear the words, &quot;What are you looking at!&quot; come blaring out of the silence. I mean, from that point on, the show was just awesome. Her stuff from <em>American Life</em> was even good, I couldn't believe it.</p><p>My favorite song was when she dedicated &quot;Crazy For You&quot; to the fans. That was really nice, she hadn't played many of her classics at her shows in recent years. My second favorite was &quot;Vogue,&quot; which as a consequence was swiftly added to my mp3 collection and given 5 stars on my iPod.</p><p><strong>4. U2, Phillips Arena:</strong> I went to this show to see garbage perform live for the first time ever in my life. They were opening for U2, and though Missy and I were poor little freshman (we got seats <em>behind</em> the main stage), we were able to make it down to the show. garbage rocked, as per usual. Seeing that they don't play very much of their <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> stuff nowadays, it's nice to know I got to hear songs like &quot;Drive You Home&quot; and &quot;Cherry Lips&quot; live at some point.</p><p>U2 was just amazing. It's like a pilgrimage, everyone needs to go at least once. Bono is just so alive on stage, and he is so intuned to the audience (and he even shot us glances from the stage&#8212;I guess he felt sorry for us cheap skates). At one point, he brought a fan up who had a sign saying it was his dream to play guitar with the band, at least once. Bono made that dream a reality, and that was just so awesome to see. Also, all the 9/11 tribute stuff just a mere 2 months since the tragedy was all really touching. I got chills.</p><p><strong>5. Garbage, the Tabernacle:</strong> I'm putting this her just for good measure. Sure, it might be higher on the list if they played &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; or did some fabulous stunt like they did in D.C. (did you hear about that??) It still rocked to hear &quot;Vow&quot; and &quot;Supervixen&quot; and also to see Shirley chew us out for dropping our glasses.</p><p>I totally just wrote all about this, that uber entry is still around for your perusing, so get to it. </p><center><hr color="#FFFAFA" width="50%" noshade></center><br><p>That is all.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Awake</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=35','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Lauryn Hill - <em>So Much Things to Say</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
