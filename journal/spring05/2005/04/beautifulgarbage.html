      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/beautifulgarbageicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />By the time I had made it to college, I was well on my way to being a bone fide garbage freak.  I couldn't wait to listen to the first studio album since I had been a fan of the band. At UGA, I had the luxury of a high speed internet connection.  In the months before <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> was released, I soaked up every piece of information on the forthcoming album. Studio diaries, album cover scans, 30 second clips&#8212;you name it, I knew about it, I had it on my hard drive.<p>I downloaded &quot;Androgyny&quot; first as a radio rip when I was at home visiting. I didn't like it very much. I mean, it's not horrible, it was just so different&#8212;I had expected something more rock and less pop. The video came out with mediocre fanfare (possible due to the nation-wide depression brought about by 9/11). I thought it was sexy, but Shirley was certainly going places with her style that most fans were not comfortable with. I dug it though. Better that they made this <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> and not<em> Version 3.0</em>.</p><p>I thought <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> was going to change the world! I had this crazy idea that after toiling months in a cramped studio in Madison WI, garbage would emerge and silence the cacophony of Christina Aguilera (whom Shirley famously referred to in her studio diary as a cunt) and Britney Spears. I couldn't wait until October 2nd, I had to have my revolution now!</p><p>The album had leaked, of course. I was bored one night in Russell Hall with high speed Internet&#8212;so yah. I did it. I started with &quot;So Like a Rose,&quot; which I assumed would be moody like <em>Version 2.0</em>'s concluding track. It was pretty good. It always seemed alot more existential and mature than any other garbage song I'd heard. It didn't stop there, though. By the end of that week, I had downloaded every track.</p><p>&quot;Cherry Lips&quot; really stuck out on the album. I had heard a 30 second clip of it a week or two earlier, and I was instantly annoyed by it. Way too different and way too sugary. But, like most first impressions, there was more to be seen. That particular song, like the album as a whole, was exploding with  pop&#8212;but it was earned. The whole tuba through the wa-wa peddle was an excellent base for the song, and it had a way of crescendoing to that level of obnoxious pop that seemed natural and sustained. The album was able to achieve this very well.</p><p>On first listen, I really dug &quot;Drive You Home.&quot; I thought it was really sweet and endearing. It was stripped down&#8212;not many bells and whistles on that one. It took me a while to realize it was almost a ballad to the lover you keep but leave behind, like Shirley's husband Eddie.</p><p>&quot;Parade&quot; and &quot;Breaking Up The Girl&quot; were some of my favorite freshman year anthems. I remember romping home after getting an A on one of my English papers listening to &quot;Breaking Up The Girl.&quot; &quot;Parade&quot; was always my running song. Like most fans, I found &quot;Can't Cry These Tears&quot; and &quot;Till the Day I Die&quot; to be really annoying, but in retrospect, they're both special in their own ways.</p><p>My favorite song on the album had to be &quot;Cup of Coffee.&quot; It was one of the tracks that called back to the emotion of <em>Version 2.0</em>. The lyrics were bare, but very real. The melody and noises were noticeably haunting and strangely comforting. Though I didn't recognize it at first, this song became very special for me.</p><p>The album was not promoted well. I think alot of people missed out on a quality album, but granted, it came at a difficult time. Not even one month since 9/11. Regardless of any of that, I still think it's valuable. In the past 3 years, I've probably listened to it the most often of the 3 albums. It was always the most current, mature, and fun.</p><hr align="center" color="FFFAFA" width="50%" noshade><br><p>But not anymore. It's been a while since I've got a good dose of garbage. I suppose <em>Garbage</em>, <em>Version 2.0</em>, <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> and a cavalcade of b-sides just aren't enough anymore. After a difficult 2001-2002 tour and a brief break-up, garbage has released their 4th studio album: <em>Bleed Like Me</em>. Years of waiting are at an end.</p><p>Of course, if you want to see how that turns out&#8212;tune in tomorrow.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Obsessed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=29','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Cup of Coffee </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
