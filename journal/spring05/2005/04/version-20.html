      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/version2.0icon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />The first garbage album I ever bought was <em>Version 2.0</em>. I was an obnoxious teenager with a part-time job and lots of money to burn. I was browsing the new release wall at Media Play and I remember picking up the album and considered buying it.  I had heard a steady stream of hits already from the album, so it seemed like a good investment.  I had no idea.<p>At first, like all the albums I owned, I only listened to the popular singles. &quot;Push It&quot;, &quot;I Think I'm Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; were all played often on my Mazda's CD player. I didn't really have a particular favorite, though. It was pop music! Nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>Jen's good friend Emily suggested that I listen to one of her favorite songs on the album, &quot;Sleep Together.&quot; I realize it's not one of the band's best songs, but it opened for me a world I had never been before. I really liked to song, and I guess I got sick of clicking the back button on my CD player, so I just kept listening.</p><p>I became notorious for this album. I listened to nothing else in my car, whether I was driving to school or work, I had this album on. I played it so much, that to this day my sister still recognizes every song&#8212;and even sings along!</p><p>The songs on this album really don't stand out as strongly as the songs on <em>Garbage</em> did. <em>Version 2.0</em> was always more of a package to me. There's something about the way the album begins with &quot;Temptation Waits&quot; and just sends you into the stratosphere. The whole album blended so many different styles of music and wove them together so beautifully. Disco, pop, country, rock, folk&#8212;all of it was there. Shirley Manson also produced some of the most touching lyrics I have ever heard.</p><p>One thing that always bugged me was my originial association for the song "I Think I'm Paranoid." I would listen to the album&#8212;particularly that song&#8212;when I was working at Kroger and I was on my break. I remember listening to the song while eating Baked Lays. For the longest time, I couldn't get that strange connection out of my head everytime I heard the song. It would be a shame to hate the song based solely on the fact that it recalled miserable days at Kroger.</p><p>I remember blairing &quot;Medication&quot; out of my car's stereo the day I came home and saw that my dad bought my sister a really nice used car, passing me up in my shitmobile, making me feel absolutely worthless. I listened to the lyrics, &quot;Nobody gives a damn about me / Or anybody else&quot; as I drove to the gym and just ran my frustrations and pain away.</p><p>I really experienced &quot;You Look So Fine&quot; for the first time one day waiting in the car outside of Kroger. My sister had to run in for something and I sat outside, on a drizzly day, with my window rolled down. I had the music low&#8212;it was hypnotising. The lyrics were the most profound, emotional, and bare that I have ever heard. There's not one thing wrong with that song, it's absolutely perfect. I return to it every single time I feel dejected and alone. It personifies love&#8212;a perfectly obsessive, yet unrequited love, that achieves nothing but pain.</p><p>After the sublime experience of <em>Version 2.0</em>, I wanted more. I picked up <em>Garbage</em>, as I have already explained, but it wasn't enough. I frequented the website, read the studio journals, anxiously awaiting the band's third album...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Knocked Down</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=28','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>You Look So Fine</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
