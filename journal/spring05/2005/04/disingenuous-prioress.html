      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/treeinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />My last paper is done! I worked on it for several hours on Sunday night after taking a necessary break to watch the L-word. That show really is good, I thought the episode Sunday would suck, but it turned out to be really good. After that spot of sugary goodness, I plugged away at a paper titled, &quot;Chaucer the Poet and the Anti-Semitic Prioress.&quot; I think it turned out really well. I don't think I've every researched as thoroughly for any other paper. I think, as per tradition of my recent undergraduate papers, the thesis was provocative and poised. The argument was interesting and inspired. I am quite honestly anticipating an A. I won't find out that until Monday, though.<p>This week, I'm focusing on getting a job! My resume is done, I'm about to get my cover letter critiqued, and I will hopefully be sending out a flood of &quot;hire me please!&quot; packets very soon. I have my eyes set on this one group of papers in Maryland. That would be awesome, I think the qualifications they are looking for match me well. Hopefully it's a good fit. I've also been interested in some papers out in California, but my friends and family keep giving me objections like, &quot;It costs too much to live out there! It's too far!&quot; I don't care, the farther the better. I just hope it's sunny wherever I end up.</p><p>This Saturday, I'm going to run in the Athens Twilight 5K Run. This will be the first time ever I've been at UGA that I've participated in anything to do with Athens Twilight. I'm not sure what I was doing the last two years&#8212;I think I was being a sore thumb or something. My first year, I remember I was on the outs with Gen and Missy and I went home to fix my alternator or something. How lame.</p><p>I'm really excited about Saturday, though. As any Blog reader would know, I've been training for months. It hasn't been necessarily for this 5K, I've just been running in general, and my stamina is up so much more than it was when I ran that Jingle Bell 5K last December. Wouldn't it be cool if I qualified for the 1 mile race? I highly doubt it, but I will certainly try to set a personal best. Hopefully bananas and smoothies will greet me at the finish line. Oh joy!</p><p>I should also mention that I will be having my postponed tofu party <em>this Saturday!</em> That's right, all you tofu hungry jerks had better save some room (or make some tofu of your own, because it's a potluck!) I mentioned to Padmini that we should set up a facebook party group for it, but she vetoed that idea. I guess you'll just have to announce to me your desire to go, and I'll forward the much needed directions. It should be a night of vegetarian deliciousness.</p><p>Maybe I'll finally do something I want to do tonight. The Junior Blogs are done, I just need to finish writing the retrospective Junior Blog thingy. Could I finish it tonight? Don't see why not, it's not like I have a paper to write. We'll see.</p><p>I think I'll go get some pizza and pick up that new New Order album, for now. Thank God it's Tuesday.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Contemplative</td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
