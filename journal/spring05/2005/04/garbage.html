      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/garbageicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />The first garbage album was released in 1995.  I was 12 years old&#8212;far too young to care, sadly.  I  didn't buy the album when it came out.  I wasn't fortunate enough  to get that first single &quot;Vow&quot; in its legendary metal casing.  I was just a sniveling brat kid, so I missed out.</p><p>What I do remember, though, is hearing the music. Though it wasn't released on the album, &quot;#1 Crush&quot; on the <em>Romeo + Juliet</em> soundtrack really made waves with me. I remember turning the volume up in my room and bobbing my head to that song. I was living in Boca Raton at the time. I also recall hearing &quot;Stupid Girl,&quot; probably the most recognizable song from the album. That song was notorious for me, particularly, because everytime it came on the radio I would belt out the chorus sarcastically toward my sister. Oh, yeah, she appreciated that.</p><p>Though I'm sure I heard &quot;Only Happy When it Rains,&quot; I don't remember it ever resonating with me way back then. I just wasn't that into the alternative scene. My debut-album abstinence ended around the fall of 1999, though. I had fallen so very hard for <em>Version 2.0</em> and had really gotten into garbage. And as the legend goes, I was watching some crappy MTV game show Webriot when the video for &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot; came on. Suddenly, I was hooked. I went out the next day and got the album.</p><p>Needless to say, it rocked. It took me a while to give the album a decent chance, though. I had it ingrained in my head that album tracks that weren't singles were worse than dirt, and I never listened to them. That changed, thankfully.  I remember listening to &quot;Fix Me Now&quot; around the time I was making my last ditch effort to be straight. I was trying to take this girl Audrey to my Junior prom. When I was driving to her house to pick her up on what could only be considered a lame attempt to court her, I started listening to the song. I guess you could say it had some &quot;special significance,&quot; as I hoped she could &quot;fix&quot; those darned homosexual urges. Needless to say, <em>that</em> didn't work.</p><p>I also really got into &quot;Stroke of Luck.&quot; It's still one of my favorite songs off the album to this day. It's one of those songs that I'd listen to while driving home from work at Target down those lonely roads in Kennesaw. God knows the song's a downer, but we all need a good kick in the gut every now and then. </p><p>I got really into &quot;Vow&quot; during my trip to Europe in the spring of 2000. I picked up the special edition of <em>Version 2.0</em> in London, and it came with this nifty 4 track bonus disk of garbage playing live at the 1998 Roskilde Festival. The disk ended with just about the most high-energy version of &quot;Vow&quot; I had ever heard, and it still rocks my socks off to this day. I listen to that song when I feel so beaten and alone and need motivation to get my ass off the floor and put up a fight. The album track rocks too, though. It sounds so disgusting and trashy, but it just comes together so beautifully by the end.</p><p>Nowadays, I listen to <em>Garbage</em> when I feel depressed. It's dark enough to accompany such moods, but it's uplifting in the sense that you know things are going to get better. It's not my favorite album, probably my least favorite. The sound is unique and outstanding, but undeveloped.</p><p>Fortunately, garbage's seconds helping, <em>Version 2.0</em>, took the moody electic-alternative rifts to a whole new world.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Vengeful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=27','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Vow</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
