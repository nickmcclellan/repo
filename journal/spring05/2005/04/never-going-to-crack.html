      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/wdylmshirlicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I had planned a fabulous tofu party Saturday.  I invited Diane, and we were going to learn how to make tofu with Padmini.  We had never learned.  I have all the ingredients, of course, but I'm afraid I won't grasp the technique straight off. I figured Padmini  would be able to show us.  Well, *past perfect tense* <em>had planned</em> a tofu party this Saturday.  That has been postponed.<p>Expatriate <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/nicole.html" target="_blank">Nicole</a> is back in the USA! She called me today and we talked while I was on the way home. It's so nice to have her back. She's having a cookout on Saturday, so I have to go back to see her. I mean, I haven't seen her in almost two years, can you believe that? I mean, the last time she saw me, I had gotten my face burned off from that horrible flaming shot of Everclear. <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/Spring%2003/7-6journal.html" target="_blank">Remember that??</a></p><p>Well, besides expatriate best friend news, Wednesday was my last ESOL class. This week wasn't anything special, but I do want to say something about the experience as a whole.</p><p>I didn't want to do anything this year. No leadership. No Lambda and its fucking politics. Only me and what would get me into my career. Diane told me last fall that she was going to an info meeting on teaching English to speakers of other languages and I told her I'd go along (half thinking I'd probably duck out or something). Jerm has been doing ESOL since the fall of 2003. He would do them when I hosted Lambda meetings, and I'd beg him to come, and he'd tell me, &quot;It's more important than Lambda.&quot; I never believed him. Certainly my hard work for Lambda was more important than some boring community service.</p><p>Needless to say, last fall was a complete hell for me. Not many know the full story (though I may elaborate in the Senior Blog), but there was one thing that never felt sullied or forsaken. Every Thursday night, when I would met up with Diane and teach a roomful of people basic English skills, I felt good about myself. I felt that, despite the burden of outrageous circumstances that I had to endure, I was untouchable and free for that one hour and thirty minutes every week. Nothing could discredit the good I was doing. No one could deny that I had done a selfless thing.</p><p>Last year, when I was an officer for Lambda, I rarely felt that. I instead felt embattled and pressured to do what others thought I was supposed to do. It was like any real difference we made with any individual was immaterial to getting a body to fill a space in a room. Though I tend to gauge my Lambda experience by personal, meaningful moments (meeting Antonio, watching the selfish freshman meet their life-long  friends at the Lambda picnic we organized though they deny Lambda ever had any value for them ever), as a whole, it never really mattered on the larger cosmic scale. It was never enough. </p><p>I guess I'm happy I did something this year that truly did. ESOL meant something, and I'm glad I could be a part of it.</p><p>I showed Martin my resume today. He liked it, he liked my design examples, and he commended me on my desire to evacuate the south. He said so many graduates get jobs in Georgia and they're unwilling to go out into the world and experience it. I am glad I'm leaving. To tell you the truth, I can't wait. I wish I could have left months ago.</p><p>Also, Marilia called last night and we talked for almost 2 hours. I love my expatriate friends. Just because they left the country doesn't mean I would ever forget them. Oh, and she's got facebook now, so add her! Add her because you <em>know</em> she's sexy!</p><p>I should sleep now. I can't believe I finished the Fink paper early. I shouldn't have got ice cream, though. Bad me.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Flighty</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=30','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Run Baby Run </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
