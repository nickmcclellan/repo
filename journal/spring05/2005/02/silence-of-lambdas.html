Ok, well, not exactly given up, per se, but I'm not going to force myself to finish everything to compromise superior content. I did bust my ass to do pages for Laura and Mary-Kate, which I promised I'd do a long time ago, and I did a much needed update to alot of pages (Genevieve's page <em>really</em> needed it). You can check out my hard labors by clicking on the above link, underlined for your convenience (Thank you CSS!)<p>The rumblings of a party are brewing in the back of my mind. Marilia is leaving on the 23rd for Chile, and I want to have a party for her. She seems to want to see everyone there, so I guess she can have one last swipe at them&#8212;something like that. Well, no, I think she just wants to have a good time. I was thinking today I probably can't muster the numbers I used to be able to, but I think maybe I can make an earnest effort to bring some action to a dull Spring Semester. When's the last time anything interesting happened, anyways?</p><p>I promised myself I wouldn't say anything about this, but where's the fun in not throwing salt in the wound, right? Some interesting e-mails came out last night about the state of the Lambda Alliance. Basically, it's arguable whether things have taken a turn for the worse. Attendance hasn't been stellar since even I was a board member. I think it's pointless to point the finger (per se), but I do believe this version of the organization really does need to die. I don't think the current crop (minus Kyle, who I have an obnoxious admiration of) really knows what the campus needs from a GLBT organization. I'm not Mr. Know-It-All, either, for that matter. I think it's up to the freshman, as bad as that sounds. I think after a real time of death and renewal, Lambda will be very different from what we all recognize.</p><p>And what's this I hear about the emphasis returning the the Lambda Office? Wow, is that a delayed echo, or was someone finally listening to three generations of dearly departed Board members. Just indifference here though, I did my part for king and country. And, as far as anyone else is concerned, I did it well.</p><p>I'll be working on the Galleries Page now. If anyone happens to have any me-related pictures they'd like to send my way, don't hesitate. I could really use the content.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Empty</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=6','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Lovesong</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
