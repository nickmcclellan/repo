      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/brandylj.jpg" width="100" align="left" /><strong>They're playing garbage on the radio!</strong></p><p>Finally! I got to hear the new single, &quot;Why Do You Love Me.&quot; It was so awesome too, it couldn't have happened any better. I got a call from Jennifer during my ESOL class, and I called her afterward to ask her what she wanted. She asked me if there was a new garbage album coming out, and I was like, &quot;What? Well, yes. Why do you ask?&quot;<p>Suddenly, it hit me. She'd heard the song before me! <em>Who hears a garbage song before I do??</em> I was obviously very peeved. It turns out she had heard a DJ on 99X boasting that he had the song and would play it every hour. I listened to the station all the way home from class.</p><p>Just after I was getting of the loop at College Station, it happened. I heard the song! It was the first new garbage song since I downloaded a rough cut of &quot;Androgyny&quot; in my basement in Marietta, just a week before I went off to UGA. That was a very impersonal moment. Hearing it off of my laptop speakers just seemed unnatural and artificial, and I think that might be the reason &quot;Androgyny&quot; never really grew on me.</p><p>Hearing &quot;Why Do You Love Me&quot; in my car was so much more fun! I nearly got in an accident weaving through calls, singing along, &quot;I get back up, and I do it again!&quot; This single is different than &quot;Androgyny&quot;, too. For one, my first impression of the song is that it's lacking alot of the bells and whistles of songs from albums like Version 2.0 and Beautifulgarbage. It's very high energy, and reminds me of &quot;Push It&quot;, but not nearly as dark. There's alot of pop in the song, but I don't think that's a bad thing. It's got a whole lot more rock to back it up. It's loud, it's obnoxious, and Shirley's angry.</p><p>I do actually have a copy of the lyrics. I don't think it's the most impressive lyrical piece on the album, for sure. I was at first alittle phased by some of their choice of words, but I think the energy is what really brings the song together, and I can certainly see myself speeding down the highway listening to this, or trekking very swiftly through campus on my bike. I absolutely can't wait til' I have the mp3. For the next week, I'm a WinMX junkie. Someone leak it, fast!</p><p>I maintain that I'm  going to be unspoiled on this album. I refuse to download anything that will not be released on a single before April 12th, when the album is released. I hear that they will be releasing a US single in March, so I will actually have the opportunity to legitimately purchase it and rip the b-sides. Oh, I can't wait for new b-sides! It's going to be an exciting year! I love it when a new garbage album comes out. This is the second one for me, so I'm really going to enjoy it!</p><p>Another reason for the Brandy face is the fact that I had a really productive day, and I made it all the way up to Park Hall on my bike. I usually get really tired after my work out and make it to Journalism to walk the rest of the way. I felt like pushing it today though, and I made it to class early for once. And I got to go to lunch with Leena, which is so much fun :-D</p><p>Well, it's time to be miserable again. Adios. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Good</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=13','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Why Do You Love Me</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
