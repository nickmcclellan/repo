Currently, I'm sitting in the library after eating a delicious M&amp;M and chocolate chip cookie along with a refreshing freshly squeezed lemonade and a bag of Baked Lays.  So far, I have accomplished the top two objectives on my list of &quot;things-to-do,&quot; and interestingly enough, I also ran into someone I haven't seen since my first semester here at UGA (She asked me if I was still crazy about garbage, and I think I got alittle embarrassed).<p>Well, I don't really have a heck of a whole lot to say. I'm going to try to get published before next Monday on an article that I wrote last semester. I'm also seeking the elusive graduation check I've been putting off. Oh, and I'm also determined to get Jennifer to clean the living room. We'll be talking tonight.</p><p>Catching up on things this week, don't you remember? Anyways, a few things that have been bothering me.</p><p>For one, I don't think I'll ever get used to the Ramsey locker room. Everytime I walk in there to change into my weight training garb, there's some bare-assed guy drying his nuts w/ a towel. I mean, I  like naked men as much as the next gay guy, but do I have to be bombarded with nudity as soon as I walk into the locker room? I've never been comfortable with locker rooms&#8212;there's just something too Greek about the whole thing. Why don't these guys cover themselves up, or at least try to? The less time I spend in there, the better.</p><p>Also, there are several annoying things about the iPod. For one, why is the clock a completely useless feature? It seems that my iPod randomly lets its battery supply diminish <em>even</em> when the damned thing is off, and once I've charged it again, it's time to party like it's 1999?! Well, more accurately 2000. For someone who's sworn off his beloved watch, I find this constant adjustment to be extremely bothersome.</p><p>And what's up with the thing randomly dying?! I can't tell you how many times I turned that thing on when I was waiting for the bus (keep in mind I used it maybe 2 hours the day before and supposedly turned it off), and then after turning it on, I get that obnoxious Apple logo and a little flicker. All of a sudden, I'm riding the bus without an excuse not to talk to anyone. It's just annoying, that's all.</p><p>I'm going to be late to class if I don't stop now, so toodles. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Annoyed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=8','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Do As Infinity - <em>Shinjitsu no Shi </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
