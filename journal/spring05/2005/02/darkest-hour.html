I guess I got wrapped up in other things, but I hope to accomplish a good send off by the weekend.  I haven't forgotten.<p>For one, on Monday, Genevieve called me and asked if I wanted to run one mile at Ramsey. I said yes, because honestly, one mile at Ramsey is rather pleasant, and I think we could all use a good mile in each one of our days. Well, through some bizarre twist of events, we both ended up forgetting our ID cards, and Genevieve proposed we run our classic 4 mile circuit around campus and downtown Athens.</p><p>I can't believe she manipulated me into running 4 miles! I felt so used as I was bargaining with her, trying to make her commit to something that wouldn't make me feel like a fool. Well, I got her agree to running at my pace as long as we did the full 4 miles. That worked for me, I knew I could finish the circuit, but I didn't want her running off and leaving me if I decided to walk at some point.</p><p>Well, both she and I were surprised to see that I ran a fairly brisk pace the entire 4 miles, and I even managed to beat her in a sprint up the very grueling Lumpkin hill by the Episcopal Center. I think I may try to run this circuit three times a week. I really want to lose some body fat, and torturing myself seems to be the only sure fire way to do that. I have done it twice already this week. We did it yesterday, and it was even easier than Monday! Bring on the 5K, I know I can take it now!</p><p>In other <strong>better</strong> news, I will be going to see garbage play at the Tabernacle on April 14th in Atlanta. I got an e-mail newsletter talking about a garbage.com members only presale opportunity, so I joined the stupid fan club and bought the tickets this morning. My sister is the only one who said she would definitely go with me. She and I went to see garbage at Music Midtown my freshman year together, and that was pretty cool. I went to the whole festival with her. At one point, she even got me to the mosh pit for Incubus, which was kind of scary. That was the last time I saw garbage live.</p><p>But, let's face it, a live performance at Music Midtown is just about the most worthless thing ever! They didn't even headline, and you know they were just playing their older hits to an indifferent crowd who probably didn't even know who they were. garbage at the Tabernacle is going to be so much better! I am dying to hear a b-side performed live. I can't wait until April now. That's going to be the best week ever because their CD will be released that Tuesday. You can expect a Blog-o-licious week then, I can assure you.</p><p>I have a paper to write tonight that I've been putting off until the last minute. There must be a cure for Senioritus. Someone tell me what it is, please!</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Put off</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=15','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Stevie Nicks - <em>Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
