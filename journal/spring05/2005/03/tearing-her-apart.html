      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/brandylj.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'm sorry, I thought my good mood had eroded away into the down pour of the evening thunderstorm, but after staring at my Chaucer paper and reading my teacher's comments again, I am just going to have to slap a big ol' Brandy face on this moment.<p>Ah, <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/brandy.html" target="_blank">Brandy</a>. You were there through so much. I remember the night of my graduation when I came home, donning my cap and gown and various honor cords. Sadly, you were blind and deaf, and you just sort of sat there and let me pet you. You probably wonder who was patting at you (I had taken our then kitten Lily up and down your back), but don't worry dear. You live on, young and vibrant, through glorious Brandy faces, and you make the bad days better because you help us remember the good ones. All rise to recognize the Brandy face!</p><p>Anyways, here's what good ol' Lynn Shutters had to say about my paper:</p><table class="emphasize" width="300" align="center" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>I thought you did an excellent job with this topic, and I really felt like I learned something from reading your paper. Watch your phrasing in a few places, and avoid really long paragraphs like the one on pgs. 3-5. Other than that, great work, and I look forward to reading more!<br><br>A</td></tr></table><p>I think she really got my attention with the exclamation point. I mean, who exclaims when talking about someone's Chaucer paper? Only someone who has been so moved by the excellentness would ever dare to add a SHIFT to their #1. Oh yah, and she went there. And did you notice the A? I mean, no A-, just flat out A. That's a 95, easy.</p><p>What really scared me is she wrote the words <em>felix culpa</em> on the board before she handed the papers back. <em>Felix culpa</em> basically means &quot;happy fall,&quot; referring to Adam and Eve and how it's unfortunate that they lost paradise, but it's alright because the Son of God will come down to redeem them. Shutters was telling us that though we failed miserably on our papers, we would have the opportunity to learn and grow from the experience (and she was also allowing rewrites). I thought I was done for sure. I knew my Spring Break would include some editing...</p><p>Well, that wasn't the case. I don't know why it happened, I mean, did I really write an A paper? She seems to think so. Maybe after 3 years of upper-English hell, I have finally outmatched the English department. I have finally delivered a death blow to the scourge that is Trivedi. I just hope Shutters showed it to him. You know their in the same department: Medi<em>evil</em> Studies.</p><p>Anyways, I should really stop. This just made me feel good, it's one highlight, hopefully the first of many. I mean, resolution is the name of the game, right?</p><p>I want a Grill milkshake. I never thought Master Shake from Aqua Teen Hunger Force could look so appetizing. </p><p>Also, check out my headline in tomorrow's Red &amp; Black:  <strong>'Be Cool' tepid, but not hot</strong>.  That's what my chief copy editor called witty.  You know who's going to be doing layout for the New York Times in the next 10 years?  It's me, bitch</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Accomplished</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=18','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Breaking Up The Girl (Acoustic)</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
