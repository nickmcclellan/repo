      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/kikyoshouldericon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I updated the front page of my website.  I know, surprise surprise! Who goes there anyways?  Anyone who's anyone knows that the Blog is where all the action happens.  Well, you should check it out.  I did some subtle things with the CSS that should expand site wide eventually.  What?  You don't know <em>where</em> the front page is?  Well, since you're too lazy to click that flashy &quot;Thursday&quot; at the top of the page, you can just click this <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/" target="_blank">here</a> ordinary link.  There you go, are you happy?<p>I announced on the front page that I'll be making some more Friends Pages along with the few I still have left to refit. The first up will be Diane, my charming ESOL co-teacher. I've known her for a long time, but she has always been simply a friend of someone who is special to me. I guess that just made her a friend of consequence, not <em>really</em> my own friend.</p><p>Well, that's not true anymore. I've taught with Diane for almost two semesters now and she's introduced me to humus. We've learned names together, we've made bingo boards, and we've depended on eachother almost every week. She's Friends Page worthy, damnit. I just thought I'd let you know that. Plus, there's this cool picture with a bug on her head that I'm going to put on the page. I mean, how cool is that?</p><p>This is the week that I'm going to finish things. I'm going to make that prediction. I don't feel any different right now, but I know this week is different. I don't know how much will change this week, but that's not up to me, is it? I have so much to do. I think I'll kick things off with a nice lunch with Leena. My Chaucer class is due for a skip anyways. It's one of the many perks of getting an A on my last paper.</p><p>I also wanted to post because, first off, I hate Mondays. I hate waking up the for the first time in the same bed next to the same clock going to the same shower riding the same bike to the same bus stop going to the same library that I've gone to the past 3 months. I posted also because I think the L word is a cool show. I think Bette is hot&#8212;I love Jennifer Beals.</p><p>And I posted because I want to say I'm diggin' <em>Skyline Pigeon</em> this night. My mom told me to download it&#8212;she insisted. So I did it, like the good son. I was listening to it when I was running up the hill on Broad St. before Lumpkin St. on Saturday. It was right after Genevieve said her legs hurt too much and she had to walk. I asked her if she wanted me to walk with her. She looked at me and said, &quot;No. You go on.&quot; So I did.</p><p>The song rocks, that's all. Even though today will be the same Monday, the song makes me feel like it could be different. Maybe the time has come.</p><blockquote><em>Just let me wake up in the morning<br>To the smell of new mown hay<br>To laugh and cry, to live and die<br>In the brightness of my day<br><br>I want to hear the pealing bells<br>Of distant churches sing<br>But most of all please free me<br>From this aching metal ring<br>And open out this cage towards the sun<br></em></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Hopeful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=22','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Elton John - <em>Skyline Pigeon</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
