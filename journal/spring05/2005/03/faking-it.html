You probably get enough of my drivel as it is.  The less, the better.<p>I don't feel good tonight. There are several reasons. I felt really good at the beginning of the week, but that good mood has dwindled down to this moment now: writing my second Fink term paper. There's is nothing more miserable. I suppose stressing about it all through Spring Break would be worse, but at least it would give me something to do.</p><p>Why can't writing be like a physical activity? Granted, I am not an athlete, but I think I could work at it. I'd put in long hours, striving to hone my skills. I'd run miles to build my endurance. I'd even do nasty push-ups and crunches every day to be the best writer I can be.</p><p> But no, that's not how it works. Good writing is developed in the back of your head, on a silent Spring afternoon at the library. It happens when you're reading a good book, ignoring whatever distractions surround you, and you suddenly get the spontaneous need to think. You want to think so bad, it just comes out on paper, and all your teachers want to do it shower it with red check marks and give you A's of affection.</p><p>So, no, I'm not a good writer. I'm didn't spend my Thursday afternoon stuffed inside a book. But I will spend my Thursday night scrambling to get by. Anything to make tomorrow, and the next ten days, to go by faster. Maybe no one will notice.</p><p>I don't know what I'm going to do for Spring Break. I've had so much to deal with in the past two months, I really haven't tried to deal with the more unimportant things. I think I'll go see my sister. I'd like to continue to run and work out. I would have liked to go to Sarasota to see my cousin, but instead I think I'll take my car to get its brakes fixed, and maybe ride my bike around Athens. You know, one last time.</p><p> I may also tweak out my Freshman and Sophomore Year Blogs. I've been tinkering with CSS, trying to shape up my layout. So far, I can't figure out how to get my layers to stop humping eachother. It's like a CSS table orgy, it's disgusting.</p><p>Tomorrow, this paper will be done. I'll look at the finished product, amazed and thankful for the work I am about to do.</p><p>Never break the chain.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Listless</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=19','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Alison Krauss - <em>It Doesn't Matter</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
