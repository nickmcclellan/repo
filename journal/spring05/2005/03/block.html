      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/inutreeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'm going to take a break.  Yup, a break.  Of course, we all have a break this week, but as per tradition, the Blog will not appear next week.  My post will appear sometime around Saturday though detailing my adventure for the week, so don't fret.  I plan on doing some good ol' fashioned HTML Bloggin'.  So look forward to that.<p>The paper last night could have been a mediocre success or a complete failure. Suffice it to say, I was very distressed throughout the evening. I kept waking up like it was time to go to school and freaking out thinking I had overslept. I mean, you would think if you had four hours to sleep after laboring hours on a worthless paper, you'd fall right to sleep, but that wasn't the case last night. Nope, I was considerably distressed.</p><p>At this moment, I'm feeling mildly sick. After weeks of resisting the plague of various colds that have claimed many of my friends (Jerm's been sick it seems every week), I have finally succumbed to the beast. It's not that bad, though I decided not to do any working out or running today. I figured I was pretty spent from the paper, and should probably give my body a break. I rewarded its good behavior by buying an overpriced Odwalla Strawberry-Banana smoothie and forcing it down my throat (I thought I'd like it, but it had orange juice in it). I don't understand why it had orange juice in it, though. Shouldn't it be called Strawberry-Banana-<em>Orange</em> smoothie instead? I tried, but I can't help it: I don't like orange juice, and there's nothing anyone can do about it.</p><p>I got my tickets to the April 14th garbage concert today. Row G2. Is that close? It's general admission, but I've never been to the Tabernacle, so I don't know what it means. I know that week I'll be sublimely happy. It's beyond this mental block I have in my mind, when I know things will be very different. I think that concert is going to be the icing on the cake for me.</p><p> This might sound strange, but garbage is like the one thing in my fucked up life that truly belongs to me. It's always been there, through everything, and it's still right here beside me. I don't know why, but listening to garbage sometimes just makes me feel so alive. Our favorite music always does that, I'm sure. God bless it.</p><p>Here's some good news. Jerm and I were walking into Ramsey yesterday, and these students were handing out copies of the spring Informer. Yup, the magazine <em>I've</em> been published in. Don't read the story, though. It blows big time. It makes me want to cry.</p><p>Ok, so this Spring Break, I plan to finish alot of things. Work past that mental block. I'm also writing a poem. Maybe I can finish my first draft, send it off to my old creative writing teacher, and get some feedback. Gotta get my brakes fixed. See my sister.</p><p>Oh, and take a break. I'll just have to start that now.</p><p>And, just in case you need me, you know how to find me, don't pretend like you don't.</p><p> I'll be around.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Alone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=20','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Incubus - <em>Wish You Were Here </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
