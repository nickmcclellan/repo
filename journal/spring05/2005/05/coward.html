Yeah, I'm glad I did the entry in Spanish. I sort of had this goal of writing at least one entry a week in Spanish. I set it for myself sometime in the middle of the semester. Ambitious, I know, and at least I can say I did one of them. One thing about writing in Spanish: it takes <em>forever!</em><p>Anyways, I just watched the new Inuyasha. I just thought I'd point out the spineless thing those nasty bastards at Adult Swim did. Tonight was the long awaited introduction of Jakotsu, a homosexual who admires Inuyasha and Miroku. I don't know much about homosexuals in anime, but I imagine it can't be that good. It's still kind of exciting to see a gay man in my favorite anime, so I was wondering how that would be translated to the&#8212;<em>shutter</em>&#8212;conservative American audience. Turns out they choose the most obvious female voice for Jakotsu (even though he sports some ripped arms and chest) and hope that no one is the wiser. What a jib!</p><p>In other news, I have been so studiously chipping away at the mounds of work I have left to do for my website. I remade the Spring '04 page and icons and hope to finish the rest of the pages over the next few months. I also made this nifty graphic that's going to be the major navigation bar of the site. It's so exciting, looking back on all I've done for the website over the years, and thinking about how I'm going to represent that when I finally step away from it. I feel like I have this very special complete view of my years in Athens that I can look back and treasure for years to come. It's pretty awesome.</p><p>I want to make another website, maybe a few months after I move away. I just don't know what it's going to look like. I want it to be completely different from &quot;Thursday.&quot; I was thinking today I'd like it to feature some photography. I had this idea of making a bunch of content and crafting a site around that. I can do anything with good quality content. I really need to get over stealing so much from copyrighted material (Inuyasha, Buffy, garbage, etc.)</p><p>When this is over I will definitely take a break from Blogging for a while. I feel overexposed. I want to be off the radar for a while. I'm really looking forward to having the opportunity to disappear.</p><p>Well, enough of this random crap. I want to go to bed.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Anxious</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=44','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Dracula's Castle</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
