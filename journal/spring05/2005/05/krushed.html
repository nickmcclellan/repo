      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/ccbmessicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Oh, the craziness that was last night. As much as it would have been such a comfort that things would have happened as they usually did, I think what I got instead was alot better.  This is long, so sit back, cause it's going to be a while.<p>So I went to Krush Girls last night. My intention was the be social and dancing and just fun. I thought one more  dance with Missy would be all I needed to end this right. I didn't do that, exactly, I think that maybe all the drinking and blacking out got in the way of my fun with her. Plus, Missy has a nasty habit of leaving with some random guy, and last night was no exception. So it was just me and Leena, and boy did we have a great time...</p><p>Ok, so Friday I was dead set on having a drunken fun time. I went running because I had a really shitty Thursday night. I ate a whole box of cookies, which sounds glamorous, but it was really sad and depressing. I kept lite on the food Friday, as a result, and I went for a nice long run that helped to make me feel alot better. There were points when I almost started walking, but I perservered and ended up running the whole thing. Go me.</p><p>Missy and I went to Leena's and I had about 4 glasses of wine before diving into some Bacardi O. I tried to talk to Dille and not stutter and slur, but that was a lost cause. I kept saying things like, &quot;I don't talk bad, I am an English major...no, I have an English degree!&quot; I wasn't very convincing. I did get to kiss Leena though. She had such wonderful, pillowy lips. By the end of the night, when I was craving kisses, I just looked at her and said, &quot;Pillowy lips!&quot; and she knew it was time to fork over the goods.</p><p>On our way to Krush Girls we saw a shadowy cop down against a dark wall and I made very vocal my problem with the creepiness factor of the whole thing. I made some drunken phone calls; left a voicemail with Padmini, got to tell April I loved her. It's so nice to be in touch with her again.</p><p>The experience at the 40 Watt is a blur. I know when we got there Leena ran into her friend Aaron and Missy and I had to wait while they worked out some issues. He was so drunk, he fell on the floor right on his head. I was really adamant about how he fell right on his head, I wouldn't stop talking about it. I saw a few people that I knew and thus gave lovin' to. Julie was out last night. I know my behavior must have been a shock to her, she hasn't ever seen me off campus before. Kyle was there as well. There were a few other people I knew but didn't say hi to. I was too drunk to be too social, so don't take it personally. I couldn't really <em>see</em> people, per se&#8212;like I couldn't look for them, you know? I mean, you'd have to smack me upside the head for me to notice you, it was that bad.</p><p>I don't remember what happened to Missy once Leena came back from walking Aaron outside. I just know Leena, being the supervixen she is, got us all the way to the front by the stage where I tried to cobble together an array of pelvic thrusts to form a working dance. She requested &quot;Motown Philly&quot; from one of the guys on stage (they apparently have fond memories of Leena from New Year's). That's probably the only song I remember <em>hearing</em> that night. I wasn't paying much attention.</p><p>After that point, I was basically going back and forth from the bar and the stage. It's really bizarre, I opened a tab and started buying Leena and me Long Island Iced Teas. I know I shouldn't have done that, I had had way too much to drink at that point. I brought Leena her drink and she kept setting it down on the stage and I kept reaching for it, reminding her to finish it up. I think I even dropped my drink at some point, which I know was an annoyance to my fellow dancers (Leena said I spilt alcohol on her arm).</p><p>The highlight of the night came when I told Leena we should take off our shirts and dance. We did so for a good 5 minutes, and Leena said everyone was looking at us. Scary, like I said, I didn't really have the ability to <em>see</em> people in the state I was in, which was probably a really good thing. Leena was really hot in just her bra though, I was very impressed. We put our shirts back on, sadly, and after that, I remember <strong>nothing</strong>. I was impressed by the fact that though I blacked out, I had the good sense to close my tab. How much does that rock? </p><p>From what I've put together from what Leena and Gen told me, we waited around for a while after the lights came on to look for Missy. Gen called me and I kept asking her if she knew where Missy was. Despite the fact that she told me that Missy had got to Spring Lake with some guy, it didn't sink in for me, so I kept asking her, all the while referring to Gen as Leena or Missy (I apparently forget people's names when I black out). Leena  scored me a free tofu dog while she was making out with this guy Winston on a bench. I really resent not being aware of such a delicious experience (the tofu dog, not the making out). It was my first tofu dog and I can't even remember what it tasted like! After that, I apparently pulled Leena off the boy and we somehow got home (though both of us don't remember how).</p><p>Leena says when I got to her place I insisted on taking a shower. I'm really impressed that I was able to do that and somehow manage to get all my clothes back on (except my pants) without putting anything on backwards or something. I fell asleep on Leena's chair. I woke up in the most uncomfortable position too. I don't know why my drunk self didn't take advantage of the couch a mere 3 feet away. What can I say, I'm just an idiot.</p><p>So, after some lengthy debriefing with Leena, I finally managed to get back to Spring Lake to my car. I went out to breakfast with Gen, Missy, Adam, and Claire and we had the usual fun making fun of Missy. Padmini called and said she'd do the biking at the Greenway with me today. I was so into that, so once I got home, I suited up and biked my little toushie about 8 miles to her house. It was a very pleasant ride (though I was still hungover and very dizzy).</p><p>We had a nice chat at the Greenway. Poor Padmini had problems keeping up with me and she kept apologizing, but I told her it was ok. She's so cute, I told her if she started riding her bike to school, she be in so much shape. She just needs to get over the whole fear of cars. That's something I accomplished long ago. Your automobile doesn't scare me!</p><p>After I rode the whole 8 miles back to my house, I took a shower and got in a long nap. I wanted to finish this admittedly lengthy entry before midnight, but I guess that didn't work. I had a good time today and last night, so good for that. Expect more nostalgia this week probably. Graduation is Saturday, isn't that scary?</p><p>It will all be over soon. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Depressed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=39','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Who's Joe</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
