      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/redicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'm feeling very strange.  Who really cares about school anymore?  I mean, all you dedicated undergrads with one or two more years left to suffer through, I suppose I can understand that, but I'm so over it now.  I've secured my A in English, attended the Fink farewell, and I've studiously sent out my resume to several potential employers.<p>I sent one today to a paper in Pennsylvania, 90 minutes from New York and Boston.  I know, I know, it might not be glamorous, but I think it's close enough to civilization for me to tool around for about 2 years before I hit up a major metropolitan daily.  I won't mention the two jobs I applied for in NYC&#8212;they're long shots w/ big time publishers, but I know I can do the job.  I just hope all this good karma I have starts working its magic.  A Brandy face, any day now... </p><p>Other than all that, I have some editing to do before my portfolio is due tomorrow. I know I can do it, I just don't care very much about it. Like I said, I just don't care anymore. There's a final Friday. Afterward, Gen's going somewhere to pick up a puppy. I think I'll tag along. Friday night, it's the last Krush Girls, for me at least. I think I'm going to do it. I'm going to get all tipsy and cute and dance like the brave little toaster that I know I am, and I'm going to pretend everything is good again. Maybe, for one night, it will be enough just to pretend :-)</p><p>After that, <em>nothing!</em> A whole week before graduation and all I have to do is pester companies to pay me money in exchange for my valuable service. My mom is coming next week, so I think I'll have some stuff to do. My cousin and aunt are coming to see me graduate. I bought my cap and gown the other day to show off to them. Just so you know, it wasn't cheap! I had to buy two tassels because I didn't know which degree to tout&#8212;English or Journalism. I got two degrees, so I figure I deserve two tassels.</p><p>Monday night was the Red &amp; Black end of semester shindig at Taco Stand. I went, recalling awkward cast parties from that musical I did back in high school. I didn't &quot;belong&quot; there, I don't know many of the people. I knew enough to be welcome, at least. That's one thing I did this year that I should be really proud of. Ever since I was a freshman, I wanted to be on staff at the Red &amp; Black. I accomplished that this semester, and that's pretty cool. I wrote headlines, positioned some dueling mugs, and had my name published each and every day. How much does that rock!</p><p>Running goes well. I do it faster now, didn't you know? Well I do. Apparently, running shirtless doesn't tan me enough. Fuck it. If I have to be pale, I don't care. I tried.</p><p>Also, Marilia's birthday is today! Happy Birthday girl. I'm sending her a care package (don't worry, she knows cause I told her when she talked to me for an hour on Tuesday night). It will be a surprise. I hope it makes her happy.</p><p>I think I'll go to bed early and edit in the morning. Send me all your job wishes! I hope to settle that before I go to Europe. Then, all will be well.</p><p>Maybe I'll put up my poem tomorrow...if Padmini workshops it in time. Expect that very soon. Later. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Sick</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=38','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">BoA - <em>Every Heart</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
