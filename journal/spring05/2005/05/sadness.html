      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/lilypissedicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />A good friend of mine left today. He left to start his next great adventure.<p>Though it may not be begin on the streets of Washington D.C. or take him further  than the heights of some volcano in Sicily, it's still extremely special. Granted, it may not have the same eclectic allure as his host mom's cooking in St. Petersburg or dare the match the delicious pastries he once inhaled outside that little-known cathedral in New York City, but I wouldn't discount the outstanding opportunity of shopping at Trader Joe's for the next two years (or was that Farmer John's?) Regardless of what anyone might think, my friend Jeremy is about to head out into the real world and our friendship will never be the same again.</p><p>I know, that's kind of sad. I'm not that sad, though. I realize this is what needs to happen and I'm so glad that Jeremy is going someplace really exciting for the next two years. He's going to be working in Dayton, OH researching for the Kettering Foundation about democracy. Wow, I know, I'm<em> jealous</em>, but I guess Jeremy got to it first, right? I'm glad though because it means ever time I go to see my mom in the next two years, I will have a very good friend to see. I think that's pretty cool.</p><p>Well, before I toast to Jeremy's exciting future, I should say something about the past. Of all my friends this past year, Jeremy has truly been there for me when I needed it the most. It has been really rough, and while some people would walk away, Jeremy was always one to be by my side when I needed it. I can't begin to account for the several times this past year that I've frequented Jerm's apartment or accompanied him and Adam on an evening out to Athens for dinner. Some of the best memories of the last year involve Jerm in some way or another (along with another friend who will get her day in the spotlight sometime soon), and I am very thankful for every moment I have had to spend with him. Hands down, though, I must admit, the most useful think Jerm did for me this year was introduce me to the fabulousness that is and always will be <em>Showgirls</em>. Wow, I didn't know you had it in you, Jerm.</p><p>But now that's over. The last few weeks have been nice. Jerm's helped me out with the job search and beat off the encroaching summer boredom. Hopefully I helped to make his last few days in Athens somewhat special. I don't think it's going to be the same without someone like Jeremy around. It's kind of depressing, but I guess that's how it goes. This is almost over for me, as well, and soon I'll be getting to say my goodbyes. It's a shame Jeremy's had to come so soon.</p><p>But don't worry, Jerm. Though we may not always have Athens, we'll always have Dayton.</p><p>:-)</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Sad</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Tori Amos - <em>Starfucker</em></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
