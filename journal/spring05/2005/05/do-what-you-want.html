For a while now, I have been having a hard time accepting frequent disappointment.  Not from whom you'd expect, I should add, but just from people who I care for and you would think care as equally for me.  I feel like I'm a good person, that I am someone who listens and tries very earnestly to make happy the people I care about.  This week, for example, I sent packages to Marilia and April (of the pervasive Peace Corps fame) at significant expense to me.  I mean, I'm not even sure if they would have gone such lengths for me, but I didn't do it for that. I don't expect something in return.  I know they deserve something special and I did everything I could to make them happy&#8212;even if it cost too much.<p>I don't think anyone would do something that special for me&#8212;or anything special for me. I even make myself very clear to the people that are capable of doing the most trivial things to give me the smallest amount of satisfaction, and I am ignored. Instead of listening to me, though, they would rather think about themselves and, as a consequence, make me feel worthless. Shouldn't my graduation be special? Don't I deserve for my most simple requests to be fulfilled? Why must I try so hard for others when no one will try for me? I know it's not much, and though they seem trivial, the fact that you ignore them hurts me very much. I don't know why I should just accept that nobody gives a damn about me. It's not fair, and I won't take it anymore.</p><p>So no, I don't care that I'm graduating tomorrow. I don't care what I'm wearing, I could give a shit which tassel graces my cap. It doesn't matter to me because it obviously doesn't matter to anyone else. I believe that if it did matter, you would do something about it and I wouldn't feel like a burden and a fool. You would listen to me instead of treating me like shit.</p><p>Anyways, I told myself I would write something before the big day. I don't think I will even show up, honestly. Who's going to notice anyways? I never said I wanted to go. It's a pointless ceremony where you sit around and listen to a bunch of boring speeches until someone hands you a piece of paper that says you graduated, which you already know, and I just don't see the point in it all. Can you believe I was asked to go to more than one of these things? I can't handle this. I just want it to be over.</p><p>And the only thing I wanted to do more than anything else today was to run. And I didn't even get to do that.</p><p>So happy graduation my fellow students. You earned it.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Disappointed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=40','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Medication</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
