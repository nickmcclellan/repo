      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/sexisnottheenemyicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />It's been a little while, and maybe I missed this just a little bit.  So I came back.  Good for that.<p>Things have been really busy lately. Last Wednesday night, I made a very conscience decision. Padmini asked if I wanted to watch <em>Kung Fu Hustle</em> at the Georgia Theatre, and I really wanted to go. Before I headed down that way, though, I felt really guilty. I feel like, so far this summer, I've taken things too easy. I feel like I haven't sacrificed enough for what it is I'm trying to accomplish. I felt like I need to sacrifice Stephen Chow, if only for that night.</p><p>So I stayed in, and until about 2 in the morning, I worked on the framework of what would be my second website. No, don't get too excited, it's not my new personal webpage. That's going to take alot longer than 5 days to make. I started working on my professional website, a tool I intend to use for employers to see examples of my web design, page design, and writing. I bought a domain and webspace (finally!) and worked most of the day Thursday on tiding up the framework and creating my first functional Flash elements. The site was really impressive, but I had to put everything on hold for a most disturbing task. The <em>Terror</em>.</p><p>I agreed to watch Gen's puppy Kali this weekend while she went off to Michigan to see her cousin graduate. I'm probably overexaggerating, but puppy-sitting a 9 week-old yellow lab was really overwhelming. She came over on Thursday night and she was very fussy. It took forever to get her to go to the bathroom outside. Also, she didn't give me much time to work on my webpage. Friday morning, she woke me up at 7 a.m., so I took her outside and also took advantage of the morning (which I used to print 10 impressive resumes to send to 10 exotic locales, mostly in New York City and D.C.) The dog then proceeded to pee on my bed, my kitchen floor, and my rug. It was infuriating, as young and sweet-looking she is, I don't take shit from dogs (literally). It was a tough couple of days, but I think by Saturday, we had an understanding of eachother.</p><p>It was really hard getting anything done all weekend because of the responsibility of having a puppy. You would think it would be alot of fun playing with a cute puppy all day long, but it's really exhausting! She has teeth like razors and all she wants to do is bite my hands and I can only lose so much blood. And she couldn't play nicely by herself either! If I left her alone for five minutes, she'd find some random thing on the floor and start destroying it, mostly likely peeing somewhere in the process. It was a nightmare, and come Monday when Gen returned, I was ready to send her home.</p><p>Kali really liked me, though. Gen said that she's been so much more disciplined since returning home. Oddly enough, she tries to make it outside before peeing all over Gen's carpet. I wonder where she learned a trick like that (Note to puppies: Don't fuck with me!)</p><p>I am going to hang out with Leena tonight. She's going to Tokyo next week, I'm going to miss her! Everyone is leaving, I just can't wait til' it's my turn!</p><p>Also, in running related news, I have ran the last three days in a row! I'm so proud of myself. Also, I'm sporting a very nifty tan. Finally! Years of pale, pasty skin have come to an end.</p><p>Oh, and about the new website. I suppose you'd expect I'd post a link here, but I don't want to. There's information on it that, well, I'm not comfortably with any weirdo who finds this site first knowing. If you really want to see it, just send me an IM or e-mail, and I'll hook you up. I think I will be moving my site to my new domain by the end of the summer, so you can just wait until then to see it.</p><p>I just suggest you ask me for the address. It's worth seeing, very sexy design,  unlike anything you'd see here.</p><p>Tootles.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Exhausted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=45','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Snow Patrol - <em>Chocolate</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
