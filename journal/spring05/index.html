It's really over.<p>It's sad to say that this is my last Blog, but it really is. I have been doing this for so long, it's almost scary to think I'm not going to have a place to rant and be original. Blogging was the one thing that, despite my happiness or depression, I could always go and feel like myself again. For some reason, during my tenure here at UGA, having my own little log of events was somewhat of a comfort for me. I'm grateful that I found the energy and creativity to fuel a place like this.</p><p>But now I'm leaving it behind. I'm not getting a LiveJournal or anything like that, I'm just going away quietly. I don't think I see much reason to Blog any longer. I feel like the most exciting thing I can do now is to try my life off the radar, away from the assuming silence of this place. I can't tell you how much contempt I feel when I think of how many people I know (who supposidly love me and care about me) come here to see about me instead of speaking to me. I want to make it harder for them to keep tabs on me. I'm sick of being on the slab. I want to be free.</p><p>I feel, once I shead this, I truly can be. Something that has preoccupied my mind for so long&#8212;ever since I realized my Junior year that I had more time behind me than I had in front of me&#8212;is that one day I will have to leave. I knew then that Athens was not mine forever. It belonged to the underclassman and not to the graduates (unless you're lame enough to go to Grad school here or get a job). I knew that when my time came, I would have to find a new place to go so I could blaze a new trail.</p><p>That's what I wanted to find this summer, but that didn't happen. I'm going to Ohio so that I can keep looking, and though I once saw going here to be a solemn defeat, I don't feel that's completely true. I am leaving. I'm really getting out of this place and going far away to someplace that I have really never known before. Different people. Different circumstances. A whole new place to be me where I don't have to worry from what dark corner the past may come after me. For this, I am very excited.</p><p>I think so many people find safety in the places they've been before, but I don't want to meander. I want to go out and say at the end of the day that I took the big chances. Maybe that's why it's been harder for me. I know that's why I need more time, when I do find where I'm going, it will be very good. It will be worth it.</p><p>Oh, before my goodbyes, I must fulfill a Blogging icon tradition. I never had so many icons before, they truly were the best. Now they are all retired:</p><p align="center"><img src="spring05collage.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p><p>So, as I find myself reaching to bottom of the page, I just want to say thank you. Thanks for coming here, leaving comments, and reading my rants. Even if you hate me, there must be something here that keeps you coming back. Thanks for showing an interest.</p><p>I want to tell my friends that I love them and that I will miss them very much. I mean, you know I love you, I hate to make Friends Pages, and look how many I have! And those tribute Blogs are also a pain to write too. Reminiscence is exhausting, but I wouldn't have done it unless you were worth it.</p><p>I want to say that I truly will miss Athens. I know I have to leave, but I don't want to. I have had the time of my life here. I have fallen in love with your convoluted streets, classic atmosphere, and beautiful people. When I look back, the most memorable times I had  were when I was riding around town on my bike. I will miss the open air, the sunshine, and the many bike lanes. I really will.</p><p>And to everyone, I want to say that I will be back. I'm not sure when or for how long, but I promise I will be back. This place is too familiar and treasured for me to leave behind forever.</p><p>So that's it. Don't forget me, and if you want to find me, I'm not that hard to find.</p><p>Thanks again, and good-bye.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Free</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=34','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Happy Home</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 My Regret

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/kagomeregreticon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I have been promising this for months. I had planned on finishing it early this May, but my efforts to get someone to read the poem and comment on it went unacknowledged and unanswered. I'm sorry, I know that I am not the best poet in the world, but I try. Damnit, I went all the way up to Advanced Creative Writing and got an A, so I can't be that bad.<p>This is the last poem I am putting on my website.</p><p>The poem is called &quot;My Regret,&quot; and it is a continuation of the poem &quot;My Will,&quot; which I finished last year in May. I have been working on this poem since early February and in this time, it has truly become a living, breathing thing for me. The value I assign to this poem will probably only be wholly understood by me, but let me just say that finishing it is a great achievement for me. I am so happy to have to opportunity to share it with anyone who is interested in reading it.</p><p>Just so you know how it has come about, it all started one afternoon on the Athens bus. I knew I wanted to continue &quot;My Will,&quot; but I was uncertain what images I could use. All that came up into me were accusations and answers to questions I never heard asked: &quot;You think I'm crazy,&quot; I remember, were the first words that spawned the poem. As you can imagine, the poem surged in so many different directions from there.</p><p>As I mentioned, the poem is a continuation of &quot;My Will,&quot; which was inspired partly by the anime <em>Inuyasha</em>. In it, there is a love triangle between Inuyasha, a dead priestess Kikyo, and her reincarnation, a young girl named Kagome. You see, Inuyasha and Kikyo are lovers who are duped by a duplicitous demon into believing that they have betrayed eachother. In the ensuing duel, Kikyo losses her life, but is later resurrected. Her only hold on the living world is the intense hatred she felt for Inuyasha before her death&#8212;a hatred she is incapable of letting go of.</p><p>In the poem &quot;My Will,&quot; Inuyasha recounts his relationship with Kikyo and his frustrations over why she would ever think that he would have betrayed her. He is wounded in their fight, but recovers (as is revealed in &quot;My Regret,&quot; by the care of Kagome). He is shocked to find, years after her death, she has returned to him. She wants to be with Inuyasha. She wants to take him with her back to hell.</p><p>In the final line of the poem, as it seems obvious that Inuyasha should just let Kikyo die, he says to the absent figure, Kagome, &quot;Forgive my will, Kagome / You never had me,&quot; revealing that his love for Kikyo is indeed important enough for him to die for. In my poem &quot;My Regret,&quot; I explore Kagome's response to Inuyasha's choice.</p><p>If you know anything about me, you should know this poem has less to do with Inuyasha and more to do with the issues I have been dealing with in the past six months. You can see alot of that in this poem, and though I use the story as a source of inspiration and imagery, the act could have very well have happened to me&#8212;or anyone. The story is just a tool I manipulate to communicate my emotion, if that makes any sense.</p><p>Writing this poem was very important to me. I wanted to make something beautiful and enduring out of the misery and pain I felt after&#8212;well, after Matt left. It's not something unique to me, as many of my other poems have been. I imagine anyone who has had to experience someone they love leave them and not understand why will probably recognize the emotions of this poem.</p><p>Now that I have finished it, I am grateful that I took my time. &quot;Separation&quot; evolved under similar circumstances to this one, but so much more quickly. It was inspired by a  difficult &quot;situation,&quot; and though I still feel the poem has power and value, it is sloppy, unfocused, and almost entirely unrecognizable to anyone but me. &quot;My Regret,&quot; on the other hand, has changed from a string of personal questions and flashes of images into a woman's fevered hallucination aboard a crowded subway train. It's good, I don't need anyone to tell me it's good, I know it's good.</p><p>So, enough of this. I wrote it for Matt, just like I wrote &quot;My Will&quot; for Matt, because I feel emotion is not something you should keep inside. It is not something you let out in silently in dark corners. In this instance, the strong emotion I felt has become an enduring, beautiful thing that will live on and hopefully affect the lives of others. I hope that, if he does read it, he understands.</p><blockquote><i>This was your will<br>your fevered glance<br><br>And this is my regret.</i></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Translucent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=11','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Regret</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

There hasn't been one person who has been there for me more than my friend Genevieve.</p><p>We've been through alot together. Ever since I started my strange kick of running last Spring, no one has been there more than Genevieve to help get me past the fifth mile (well, maybe the second mile, but her leg hurt). She's always been there to give me a boost, whether it was moments when I feel like I'm losing my mind or even when I needed someone to help drive my car up to Ohio, she's always been getting me there.</p><p>This semester, Gen even leant me her bike to ride since I was worried that my K-mart P.O.S.'s wheel was about to fall off. I couldn't have done all that I did without her help. She was there for me when I had a very startling breakdown last January. She was the first person I called. God, she's even going to be there for me tomorrow, driving behind me as I take my things to Ohio and away from here. I don't think I've had a friend who has ever been so selfless.</p><p>I've given her things too, though. Mostly tofu, milkshakes, and aggrivation, though. We've had alot of fun this last semester, tofu burritos aside. One night, there was some late night swimming at her new apartment. Maybe I should have talked less about dietary stuff, though, but I like to look fondly on moments like that between us. Not alot of people try to get Gen, but I do. She's always been my best friend and she always will be.</p><p>That's what sucks about leaving. I really want to, you have no idea, but not because of Genevieve. God, I would stay just to be with someone like her. If I could take the good things with me, she would be at the top of my list (which is probably why she's coming along for the ride).</p><p>Just so you know, this is not the end for us. I forsee the two of us on some beach in Florida, steps from our back porch, walking with Kali thinking about days like this. Yup, together again, you will see.</p><p>So yah, I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss watching movies with beautiful women with her. I'm going to miss trips to Barberitos. And yes, I'm going to miss that terrible dog too.</p><p>It's a good thing I'm taking her with me. I've got a nice spot saved in my room where I can keep her ;-)</p><p>So I will never let her go.

	 117 Highland Park Dr.
	 
    </h3>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/rainbowinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />After a muted sigh in my upstairs hallway, I say to myself, &quot;This is it.&quot; I take one last jog down the stairs. Everything's packed. I've left nothing behind (except for a few lucky dust bunnies). Tonight, I leave my precious home behind.<p>I have to leave a tribute for this place. I've lived her for the past 2 years, for better or for worse, and it has become my one true home. While most of you have homes away from home, family members with whom you can stay with, I don't. Well, I do, but very far from here. Highland Park has been a comfort for me and a haven. I am thankful to have had such a wonderful time here.</p><p>When I think of my house, I remember the day I moved in. It was a crazy day. My sister had ditched me the night before, saying she would not help me move stuff with her car. Because of this, I had to borrow my aunt's van and make 2 trips to Athens myself. On the first trip, with the box spring of my bed strapped dangerously loose to the roof of the van, I listened to the radio with hopes of some musical goodness. To my delight, something truly special happened.</p><p>I should preface this. There are moments in my life when I am happy or sad, and sometimes these moments can be enriched by the presence of a song. In this moment, I was sublimely excited and anxious to finish moving things. It was at this very time, on the 99X RetroPlex, they played The Cure's &quot;Pictures of You,&quot; which I had grown very fond of over the summer. I don't think I ever belted out a song with such vigor in my whole life, it was a true joy. That was the beginning of my experience at Highland Park Dr.</p><p>My house became the antithesis of what dorm life was for me. I lived with people I knew and loved (or put up with, in the case of Milo). Also, my house played a significant role in my relationship with Matt, as he was unwilling to have me at his place and my space was alot bigger. When the two of us lost our cars, it also became often our only place to go. In these days, I think I enjoyed the house the most. It was boring, but it was a place I loved being with him. It was good then.</p><p>There were of course the parties. All two of them, both ending up with visits from the cops. Granted, I argued the one ticket down in court, but I could not risk having that many people over again. Oh, but they were good parties. Keg stands, body shots, and who can forget the orgy in Milo's room? I know I can't.</p><p>This year, though, things were different. I had 2 new roommates who were nothing like Marilia. Don't get me wrong, I think David was my favorite roommate ever. He was responsible, clean, and a good friend. I wish Marilia had stuck around, the three of us would have had an amazing time. Anyways, the place just got colder. Jennifer, my other new roommate, was always very standoffish, and the three of us never found a way to make it fun like the previous year.</p><p>And things got depressing. I began to see my house more and more as a prison than a haven. It was almost haunted with memories of the past&#8212;memories I wish I could push away. As my time at Highland Park dwindled, I became anxious for what was next.</p><p>Now that I'm leaving&#8212;now that the walls are painted, the floor is vacuumed, and my posters are off the wall&#8212;I feel sad. I see myself, in a year maybe, driving up to this place and remembering the good times and bad times with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. It was my space, away from everything. It wasn't glamorous or even great location-wise, but it was mine.</p><p>And God, I will miss it.</p><p align="center"><img src="highland.jpg" width="350" height="261"></p><p>So, to my Athens home (pictured above during the big ice storm this past January), I say thank-you. I hope your next tenants love you as much as I did.</p><p>Oh, and sorry we fucked up the linoleum :-(</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Home</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=60','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Pictures of You</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
