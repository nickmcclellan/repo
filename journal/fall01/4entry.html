<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I had a nice time on Friday night.  Myself, Greg, and his friend Missy went out to dinner and then enjoyed a concert.  I had a really good time at the concert.  Greg told me before we left for dinner that he and I would act straight because Missy did not know he was gay.  I thought that was kinda cheap of him.  He would show off to Missy and kinda leave me to the side.  It was like if he talked to me more, he would have somehow let Missy know he was gay.  I think its really sad. I resolved last year that I would come into college letting everyone know I was gay, and thanks to Greg, I have.  He's really helped me come to comfort with my sexuality.  However, I really don't think it's necessarily Greg that helped me.  I think it was more the fact that he destoyed in my mind the stereotype of <i>that other guy</i>.  He demonstrated to me (so far) that not all guys are going to hurt me.</p>
<p>It's very hard not to be attracted to Greg.  Accompanying this attraction is a wishful fart of myself that thinks he's attracted to me.  It's either my complete inexperience with guys or the possibility that I may be right about Greg that makes me think he's coming on to me.  I went to his room Friday and it SEEMED like he wanted something to happen, but I am way too innocent to act on it.</p>
<p>At the concert, Greg noticed a really cool guy that he thought was checking him out.  He suggested that me and him go talk to him.  I was intrigued by the suggestion, so I did it; he chickened out.  I think his name was Ilya, but I really don't know.  Anyways, the four of us went back to Greg's room to hang out.  I felt like a fool.  I admitted that I liked cartoons like Captain Planet and Rugrats when I was little and I got a rude reaction.  I felt like I was being teased, which really pissed me off.  Who gives a damn what the hell I watched when I was a kid; I WAS A KID!  I'm not sure if it was Greg still trying to treat me bad in order to make Missy think he was straight or if he was bored with me and wanted to impress the new guy.  Either way, it didn't make me feel well.  I'm resolving to be Greg's friend right now, no matter what that may entail.  It would be nice to be more than friends, but I'll just have to see what happens.</p>
<p>I saw April this weekend and was really disappointed.  I thought her and I would spend the afternoon together on what may very well be my last weeking seeing her for a long time.  She took me on a BORING afternoon shoe shopping with her mom; it was awful.  I'm not sure what her problem was.  I think that she's so into Matt that she's leaving me on the curb.  It's really mean of her, but I figure she'll somehow get over it, hopefully.  I think I need to grow away from my "fag hag"'s anyways.  It's not healthy.</p>
<blockquote><i>You'll have to excuse me, I was obviously being a complete prick to April.  Adjusting to her relationship was very hard for me.  In fact, in case you didn't know, alot of the emotions that brought about me creating my website "Thursday" came from the difficulties I had in the changing relationship between April and I.  If I continue to bad mouth April, please realize that I no longer feel this way and deeply regret any ill will I had toward her.  I love her alot, and wouldn't trade her for anything...no matter if she has the personality of a door knob.<br>
<br>
So, Missy.  Big news!  She came in so innocuously, and turned out to be the most important thing to happen to me during my entire college career.  Our mutual interest in Greg worked well to bring us together.  Her sweet loyalty to me as a friend was also a help.  We'll certainly be hearing more from her.<br>
<br>
And Ilya?!  Yah, I met him in the fall too.  That crazy guy...</i>
