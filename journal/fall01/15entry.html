<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I met Jason on December 10th at 12:59 a.m.  I talked to him for five hours.  It was amazing.  I'm so amazed someone like that has come around.  It's like instant love, almost.  It's like, so hopeful for me.  He's so incredible and down to earth.  I just know he can do all sorts of good for me.</p>
<p>He is afraid I'm lying to him.  I told him I would never do that.  I guess he must really doubt that a real genuine guy could like him.  I'm a little amazed myself.  He seems like the prefect guy. He's perfect because he's not perfect.</p>
<p>If there is anything I don't want, it's another <i>him</i>.  Someone that looks so fine, but is such a selfish human being.  I want a friend.  Someone that could hold me tenderly when I feel scared.  Someone that can chase the darkness away.  If life is perfect, Jason could do that.</p>
<p>I haven't talked to him today and I really want to.  I'm fearful this will fall apart.  Everything good usually does.  Things are clouded with confusion, hopeless and down.  Why would Jason be different then anyone else?</p>
<p>I ask if he wanted to do dinner and a movie.  He wants Mexican food.  I'm so looking forward to that little date.  I decided today that we should go as friends, tow guys sharing a mild interest.  If there is some kind of spark, I anticipate a relationship.</p>
<p>Things about Jason:  he draws, he likes boys, he went to prom with the prom king.  He doesn't like rap music much.  He loves his ex Michael.  He likes Buffy kinda like I do.  He had his first relationship at 19.  His longest relationship was 6 months.  He went out with the guy that looks like my uncle.  He says he's a good kisser.  He says I'm sexy.  He has issues about how gay guys percieve relationships.  He has a website called qbcam.com.  HE LIKES ME!  He likes Savage Garden.  His best friend's name is Kevin.  He draws naughty Santa pictures.  Nick likes him!</p>
<p>Things about Me:  I write.  I like boys.  I went to prom with Alexis Gaddy.  I don't like rap music very much, but I adore Lauren Hill.  I LOVE Buffy.  I'm hoping that I have my first relationship at 19.  My longest relationship was 2 days.  I would NEVER go out with the guy that looks like my uncle.  I want to be a good kisser.  I think he's sexy.  I had a Tamagotchi website.  I LIKE HIM!  I LOVE GARBAGE!  My best friend's name is April Smith.  I write about the Asian-American concept of invisibility...and Jason likes me!</p>
<p>Still I wait...</p>
<blockquote><i>Ok, at last!  Some real action.<br>
<br>
I met Jason online from the XY personals.  He IMed me, we got to talking, and I fell really hard for him.  You see, this was the weekend between final exams, and there was a band in Athens that this guy I knew from Target was in, and I wanted to go see them.  Missy and Genevieve were too busy STUDYING, so they wouldn't go with me >:o  This left me to my own devices, which had me on the internet looking for love, and I thought I had found it.<br>
<br>
Yah, Jason was a really cool guy.  We really hit it off, but what was originally told to me as only 30 minutes from the Target I worked out, turned out to be about an hour a way and what seemed like a half a tank of gas.  He was very far away from my house in Marietta.  He was SO far away from Athens.  He didn't have a car and he lived with his mom.  The good thing about all this was he was so far way from everything, going to see him was a real comfort.  I really enjoyed the time I spent with him at his house (even though it smelled).<br>
<br>
Basically, I had no problem with the boyfriend issues after my relationship with Jason, because I had been there and done that AT LAST!  In the first week or so back in the Spring of 2002, I realized the distance really was an issue, and that was the end of that.  After that, I talked to him a few times now and then, but have really not kept in touch with him well.  He was a good guy, and I'm really glad he was my first boyfriend.  He was decent, and he was really cute.  I am really lucky to have had a chance with a guy like him.<br>
<br>
Well, Jason is perhaps the big papa of my website--he's the one responsible for giving me FrontPage, which I used to make the first incarnation of my website.  Thanks to him, I had quite an addictive habit.  And yes...he was a good kisser, and probably because of him.  So am I.<br>
<br>
Well, this is the penultimate page!  Sadness...it's all over now.  You better keep reading though, just one more left!</i>
