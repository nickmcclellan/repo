<h2 class="date-header">On a day that the world changes, you can't help but ride the wave</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I will briefly reflect on the issues of the day; odd, because I rarely write about world issues.</p>
<p>What happened today is so horrible, I just can't believe it. Why would any human being want to cause as much destruction and death that has occured several times todays. It makes me physically sick I could not help but think about the thousands of people that have died, are dying, and will die today and throughout the week. We, as a nation, need to join hands and help save as many lives as possible. I believe that pointing the finger at the phase is unwise, especially in a situation that involves terrorism. Accusing people now that may be innocent may cause additionaly unncessary loss of life.</p>
<p>Once again, I can't help but ask WHY? I can not answer this. I believe that this situation was preventable. This exposes a serious vulnerability in American national security, and that is pathetic. Today, the world's most powerful nation fell to the knees of terrorists, and this is INEXCUSABLE. Surely someone with U.S. Intelligence or the CIA was capable of stopping this situation, either through heightened vigiliance or through rapid retaliation.</p>
<p>There was 18 minutes between the two World Trade Center crashes, SURELY <b>SOMEONE</b> could see this second plane approaching New York in an unexplained course. How can there be 4 <b>SUCCESSFUL</b> airplane hijackings in one day when there hasn't been even one since 1991. Someone <b>FUCKED</b> up today, and thus the U.S., and the world, will never be the same again.</p>
<blockquote><i>Yah, I made a big stink about this when it happened. I guess I should start from the beginning. You should too...think about it. Where were you on September 11th?<br>
<br>
When the first plane hit, I was in my 8 a.m. Spanish class. I left from there and went to Bolton for some breakfast. I had my earphones on, so I ate my food alone, listening to garbage. On the way back to Russell, I ran into Greg, said hello, probably felt bad that I ate breakfast so fast that I couldn't eat with him. When I walked into the lobby of Russell, I knew something was wrong.
<br>
Everyone was watching the Bloomberg channel. All I saw was that the New York Stock Exchange had been closed for the day. I figured that, since a recession was coming, it must have hit harder than anyone had expected, and the stock market had just crashed. I continued to the elevators, still listening to my music, feeling like the day was just a little bit more interesting. When I walked into my dorm room, I immediately turned on CNN to get the scoop.<br>
<br>
I saw the first tower on fire. I was shocked, at first I thought it was an accident. I called April several times, wondering if she knew what was going on. I don't remember if I saw the second plane hit the tower, it may have already happened when I got to my room, I don't remember. I was talking to April on the phone, telling her how these towers would be rebuilt, and that was what America did after tragedy--rebuild. It was then when the first tower fell, and I felt the weight of that day. I was glued to the set for most of the day until my roommate came back. After a while, we decided to go give blood, but I eventually decided I wouldn't, so I went to my room to take a nap.<br>
<br>
When I woke up, I got a call from Greg who invited me to go to Snelling with him, Missy, and John. It was the first time I ever went to Snelling, actually. When we were there, he and I got into an argument about the day. He felt like what happened couldn't have been prevented. I obviously felt differently. We kind of left on bad terms. When I got back to my room, I wrote what I have rewritten above and I sent it to my friends and family--including Greg. He responded, disagreeing again, and that was that. My friendship with Greg began to unravel.<br>
<br>
Though he and I still had probably one more good night together--the best night to come--I consider this day to be the end of that friendship. He, for some reason, couldn't respect my opinion. Now almost three years later, I feel more right then ever. With the 9/11 Commission determining that the Pentagon should have acted faster on that fateful day, I know that I was the one who had a level head that day. Unlike some people, I believe our government should be accountable for its discrepancies. Maybe Greg felt differently.<br>
<br>
After this horrible day, I began to move farther away from alot of people. Fortunately, I had such good friends to fill the absense of others. Thank God for Missy.</i>
