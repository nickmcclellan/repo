<h2 class="date-header">The Who's Who of my first semester at UGA</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><u>Leena</u></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure she's the coolest person I've met; but I can't completely say because Greg is pretty cool.  I like to talk to her a bunch.  I really want to get her out of the core of gay guys that have swallowed her up.  I think that she's finding some interesting str8 guys thought...</p>
<p><u>Dille</u></p>
<p>She is really cool.  I still need to know her more though.  Very pretty as well.</p>
<p><u>Missy</u></p>
<p>She was a bit upset when she found out that I didn't write about her.  I figure that she's just a clear cut, nice girl.  I think she's more meaningful to Greg though.  She's Catholic, and Greg endured tons of Catholic teaching.  He hasn't said anything to her about being gay.  She really doesn't really appreciate that he has to hide this from her.  I told her that I was gay, and she was really cool about it.  I think she's very sweet and grounded; and a VERY funny drunk!</p>
<p><u>Greg</u></p>
<p>Yes, the big one.  I'll start off being negative.  He's such an impatient person, and he's so lanky and pale!  He conforms to stereotypes and is deeply stupid about alot of stuff.  He lies too and doesn't know when he's gone too far.</p>
<p>The positive, he's very nice, accepting of people (until he's bored with them).  He's so nice and alot of fun.  I don't really have alot of nice things to say about him because I'm beginning to realize he's not as cool as I had originally hoped he would be.  I wish I had a gay friend that was more "one-on-one" with me.  Maybe its that I want some sort of romance too, I just don't know.</p>
<blockquote><i>Wow, everything is Greg-centric!  How annoying.  At least Missy got the bulk of my praise...sort of.  Like I mentioned earlier, her loyalty to her friends was extraordinary.  It was one of the reasons that it was so easy for me to embrace her instead of Greg once things got really tough (as they will in the next few entries).</i>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Overall, I'm feeling alot better now (sadly).  I'm getting over Greg.  One one hand, he's not such an interesting guy, but on the other, I like being into people.  FORTUNATLY, that is also happening.</p>
<p>The one guy I think I'm into is really cute.  His name is Aiman.  I met him at Boneshakers when I did the bad dancing with Sean.  The Saudi-Arabian guy, remember?  I think he's interesting in me, but I just don't know for sure.  It would be so cool to be in a relationship, I would love it!  If I see him on Friday, I thinking about exchanging phone numbers.  Hehe...at least he's cuter than John!  Oh, I take that back, John is an amazing guy, just not date material at all.  He's an authority figure, it just seems weird.</p>
<p>There is this other guy Justin, he's very cute, but he's not very interesting.  He's all into the hook-up, and I want to get to know a guy before I'm really intimate.  He said, with me being the only gay guy at the table, that he wanted a b/f.  I'm probably being assuming, but I would be ok to date him...I want to date someone!  He also touched me while I was dancing, that was odd.  Everything he's done to me hasn't been really obvious, but it's fun to think he's interested in me.  And on the way home, he sat in the front seat and put his hands around my chair.  Oh, and we went back to his room, he got completly naked while we were in there...I got to see his ass!  It looked ok, I must say.</p>
<p>I kinda wish I could go to this rave tomorrow, but I think we're going to end up at Boneshakers again.  Maybe I'll get to talk to Aiman...yeah!</p>
<blockquote><i>Ok, Aiman rears his then attractive head again.  Yes, once again, it's true, I had a crush on Aiman, so shoot me!  He's a cute guy, I was a freshman, I knew nothing of obnoxious drunk Aiman, and honestly, I'd fuck anyone back then, I was a lame stupid freshman, everything was new.  Just want to share something I wrote about a year later when I actually dated Aiman:<br>
<br>
"I've been feeling confliced.  I like being with Aiman, but I feel like I am settling down when I want to meet some more people and experience other relationships."<br>
<br>
It's just never a good idea to start dating in the Fall.  There are so many things flying into your young Sophomore eyes, it's hard to focus on one person for more than a few weeks.  I had really put my Freshman year feelings for Aiman aside, it was over for me.  Because I had a second opportunity in the Fall of 2002, I decided to give it a shot--I liked him before, I could like him again.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, it didn't work, and I had to end it.  Live and learn, huh?  It doesn't feel good hurting someone--just like it doesn't feel good getting burned by someone else.  Fortunate for me, I took in everything I dished out that year.  Yey experience!<br>
<br>
Things seem so good at this point, but change is always around the corner.  On the day that tested the will of America, my relationships at UGA were strained as they took on the ultimate test...</i>
