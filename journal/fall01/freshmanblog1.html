<p>It's difficult to think of any one thing to say about my freshman year.  Everyone's experience is different.  I suppose that well all experience many of the same things, though.  We all show up here, thinking we're blazing a brave, new trail.  We think we're so beautiful and interesting.  Unfortunately, we have no idea how ordinary we all really are.  Just a new bunch of snotty horny freshman, nothing special here.<br>
<br>
But, to think that characterizes everything we little freshman do would be very wrong.  Despite feeling alittle overexposed and embarrassed when I look back, there were alot of things about my freshman year that were truly special.  I made that most enduring group of friend.  I wouldn't give any of them up for the world.  I witnessed alot of firsts during my freshman year.  My <a href="12entry.html" target="_blank">first kiss</a>.  My <a href="15entry.html" target="_blank">first boyfriend</a>.  My <a href="../springbreak/springbreak2002.html" target="_blank">first Spring Break</a> with a huge blow-up fight.  And, of course, my <a href="16entry.html" target="_blank">first</a> <a href="../spring02/1-27journal.html" target="_blank">website</a>.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't say that my freshman year was the best year ever.  It wasn't the worst, thankfully.  There were a few things that needed some improvement.  I needed to do alot of growing up, and alot of that happened during this time.<br>
<br>
So, like all good stories, this one starts where it should.  The beginning.<br>
<br>
<strong>Welcome to Athens, GA </strong><br>
<br>
I started the year being dumped on the side of the road by my father.  My parents came up, helped me move my stuff into my dorm (I lived in Russell Hall), and after my father gave me a useless lecture about not losing my HOPE scholarship, he left me behind.  It's a humbling experience, being on your own for the first time in your life.  One day, after I had gone to Target to get some school supplies, I remember driving home and thinking, "It's just me, now."  No one was there for me except myself.<br>
<br>
One night, I was sitting in my room in Russell Hall with my roommate Matt.  Our door was open, and this guy was walking by with some friends.  I remember looking out at him.  I had a feeling he was gay, and I envied him.  He was laughing, with friends, probably off somewhere to have a good time.  In the few days I had been at school, I hadn't made any new friends.  I wanted to get out of my four-wall prison cell so I could start making my own friends.<br>
<br>
Going to college, I had resolved that I would start the whole experience being out of the closet.  It was a new thing for me, but I figured with all the new people I was meeting, I could simply tell them from the get go that I was gay, that way it wouldn't get weird.  Of course, I'd have to meet some friends before that could happen.<br>
<br>
I met <a href="2entry.html" target="_blank">Greg</a> through an XY personal online.  We went out to <a href="3entry.html" target="_blank">Blue Sky</a> one night to meet.  It turned out he was from New York, and he seemed very nice.  Through the course of the first few weeks, I met all of my good friends through Greg.  In this respect, he was a very valuable asset to me.  In others, though, he was really worthless.<br>
<br>
I guess I wasn't enough for him.  Greg had already had alot of eye-opening experiences back in New York, and I was no match for that.  Greg was into alot of drugs, and I couldn't keep up.  I did have a <a href="9entry.html" target="_blank">crush</a> on him, but it wasn't meant to be.  After taking probably more than I should have, I eventually <a href="10entry.html" target="_blank">gave up</a> on my friendship with Greg&#8212;my first gay friend.<br>
<br>
It was for the best, though.  Greg ended up taking too many drugs, failed out of school, and left before our sophomore year.  The last time I remember seeing him was when he was walking up the back stairwell in Russell Hall through the study lounge to get up to a friends room.  I was in the lounge studying.  I think about him sometimes and wonder whatever happened to him.  Fortunately for me, I had better friends than him.<br>
<br>
<strong>Friends</strong><br>
<br>
<a href="4entry.html" target="_blank">Missy</a> and Genevieve were the most remarkable two friends I met that year.  While our friendship has changed in four years, its remarkable that we all still somehow resemble the close-knit friendship we had back during our freshman year.  Greg introduced me to Missy when we went out to a concert for Dawgs After Dark.  Missy introduced me to Genevieve one day at Bolton.  Since then, the three of us hung out most weekends, and accompanied eachother out to the dining halls for dinner.  We spent alot of time together during that first year&#8212;maybe too much time.<br>
<br>
I met alot of other great friends that year too.  There was <a href="7entry.html" target="_blank">Leena</a>, <a href="7entry.html" target="_blank">Dille</a>, Vicki, Rachel, John, and Allyson.  It's funny how they all stuck around, and through four years, though our relationships may not be as close as they once were, they are still there.  I have kept in touch with each of them, and probably more importantly, they all have a permanent place on my Friends Page.<br>
<br>
In the early days, we all seemed to frequent Tasty World.  That was one of my first experiences with alcohol and all that jazz.  I didn't drink any, though.  It was kind of funny how I stayed away from it for so long (I didn't start drinking until my 19th birthday).  After Greg and I had established that we lacked the necessary straight cred to stick around a place like Tasty World, we started hanging out more at Boneshakers.<br>
<br>
That was alot of fun.  In those days, it seemed so much more innocent than it does now.  Less drugs.  I mean, there was karaoke!  The first song I ever did was "Stupid Girl," and it was really bad.  I think someone may have booed.  Wednesday nights were the most popular&#8212;no cover night.  I had my <a href="12entry.html" target="_blank">first kiss</a> on one of those nights.  Nothing to write home about, trust me.<br>
<br>
<strong>The First "Thursday"</strong><br>
<br>
After I got back from Christmas break (where I met this guy Jason, who turned out to be <a href="15entry.html" target="_blank">my first boyfriend</a>), I was kind of bored.  I was alittle depressed about my friendship with my best friend, April, from high school.  She had changed alot, and she didn't care to hang out with me as much as she did her boyfriend, Matt.  That's how the site <a href="16entry.html" target="_blank">came to be</a>.  Maybe an attempt to distinguish myself from the absence she seemed to force upon me.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you may notice, but my <a href="../spring02/1-27journal.html" target="_blank">first incarnation</a> of my website had alot of influence from the new garbage album at the time, Beautifulgarbage.  The whole website had the beloved garbage theme.  Listening to that record reminds me so much of my freshman year&#8212;walking back to my dorm after getting an A on my English paper, driving downtown on a Friday night, or running a horrendous 5 miles on the track with Missy.  All of it was on that record<br>
<br>
The Internet Journal wasn't supposed to be the thrust of the website, at first.  It's funny how it became that though.  My <a href="../spring02/1-27journal.html" target="_blank">first internet journal</a> wasn't very interesting.  It's alot of fun to look back on, but nothing really started to happen until <a href="../springbreak/springbreak2002.html" target="_blank">Spring Break.</a><br>
<br>
That year, Gen, Missy, and I went on a road trip.  We went to Destin, and we all had our own sinister plans.  Missy wanted to go clubbing and hook up with a guy.  Genevieve wanted to sit on the beach, have a beer, and relax.  I wanted to swim, each Cocoa Krispies, and just be a goof ball.  Needless to say, when I spilt my cereal all over the floor and refused to clean it up before the maids got to it, things went from bad to worse.  The three of us <a href="../spring02/3-24journal.html" target="_blank">didn't talk</a> for about a week after that rough trip.<br>
<br>
We did get back together, though.  One night, we all got <a href="../spring02/3-31journal.html" target="_blank">drunk</a> and went out to Boneshakers.  Missy was too drunk to make it though, and we went home.  I went to bed, but woke up to a very disgusting sight.  I woke up covered in vomit!  It was so disgusting, and while I was on my way to Wal-Mart to get some carpet cleaner to clean it up, I got pulled over and got my first speeding ticket!  It was an awful day, and I blew my whole tax check on that awful weekend.<br>
<br>
After that, the year started winding down.  We all got on eachother's nerves, and I think we all needed a good summer break.  There was, of course, some <a href="../spring02/4-7journal.html" target="_blank">journal</a> <a href="../spring02/4-21journal.html" target="_blank">drama</a>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Running Away</strong><br>
<br>
I left Athens feeling like I had to run away.  Things had gotten so complicated, and my friendship with Missy and Gen had become far too <a href="../spring02/4-28journal.html" target="_blank">co-dependent</a>.  That summer I work at Target (had some issues with this <a href="../spring02/7-21journal.html" target="_blank">major</a> <a href="../spring02/7-28journal.html" target="_blank">bitch</a>).  It was boring, as usual.  One of the most annoying things that happened was my racking up of substantial credit card debt for the first time when my car went kaput after I had fixed it, very studiously.  It was truly the <a href="../spring02/weekofhell.html" target="_blank">week from hell</a>.  But, as the summer dragged on, I patched up some things with April, did some hiking with Nicole, and I even tried my hand at some <a href="../spring02/7-14journal.html" target="_blank">internet dating</a>.  But that, per usual, fizzled.<br>
<br>
Something interesting to note: I got to <a href="../spring02/summerbreak.html" target="_blank">hang out</a> with my cousin, Laura, a whole bunch.  We went camping in Tennessee.  We ate a whole bunch of ice cream cake.  We talked about anal sex (don't ask).  We even did this really horrible <a href="../spring02/6-9journal.html" target="_blank">9 mile canoe trip</a> down some river when we went camping in Tennessee.  I don't think I'll ever live down taking my sister and cousin on that one.  It was alot of fun seeing so much more of Laura.<br>
<br>
At the dawn of my sophomore year, I started to make an important <a href="../spring02/7-7journal.html" target="_blank">resolution</a>.  I wanted to be more involved.  I wanted to meet more people and distinguish myself outside of my friendship with <a href="../spring02/7-14journal.html" target="_blank">Missy</a> and Genevieve.  I wanted to go to Lambda more, and maybe be a better friend to someone who was very nice to me&#8212;John.  At the end of that summer, I couldn't wait to start again.<br>
<br>
And with that, my freshman year was over.  I was alittle more mature than the sniffling' brat that first walked through the halls of Russell Hall.  Though I had grown alot, nothing could prepare me for what was coming the next year&#8212;the best year.
