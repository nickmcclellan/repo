Afghanistan is going to get their asses kicked.<br>
Over 3,000 people died two weeks ago, and all I can think about is kissing boys.<br>

Dille is a sweetie pie.<br>
Matt isn't as attractive to me anymore.<br>
Brad is very friendly.<br>
April's a fucking loser that's too damn scared to walk outside her loser dorm room and stop giving her loser b/f hand jobs to go outside and breath the fresh air of freedom and expand her horizons and run free from her parents and try something new and realize that sometimes it doesn't matter that you go to a college where the majority of guys don't have sex, they masturbate.<br>
I'm really smart, but I'm still bored.</p>
<blockquote><i>Like, well, basically all my entries, you must excuse this one too.  First, I'm NOT that smart, and realizing that took a while.  Freshman are never smart.<br>
<br>
Second, I love April.  Who cares if she didn't go out and get drunk and do more her freshman year.  She had Matt, and she had a blast giving him hand jobs, and that's OK!<br>
<br>
Third...well, I dunno.  I edited alot of this because it's one of the most stinky entries in my journal, so all of this I figured could be published without too much of a damaging effect on my reputation.  Well, it's interesting, and the multitude of one-liners really capture what was going through my mind in the Fall of 2001.  You know, more than just boys and Greg.</i>
