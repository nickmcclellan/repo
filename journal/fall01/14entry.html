<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>It seems that September 11, 2001 was a great turning point for me.  It  was the day I stood up to Greg and all he stood for.  It was also the day I first anticipated the new garbage album would be released.  I actually decided this week to burn the bridge between me and Greg.  I'd heard from Ilya on Wednesday that Greg said I was annoying.  That did it for me.  That was the last straw.</p>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm slowly achieving my ultimate goal against Greg.  I'm taking the people he's recklessly thrown aside and started to build a network of friends.  As mean as it sounds, I've assimilated John, Brad, Ilya, Leena, Sara, Missy, and others int my anti-Greg group.  HE HE HE...I'm going to tear is world apart!</p>
<blockquote><i>It's incredible how evil I was when I was a freshman.  I admit now that more then anything I was jealous of Greg.  He was confident and he was able to approach people and befriend them very easily, and I wished then that I could have these qualities as well.<br>
<br>
And I really didn't "assimilate" all those people into a group.  It was really just Missy that I got to my side.  Everyone else came to their own realization that Greg was an idiot, I had nothing to do with it.  I sure took the credit though...</i></blockquote>

I've achieved what I set out to do:  I have an amazing set of friends, and I have no desire to be his friend.  I'm going to try to never mention him again, he's that worthless.</p>
<blockquote><i>HORRAY!  No more mentioning Greg!  Wow!  I'm so shocked, amazed...<br>
<br>
And you KNOW I'm lying.</i>
