<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Today has been the most amazing day. I graduated.</p>
<p>My feelings are as anticipated...extremely happy. These people that I hate...that hold me back...that strip me of my value, accomplishments, and color because of my intelligence and innocense. I swear, every bit of myself was dripping with love, respect, and esteem to all those who deserved it.</p>
<p>In closing, the highlight of my night would be looking over to the lonely Aaron Shores, stripped of his convenient friends, cruel demenor, and joy. He looked choreshly at me, exhibiting all the traditional graduation glee, seeing my state of supreme joy as I realized I will never be in that hell hole ever again. I threw my cap to the wind and fell into my net of true and loving friends as he clinged onto the meaningless friends of the hour.</p>
<p>I have escaped the pain. I enter my world. Tee knows...</p>
<blockquote><i>Yes, I know. I suck at writing! Well, I started off like a bumbling idiot, but I got better. So yeah, graduation was a big deal. It is for everyone. I felt like an incredible pressure had been lifted from me<br>
<br>
The night before, Tee found an online personal I had put on XY.com, and she called me at my house to tell me that obviously someone had put it on the site as a joke (she figured it was Melissa). Well, for some reason, I knew when she called that she had found it. Something about the way she said, "Are you sitting down?! You won't guess what I found!" So I stalled, said I had to go out with my dad or something, and I jetted to April's where I hide in her room, scared shitless.<br>
<br>
April eventually was able to convince me to call her to talk to her about it. She wasn't home, so unfortunately April had to tell her at the Graduation breakfast. So yah, Tee knew. The summer ahead was a mass of embarassing acknowledgments of the giant gay pink elephant in the room that everyone pretended wasn't there, but would now have to deal with.<br>
<br>
Stress-free, and on my way to college...</i>
