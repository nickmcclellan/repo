<h2 class="date-header">The second gay guy I ever met--the second object of my obsession</h2>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Oh, it was so amazing!  We walked through North Campus and then through downtown Athens.  We had drinks at Blue Sky Coffee and talked about coming out and being gay, which was very cool.  Then we walked some more and found this really cool music store that had some really rare garbage CDs, and I even found out that Alien Sex Fiend was a band and not just a garbage b-side.  We then walked back and I told him about my mom's addiction to pain killers.  He ended up walking me to my dorm and we parted for the night.  I was up all night thinking about him; it was great!  I think I've found a really great friend...of course, now I'm feeling tons of resentments now that I'm going to try to forget and just assume he had a nice time.  Hopefully this won't blow up into another <i>disaster</i>.</p>
<blockquote><i>That first night with Greg was really nice.  Talking to someone about being gay was so odd.  Unlike my previous experience, I felt like things were on my own terms.  We had both never been in this place before, so it was new for both of us.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I found him overbearing at times.  I can be very meek and polite when you first meet me, but he totally took the flow of air at every moment during our first meeting.  However, I wasn't always the meek one...more on that later</i>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>He said I was a nice, down-to-earth guy, which is really cool.  I'm genuinely thinking now that I should not push him away from me...in a sense.  People like April, Quiana, Tee, and Mary...I don't pay much attention to them; what they do is very cut and dry, everyday.  Their roles in my life are essential, yet shroaded by my own sub-conscious.  In other words, they have grown so close to me, the only time they provoke a reaction from me is when they effect my consiousness in any way.  I never have my finger on them because there is no point.  My "finger" in other words are the words in this book.  April is rarely mentioned.  I could mention that she just moved into her college dorm as well, but it's unnecessary.  Maybe if she stimulates my consious-self this weekend when I go to a movie with her, she may be mentioned.  In closing, these people don't make waves; Greg does, and I really wish he didn't.</p>
<p>I want, for now and forever, for our relationship to be purely friendship.  But that's not how I currently percieve it; he's making major waves.  Because of this, I want to make him into more than he is.  Hopefully I can stop that from happening.  I truly know that <i>that other guy</i> was nothing, but I built the molehill he stood upon into the mountain that now lurks behind me.  Maybe I can't stop this.  Maybe I can only stunt his growth.  I just hope I can somehow get over myself so that one day I won't find myself getting over him.</p>
<p>I'd like to go into more about the best night so far here at UGA.  It turns out the best place to meet gay people would be at the Blue Sky coffee place...but I don't like coffee...problem, huh?  Well, there was this really nice music store too.  They had a Spooner album, which was the band the boys of garbage had before finding Shirley.  I think I might pikc it up someday.  I also talked to Greg about some spiritual issues of mine.  He said he hated the Catholic Church...which didn't really upset me, just made me realize that maybe Catholocism is a bit more conservative than I had originally thought...kinda sad.  I told him that I felt such a void of guilt in my spiritual self that I would watch the 700 Club to try to fill it.  I told him that I believed that there had to be something good with religion and that it was very difficult for me to completely throw out religion just because it was anti-gay...I truly believe there is something good there, there has to be!  It's religion, you can't get more good than that!  I told him that I thought if I could watch the 700 Club, I might find the line between good religion and bull-shit.  It was a good conversation</p>
<blockquote><i>Greg made waves alright.  He made waves of lost trains of thought and horrible writing, apologies!  I think it came out alright...I tend to say, "in other words..." alot.  Deal with it!<br>
<br>
This entry says alot about my issues with obsessing.  Can you imagine how easy it is for me to obsess about someone like Greg?  He was the only one there!  I mean, I was just dying for some action, how desperate I was.  I knew what was happening, I knew that I was falling for him because I had nothing better to do, and I <i>didn't want that to happen!</i>  It's hard to prevent that, though I tried.  I never perfected that technique, unfortunately.  Not until I would meet someone else that would divide my attention.</i>
