<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Alot has happened.  I'll focus on myself for now.</p>
<p>I have grown in leaps and bounds and have also valiently proved some of my values.  Upon returning from Marietta, I spent some "normal" time with Greg and Ilya and even met some really cool people like Leena, Dille, and Allyson.  This all cumulated last Thursday...</p>
<p>We all decided to go to this bar called Tasty World.  It was weird, we weren't even carded when we got in.  This worked out to be pretty good for most of my friends:  almost everyone drank.</p>
<p>I told Greg when I met him that I wasn't into alcohol or drugs, or any type of unnatural substance.  Though Leena didn't drink, I ended up being the only sober person in the midst of drunks (Leena left early with Dille).  It did good to introduce me to the fact that sometimes Greg goes too far, which was further proved to me on Friday.</p>
<p>On Friday, I went to my first gay club.  It was interesting, but was completely ruined by my jealousy.  I found out that Greg was into this guy Bill, and also Ilya's gay roommate Justin.  Anyways, I got really into dancing, and I had a pretty fun time.  We all went outside where I was "trapped" in the midst of str8 girls that came with us and Greg was immersed in all the attention.  He met this RA guy John that night, who, in my opinion, is really cool.  Anyways, back to Bill and Justin...It turns out Bill has a b/f (not Justin) and I overheard them talking out issues about Greg.  I thought I was mistaken, but Saturday night proved it to me.  Anyways, Bill, Justin, and Greg went back inside just when we all decided it was time to leave.  We all went in to get Greg, but he was dancing very close to Bill, being very intimate.  It was here when this started to go bad.</p>
<p>I swear, my jealousy was so bad that night!  I just couldn't understand WHY!  I just met Greg, why the hell am I concerned with who he's interested in.  Luckily, that was the extent of my jealousy.  Saturday would be better and much worse.</p>
<p>After an uneventful day, we all decided to go back to Tasty World again.  At this point, I have grown very close to Leena, she's a very cool person.  Our time at Tasty World was quite boring and uneventful; Greg had a whole pitcher of beer.  Good for you, loser!  We then went back to Allyson's dorm to hang out.  Greg really wanted Justin to come down.  I'm pretty sure they are into eachother.  Anyways, Leena and Dille needed a walk home, so I took them with me.  Greg also decided to go along.  I thought, selfishly, that he wanted to go to talk with me.  I didn't realize that Dille lived in O-house, and so did Bill.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Bill and his whole group of friends were outside of O-house.  Because I wasn't very familiar with these people, I talked to Leena about her issues with Ilya.  It turns out that he was getting close with her in order to get Allyson jealous.  I told her it was such a non-issue. Greg had some things to say to me, but he was durnk and had other priorities.  Bill was going to drive home one of his friends, and Greg went along.</p>
<p>I should have been insanely jealous, but I admitted defeat.  Greg doesn't like me, end of story.  I can only be his friend.  I proceeded to talk to Rachel and Leena for a very long time.  It was great!  I told them about my opinions on bi guys and what it was like for myself being gay.  Bill and Greg returned to go talk somewhere in O-house.  I ended up in Rachel's room until about 5 in the morning.  I felt so much better about everything.  I gave up on Greg.</p>
<p>After a mildly entertaining Sunday out with Jen and Greg, I went back home to work on some work.  Leena invited me to dinner, so I went.  She told me that Greg and Bill had "hooked up" Saturday night.  I thought that was kinda weird.  Bill has a b/f!  That's just so fucked up, in my opinion.  Why would Greg hook up with a guy that would cheat on his b/f!  Greg still hasn't told me about that night.  I don't think he considers me a very good friend yet.  This concludes my description of last week...which is only the beginning!  Tuesday night was pretty cool.  Ilya and Leena got pierced and I got to know Dille better.  She's very cool.  We went back to my dorm to watch South Park.  Greg said something really nice that night too.  Ilya said something mean like he didn't want to drive with me alone in the car.  When Greg was explaining this to Dille, he said, "Yah, I don't see why Ilya wouldn't want to drive with such a genuine nice guy like Nick."  That was nice of Greg to say and it made me feel good.  During South Park, he fell asleep on my bean bag and he looked so cute sleeping soundly.  I realized then that I had a thing for him, but I also decided to keep it to myself...but I did tell April and Tee.</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot about Monday, which was very cool.  I went with Greg to the Lambda meeting and met alot of people.  The President of the club was very nice to me and really cute.  We ended up eating dinner together, the whole club.  I also go to meet John, the RA guy, and Bill.</p>
<p>A short description on the two...Bill is what I would call "trashy gay."  He regularly wears make-up!  Greg things that just because a guy is guy, that means he should conform to stereotypes like that.  I so don't agree.  John is really cool.  He's an older guy, as Bill is as well.  He's a Trekkie too, which I used to be, so I got to chat with him about that last night.</p>
<p>Anyways...Wednesday...my best night...my night of firsts!  We went out to Boneshakers on no cover night.  We went with only gay guys, so that was a clear indication that I was gay.  When we got there, the guy that looked like my uncle wouldn't leave me alone!  I met this really cute Saudi Arabian guy that I think was interested in me.  When we were dancing, I think he wanted me to dance close to him, but there was no way I could.  I'm so scared of stuff like that.  I ended up outside again and talked to Rachel and Bill.  It was ok, I try not to let anyone know I'm interested in them, I just chill and talk.</p>
<p>Well, before it was time to go, we all went back in to dance again.  That's when it happened...</p>
<p>This guy Sean started to dance really close to me.  It was so hot!  I think the erm was "dance fuck," it was great.  I could feel him...you know what I mean, and I couldn't help but be excited.  We held eachother and it was so intimate.  He guided my hands all over his body, it was very VERY hot.  We were so sweaty, and it was like spreading our sweat all over eachother...it was the closest to sex that I've ever gotten.  I realized I could do it.  Whe we left, he hugged me, and that was it.</p>
<p>I haven't seen him yet since, so that's why I want to go to Boneshakers tonight again.  The whole time while I was dancing throughout the night, Greg was getting really into John.  I figured they would be dating.  I'm happy for them, but I still like Greg.  I'll keep that close to my heart, and maybe, one day, I might find Greg in my arms...</p>
<blockquote><i>PUKE!  Yah, you know I suck.<br>
<br>
So a big entry.  Alot of things happened that week.  I had finally established a clique, gone to my first gay club, been convinced I was into Greg, and did the "bad dancing."  Yeah, and it's true!  I did have a crush on Aiman freshman year, he's very attractive.  Unfortunately, nothing came of it until my Sophomore year.<br>
<br>
I remember spending hours writing this particular entry.  I was just so washed up in my new life, it took forever to chronicle it all.  Fortunate for you, I continued to pay attention to detail...</i>
