<h2 class="date-header">My friendship with Greg begins to unravel after a dangerous brush with...COUGH MEDICINE!</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I had a very interesting Saturday.  I got a call from Drunk Greg around the beginning of the football game.  I met up with them and went back to Allyson's room.  By the way, Ilya was extremely drunk, after drinking 8 beers.  We ended up going to Wal-Mart, where I happily fixed my brake lights FINALLY.  It turned out that Greg and Ilya both got cough medicine to get high off of, which turned out to be very dumb.  Us three ended up going to AMF for a rave type dance.  Greg felt kinda tipsy and needed water, Ilya got some as well.  Ilya then disappeared, and it turned out he was getting sick in the bathroom.  He threw up, which was quite gross, and got us kicked out.  We then decided to go to Boneshakes, but didn't get very far when Ilya became unable to walk.  Greg took charge of the situation while I stood in disbelief.  We did end up at Boneshakers, but decided we should take Ilya back to the dorm.  We got him to the Russell lawn, where, I swear, an angel (or some really nice guy) came up and helped get Ilya to my room where he could rest and get better.  It was an eventful night.</p>
<p>I felt then that I had grown closer to Greg then.  I made him popcorn and got him water and also let him play games on my laptop.  I think he was surprised with how nice I was to him.  I ended up walking with him and it was really cool.  I don't know what I want from Greg, I just wish I could be his close friend, but I don't think he likes me very much.</p>
<p>He's very opinionated and not very accepting of what others think, especially when they are different than his ideas.  My views on September 11, 2001 (explained earlier) annoyed him, particularly since he thought what happened was not preventable.  I refused to stand down from my views and kinda pissed him off as well.  I just don't care and hope he'll get over this and not hold it against me.  I'm sure if he's as cool as I hope he is, he'll realize this.</p>
<blockquote><i>My night with Greg was really special to me.  We went to the "Honors Bubble" and sat and talk.  I remember talking about my dog Brandy alot and just feeling really happy that he was actually speding one-on-one time with me.  I was in my pajama pants and tennis shoes...it was definitely a sight.<br>
<br>
Greg decided to head back to Creswell with Ilya after he woke up, though I invited him to stay the night.  They left, and I went to bed.  Sadly, it was the only time since the day we first met that I really got a chance to talk to Greg.  After this Saturday, he and I would grow more and more apart, until the day our friendship was a distant memory.</i>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Things changed last night.  The back of my whole "thing" for Greg finally broke.  I woke up this morning so pissed off at him.  I finally realized what was going on.</p>
<p>Greg is...an idiot!  A fool!  He is everything I can expect from an egotistical, selfish, troubled, "high school" DUMBASS!  The whole September 11, 2001 thing ended up with him responding to my e-mail with no outside information refuting everything I said.  Of course, I know I can bury him with my arguments, but I won't.  This is just like the Bobby/Global Warming argument; I simply need to accept that Greg is ignorant, and will never have the capability to look outside the box.</p>
<p>He is sifting through people, picking them up, and leaving them behind.  That's kinda what happened to me, but that doesn't trouble me so much.  It's kinda sad; I would have really enjoyed getting to know someone like Greg, but he's into other things.</p>
<p>For one, he can't be interesting unless he's drinking alcohol.  That is so weak.  It's such a waste, and so dangerous.  Another point is how STUPID he is with drugs.  I will never understand why anyone would turn to a drug for a high; it's so stupid.  Popping 16 cough medicine pills is PATHETIC.  he really needs to grow up.  He has no values, no goals; simply get drunk and have fun.  I'm worried he won't be back next year.  It's ok, I've resolved to move on.</p>
<p>I'm going to call Juan tonight to see if he wants to go to Boneshakers tonight.  If he isn't there, I might see if Missy wants to watch Silence of the Lambs or Joy Luck Club.  Either way, I'm going to try to leave this hideous circle that worships Greg.  God, I mean, COME ON!  He's a LOSER!</p>
<blockquote><i>So, I finally wised up and realized that Greg really never respected me and was really going a completly different direction then I was going.  It was hard to sort through my attraction to Greg and separate it from my real need to leave the bastard in the gutter.  It's not a good thing to worship someone that you think is attractive and a person you'd like to be with when in reality they treat you like shit, don't value you, and would obviously much rather be with someone else.  It's sad, it hurts...rejection sucks.  I've had to deal with it--eveyone has!  It's best to realize you'll be alright by yourself, separate, and move on.<br>
<br>
Oh, and by the way...HE DIDN'T COME BACK THE NEXT YEAR!</i>
