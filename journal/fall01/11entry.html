<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm a bit uncollected on my recent spoken opposition to Greg.  I found that most of the day Sunday, I was hoping somehow I could once again be close to Greg.  I was also thinking that maybe I'm blowing things out proportion.  It makes alot of sense, how I've come to land on this situation.  With my experiences with people in general, it fits.  However, I'm sheepishly hoping I'm wrong; hoping I won't have to build my forces against Greg.  through uncollected, I am decided.</p>
<p>I'm not avoiding Greg.  If I saw him, I would definately say hey.  I won't call him, there's nothing to say.  If he called me, I would not be mean, I'd just be nonchalant and receptive.  Basically, I'm wearing a mask toward Greg; I'm trying to figure out how to use it with him.</p>
<p>I came up with a great garbage song for this whole incident!  "I Think I'm Paranoid" explains it well.  If I feel like it, I'll copy the lyrics later.</p>
<p>My Saturday night, and weekend as a whole, did not yield a trip to Boneshakers.  I tired to call Juan, but he wasn't there.  I'll try to chat with him at the Lambda meeting if he's interested.  I got a unique chance to talk to John though.  I watched Silence of the Lambs with him about why I felt so pissed about September 11, 2001 and Greg's reaction toward my opinions.  I told him about the best day of my life and how that has impacted how I am affected by what other people think of me.  It was a good conversation.</p>
<blockquote><i>Yah, it's a good think I became friends with John.  Thankfully his relationship with Greg was short, but his relationship with me has remained consistant over the years.  He's a genuine great guy, and though he's not around anymore, I'll be damn sure no one forgets about good ol' John.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned in the previous entry, around this time I began becoming pretty interested in this guy Juan I met at Lambda.  He seemed interested in me, I could sense, and he was really cute.  Sometimes Missy and I would see him at lunch and we would sit with him.  More on him as the situation develops...</i>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm feeling reassured about myslef more and more everyday.  I really think meeting Greg has burnt me in the worst way.  I was very prepared to throw myself down to him, thinking he'd just pick me up and be a friend to me.  NO.  He can't do that.  I know now exactly how twisted and problemed that boy is.  He's so damn selfish and he values nothing; not himself, not his body, not his future, not the people that can truly care about him, not NOTHING.</p>
<p>I truly wish I could help him.  I wish he would just drop down his walls and just let me in.  I wish he would get to know me and begin to realize how wonderful I could truly be to him.  I wish for all of these things.  I don't know why.  I'm just really so much better off without him.</p>
<p>I've heard he's skipping alot of classes.  That's really very sad.  He doesn't eve value the whole reason he chose to come to the University of Georgia; to pursue a Veternary degree.  Despite his apparent adoration of animals, he shows no desire to actually get off his drunken/drugged ass to try for his dream.  That's another thing that troubles me about Greg.  He says all these things:  "I'm going to do THIS."; "We're going to do THAT"; He's a LIAR!  NO VALUES!</p>
<p>I'm completely opposite when I want something to be done.  I'm usually right on it or I'm on it later.  I feel that if I'm going to project myself as something or someone, I should hold true to that.  This contrast explains why I'm so angry with Greg.</p>
<p>I avoided him yesterday.  I saw him with some people (it's always someone new) and I just kept walking, wishing I hadn't seen him in the first place.  I have no reason to talk to him, and really, no desire.</p>
<blockquote><i>I sound like the psycho ex-boyfriend, don't I?!  I don't know, he really did burn me.  And this is my personal journal!  It was really calming to write all these things down, because I was really feeling them!  I'm obviously very jealous of Greg.  I felt burned because he could go on so seemlessly without me, and to him I really was worth nothing.  It hit me hard to know that I was not really very special to him.  It was sad to accept that, and this entry is basically me grasping at straws.<br>
<br>
No, really, I'll stop talking about Greg any day now!</i>
