<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>The back of the bulk of my boredom was broken today when Greg finally called.  I wanted to watch a movie in my room with him.  I thought it would be pretty cool.  I think Ilya is coming too.  From what Greg tells me, I think Ilya is gay.  However, I think he's kinda cocky about it.  It seems like he's not open about it.  I'm not sure if he's genuinely unsure or if he's bi.  For some reason, if he turned out to be bi, that would trouble me more.</p>
<p>Bi guys, I believe, are tow things:  Buy guys or gay gus.  Buy guys are guys that have something to get from sleeping with another guy.  Some str8 guys just don't get why guys would be attracted to eachother, but I KNOW that a whole bunch of those str8 guys deep down want their buddies to be intimate with them.  I wish Ilya was like this.  Form all that I've seen from him, I don't like him too much.  I'll get to see him more tonight possibly, so things might be different.  Anyways, bi guys that are gay.  I really think the majority of bi guys are really gay.  The pressure of society is more than powerful enough to convince a guy it's best to compromise with his sexuality.  Everything guys are told from birth is to like girls.  However, their own individual sexuality tesll them to sleep with other guys.  It's so confusing, a guy may use his heterosexuality thats imbedded in his mind to satisfy social pressures; family, church, school, etc.  However, like virtually every teen, the guy also exists on a subcultural, youthful, rebelious level.  This is where the "bi" guy feels he can truly enjoy his homosexuality.  He's completely free of all social barriers.  However, existing on both of these levels seems like "having your cake and eating it too," which is just cheap.  These "bi" guys are just cheap and selfish, embracing the pleasure love presents them instead of the deep lover that makes great sex great.  I think Ilya is a "bi" guy, but I wish he was a buy guy.</p>
<p>When Greg told me that Ilya was coming over, he said, "Threesome!"  Oh my God!  That would be alittle too much for me.  Ilya has that sexual energy about him.  He could turn tonights movie into a real ackward situation.</p>
<p>Sigh...things are so complicated, but it's cool.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  I've grown out of my family and friends well.  I've transcended.  Sadly, I've transcended April too.  she's done the same to me though.  Convinced that she's really in love, she's left me, forcing me to leave her.  If she falls from her place with Matt, she may find that I'm no longer there to be her best friend.  I wish I could have told her all about my new friends, but she's got her head too far up her ass, she wouldn't listen.</p>
<p>I've transcended McEachern as well.  I saw Caleb, Jill, and Lori.  They can't leave high school behind them:  it was there best time.  Caleb especially.  He's gay, one of these guys that tried the whole gay thing, and then continued to lie to himself.  He can't be helped.  He needs to realized that he needs to be true to himself and to stop fearing who he is.  I won't make Aaron's mistake; I won't go into anyone's closet.  I will help Greg though, he's very cool.</p>
<blockquote><i>OH MY GOD, what was my problem?  I was so undersexed then!  Wow, everything about being gay had to do with guys sleeping together.  I was so out of it.  Is that how freshman think?  Sex, sex, sex, sex, and a little more sex?  Apparently it's true!</i>
