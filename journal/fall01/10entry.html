<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm feeling off track.  I'm feeling lost and unspecial.  It's not a fun thing.  I don't know if it's my fault or the people I've let surround me.  It seems like I have several close friends here.  Leena, Missy, and Allyson are very sweet.  Greg is a complete worthless person; it's unfortunate that I allowed him to cloud my mind during such a crucial time here, though I'm uncertain where I'd be without him.</p>
<p>Anyways, I feel as I felt when I got here.  It's become apparent that I'm not welcome among Greg and his friends.  It hurts that the first gay guy that ever truly excepted me has turned out to reject me, a feeling I'm all too accustomed to.  Fortunately, the shell that I have built, the walls I have constructed, they have not fallen; Greg could not penetrate them.  They are cracked and shattered; but I remain impregnable.</p>
<p>Apparently, I have to move on.  It seems that maybe I could talk more with Juan or Aiman.  Juan, I really don't know too much about, but I have his number.  I wanted to go to Boneshakers tonight with Greg and whoever, but apparently, I'm not welcome.</p>
<p>Aiman is really friendly.  I could see me associating with him more.  It's hard to say whether I could get close to these two guys, but I wish I could.</p>
<p>I can't become subordinate to anyone, I won't allow it.  I didn't allow it in high school, and I found some of the most amazing and coolest people ever.  If I became subordinate to someone here, I would be foreced to change myslef to appeal to that person.  I've felt that maybe the ways I act and think are not right.  I've done that because it was expected from me, from Greg.  Because I did not conform to his idea of how I should be, I stood out like a sore thumb.  He was unable to assimilate me into his life, so I was pushed away.  It was when I forcefully refused to fit into his "social pool" that I first realized what was happening.  I refused to conform to his ideas about September 11, 2001, arguing against his points, rippling the surface, making splashes, upsetting his world.  I have been pushed out and away.</p>
<p>I have two choices.  I could take a dive, throwing away the walls and barriers, giving up a part of myself to conform to Greg's world...that would NEVER happen.  I Vow this.</p>
<p>My second choice, and ultimatly the only choice, is to oppose Greg.  To use my qualities to decend into my own circle of friends, constucting my own social opposite to Greg.  In contrast, I could build real realtionships, like I'm so good at.  It will be hard, but I can try.  Apparently, Aaron wasn't the only selfish asshole gay guy.</p>
<blockquote><i>This is the crux of the first part of my first semester at UGA.  This realization that I could stand on my own really helped get me through the rest of the year.  I realized that I did have alot of good friends at UGA.  Why should the absense of Greg make any difference?  Was he really the source of my happiness?  Why couldn't my best friend be Leena, or Allyson...or Missy.<br>
<br>
Basically, I stopped expecting Greg to miraculously come back and be a true friend to me.  I holed up all that rejection and used it as a reason to soldier through.  I'm actually really good at that, taking lemons and making lemonade.  Sexy Missy Lemonade :-*</i>
