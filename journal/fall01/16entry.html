<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Ok...Jason is SO over.  That was certainly not as good as I made it out to be.  I'm so much more experienced now, which is good.  Being in a relationship for the first time was good, but it was not all that...</p>
<p>I'm in an interesting place now.  I'm feeling just a bit depressed.  April and Matt are in love, and I'm jealous.  I'm so jealous that she has that one person to be with forever, and I don't.  It makes me feel so hopeless.  I can really only describe how I'm feeling through garbage...</p>
<p><u>Nobody Loves You</u><br>
by:  garbage<br>
<br>
Watching the days slip by so fast<br>
Knowing our fate has long been cast<br>
Working our fingers to the bone<br>
Cause nobody loves you when you're gone, gone, gone, gone<br>
<br>
Coughing up feeling just for you<br>
To find something real to hold on to<br>
But there is a hole inside my heart<br>
Where all of my love comes pouring out<br>
<br>
You know you'll always be my man<br>
But grab yourself sweetness where you can<br>
'Cause sooner or later we're gonna die<br>
Left to the dogs under the sky<br>
<br>
I cracked a piece of broken glass<br>
I cracked a piece of broken glass<br>
<br>
Coughing up feeling just for you<br>
To find something real to hold on to<br>
But there is a hole inside my heart<br>
Where waves of my love come tumbling out<br>
<i>You say that all the good is gone<br>
That I have forgotten who I am<br>
Free as a bird<br>
Wild as the wind<br>
But somehow I cannot let you in</i></p>
<blockquote><i>So that's it.  The source of it all.  The reason for the website.  The reason for...everything.  It all comes back to her.  April Smith<br>
<br>
I was jealous, obviously.  They had a song!  A pretty song too, the Beatles' "Here, There, and Everywhere."  To me, it was like she ignored the world when she was with him, and she ignored me.  She didn't care about me, why would she?  What worth am I to her?  This garbage song incapsulated what I was feeling, and it was a response to her happiness.  She had forgotten me, and I had to soldier on in her absense.<br>
<br>
When I made the website, before every thing was launched, I noticed a "Web Effects" icon on my FrontPage program.  There was a marquee option, which was really the only thing that interested me.  What do I write here?</blockquote></i>
<marquee>Hi, I'm Nick!  Welcome to my WEBSITE!</marquee>
<blockquote><i>Nope.  That wouldn't work.  Well, I was listening to those songs, the Beatles and garbage, and it hit me...</blockquote></i>
<marquee>"You say...I've forgotten who I am"...but you don't even know I'm here...</marquee>
<blockquote><i>So that's where it's from.  It's not my own zany creation, I stole it from Shirley and John Lennon.  It's all thanks to them.  I imagine no one really cares, but that's it.  If you ever wondered what that thing meant and why I never changed it, that's why.  I don't change it, because I don't forget.  The feeling that your best friend has left you for someone else really hurts, but we deal.  We make website, we have our revenge, and we get over it.  Life goes on.<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading, I hope it was annoyingly insightful as it was for me to write.  I apologize for typos...but you have no idea how illiterate I was back then!  Never forget that Freshman are stupid and you should stay away from them.  And they smell.<br>
<br>
Except for me...I never smelled 8-)</i>
