<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, April 23rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I must say I'm a bit upset. I'm so sick of this living situation. It has completely failed miserably. I'm a heartbeat away from jumping in my car right now and driving home. Why am I so bored with EVERYTHING? I try to do interesting and fun things, but I'm at a complete loss now-a-days. Why is this so? I certainly have my ideas, and I don't think I want to spread them around here. I just wish I could enjoy whatever time I have left here, but I don't want to do it trapped within the four walls of my room.<br>
<br>
Missy and Gen are both very mean and spiteful people for what they did to me at the beginning of this week. It all started with my unfortunate flu sickness that plagued me last week. It may be why I didn't have a journal for the whole week, though I would probably attribute that to the fact that I'm a lazy person and just didn't want to tell you about how horrible I was feeling. Anyways, I was talking to Gen (who happened to be very gracious to me on Tuesday when she drove me to my Spanish class) on Sunday about how my roommate had also caught the flu (obviously from me) and had puked while at his race this weekend. She said that he had probably caught a stronger strand, OBVIOUSLY since I didn't throw up. I was intrigued...it was more reasonable to assume that he caught the exact same virus from me since he had been in the room with me most of the time I was sick. Well, she implied and stated that it was obvious because I had such an inferior immune system because of my bad diet. I found this to be very very rude of her to say. It's not like am a morbidly obese individual! I don't have huge diet issues that would warrant me being very unhealthy. Needless to say, I was upset...<br>
<br>
I had lunch with Missy on Monday and I started the conversation addressing how I was upset with Gen about her comments about my health. Missy continued by saying that it was true, my diet was atrocious, and said, &quot;There is nothing significantly nutritious about what you are eating there...&quot; I was so angry! How can one of my best friends be so critical about something that is absolutely none of her business! I told her that she shouldn't be so critical about me because I wasn't critical about her, and I seemed to have struck a nerve. She seemed like she was ready to rip into me and all my faults and all these things she had built up against me to bash me down with. I was silently stunned, why would she be so childish and stupid...I certainly don't hold anything against her character at all. Such an idea would be blasphemous in the name of friendship. I quickly dropped the subject, letting her know that any other comments of a critical nature by her toward me or my habits would not be tolerated.<br>
<br>
What is wrong with these people? Why do they have to hold these things against me? Is this how my best friends here are supposed to treat me? I feel that this is more serious then they have themselves believe. It would be one thing if they observe me constantly eating unhealthy things and growing progressively obese and overweight, but that is not the case here. I am no FATTER then I was when I first came here. I eat very well, thank you very much, I like to think I eat in moderation. And the whole idea that I eat unhealthy is LAUGHABLE because the term UNHEALTHY can be applied to ANYTHING! Sure, french fries, Coke, butter, ice cream, whipped cream, cookies, fried chicken...all unhealthy. I'm sure that reading these things, you wouldn't agree with me. They are perfectly warranted in their comments if I only eat all these things...and you would be right, but mislead. I eat everything listed above but IN MODERATION! It's not like I'm constantly stuffing my face with hamburgers and french fries, I'M NOT! I eat many healthy things like baked potatoes, rice, bread, corn, broccoli, etc. I shouldn't have to make a list and explain myself to anyone! My diet issues are between me and my doctor and if anyone has a problem with it, I had better be causing problems with their health or any of their comments are completely useless to me.<br>
<br>
I have uncovered from these discussions a serious problem with both Missy and Genevieve about their own conceptions about healthy body image. I found our earlier when Gen commented that Kelly from The Osbournes was very overweight and unhealthy.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="kelly1.jpg" width="240" height="320"></p>
<p>IT'S RIDICULOUS! Other then having minor pudginess, she is in now way horribly disfigured through obesity! She's just a normal teenage girl! This uncovers a huge problem Gen and Missy and about half of America has with body image.<br>
<br>
What's the problem here? Do we all have to be washboard ABed Adonis's or else be forever marked as morbidly obese??? My answer is NO! We all have our unique and BEAUTIFUL body image and we shouldn't sell out like Gen and Missy and just accept that we're ugly and we have to change. I happen to think that both Gen and Missy are beautiful and they don't need to change a single hair on their head. I think that Kelly Osbourne is beautiful as well. I think that if she had an weight issues at all that that would not be my problem to worry about, but her doctor's. We need to get off the cases of others, we need to start worrying about ourselves and not the petty body images of other people. WHO CARES! There are so many more important things to preoccupy our time with. There are so many problems in this world other then the fact that that girl on T. V. doesn't look like Britney Spears. Why don't you just get a life and worry about something that MATTERS!
