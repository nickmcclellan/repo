<p>Not much to say for the week before Spring Break. I had a Spanish test this week. That turned out to be alright. It was interesting, because Thursday afternoon, which I had intending on spending in the library studying for my Spanish test, I instead found it to be very nice outside and decided to study outdoors. It got so awful studying that I absolutely had to write some sort of poetry. It turned out to be very good, but I'm not yet finished.<br>
<br>
I decided that I would finish it at the beautiful beaches of Destin. I will be going there this Tuesday, and I'm really excited about going. It's going to be so much fun! Anyways, I digress...<br>
<br>
I had a very stressful drive back home, but I would like to thank my good friend Rachel for being there for me and keeping me slightly sane...even though I felt I was trapped in an iron cage. I had a nice day on Saturday with my friend Katy. I got to see her after months of being in college. It was a nice afternoon Spring Break shopping. It's too bad that APRIL couldn't join us. I figured that she would jump at the chance to see a friend she hasn't seen in months...let alone a friend she hasn't seen since graduation. I hope that her weekend wasn't too stressful, I mean, she didn't even return my call, she must have been really busy. I hope she'll make it though.<br>
<br>
Well, there will NOT be an update next week, but I will be putting up some Spring Break photos the week after HOPEFULLY as well as a Spring Break Journal that will be full of juicy stuff. You'll have to wait patiently for that though. I will be writing in it every night, whether I'm sober or drunk...you'll have to guess...hehehe, tootles!
