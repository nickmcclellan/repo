<div class="post">
<p>Tonight I saw the worst excuse for American television I've seen in the longest time. Tonight's episode of The Real World (a horrible joke, as nothing in the show resembles SLIGHTLY the REAL WORLD) featured the female character Cara reacting to what her roommate Chris considered an innocent pinch on her thigh. Cara reacted very surprised and upset as Chris has revealed her budding &quot;weight problem&quot;, where she has gained an understandably enormous 7 pounds. It turned out alright, as Cara was &quot;empowered&quot; with the arrival of her ex-b/f who gave her encouraging remarks like, &quot;You're sexy and good-looking&quot; and proceeded to have sex with her.<br>
<br>
This blatant shallowness and lack of complete SUBSTANCE is American culture today. When did we become so completely vapid and ignorant that we stress over something as INSIGNIFICANT as a young woman's eating disorder. SHE'S A SIZE ZERO! THIS IS WHAT WE ARE SUPPOSED TO CONSIDER COMPELLING TELEVISION? What has happened here?<br>
<br>
A friend of mine, who shall remain nameless, found the exchange some what of a hinting toward the problem of anorexia and its impact on young adults. I find that though this may be present (poorly addressed, I may add), why are we so wrapped up with this issue in a post 9-11 America?<br>
<br>
People are dying in Israel in a conflict that is seemingly impossible to regulate, and we Americans are STRESSING over 10 pounds. The message of the episode may have been reinforced and somewhat acceptable if this Cara person did not find strength and resolve from &quot;hooking up&quot; with her ex-b/f. What does that say to a woman who is really suffering from a serious eating disorder? When you feel down about those 7 pounds you've recently added to your tummy, you might as well look toward a man to make it all better by having sex with him and then having him fly away. What is America? Are we this shallow? Are we this stupid? Does anyone get me? Am I the only person that was disgusted by this irresponsible display of complete stupidity?<br>
<br>
I have to know, I know that America is more then skinny valley girls, there has to be more there...
