<p>Oh, it was awful. Our TA in Critical Thinking decided to create a seating chart for our lecture. This I don't understand, as college students, seating charts seem really childish...apparently the professor will have some cruel adaptation of this, I'm sure. Well, this day just HAPPENED to be the same day Mr. Excess-Cologne guy decided to sit by me again, so now I am fated to sit next to him for the rest of the semester...oh, goodie. I will be sure to pack garbage every day to ensure that he gets the idea that I am NOT to be socialized with.<br>
<br>
I saw a really nice Real World episode episode that was a great depiction on how two men can really fall in love...and I felt really sad because I am out of this loop. I have no one to fall in love with, and no one that boasts any potential either. I was a bit more upset about this last semester, but now, it's not that bad, or as bad. I'm realizing I wish I could have a meaningful relationship with some guy, whether it be romantic or just a friendship, but I don't have it. I have always tried to get it, but it's been always cheapened somehow. He is always some slime-ball or something inside of me pushes me away from him. I know that I want someone to love, but I am managing now. I can keep this together for now, but soon, I just wish I could have someone. It would make things very nice.

<p>I had an okay week, except for Friday. Friday I was introduced to my new worst nemesis. Her name is Reynolds, and she will be stopped. Reynolds is a psychotic mutant lesbian that came from Mars. Her favorite number is 52, which she has branded me with. I was hurt, shocked, and appalled, but was only all the more pissed off when I came to. I am going to show that bitch a thing or two about MY writing. I'm going to show her that I can't be pushed around. I'm going to show her what the FUCK got me on the Dean's List. I'm going to show her that NO ONE fails Nick.<br>
<br>
Besides that bitch Reynolds, I had a Queer As Folk weekend. Let me tell you, I am very charged homosexually. I am so NOT feeling gay right now. I am not even WITH any gay friends. I want a gay friend so bad. I know i went off on that a little earlier, but I really feel that that's what would be so wonderful to have. I want someone that can show me what it's like to be gay. It's what I wanted Greg to be, but he never was. It's what I wanted Tim to be, but he never was. I am stuck in the cycle of rejection, constantly, over and over, and I'm just thrown to the wind every time I try. I flew into April's arms after Tim, I realized that I could not handle this gay thing alone, and I needed her. Now it seems like she's never there, and I can't ever talk to her. It seems like we're falling apart, like she's abandoned me. I cling onto Missy for dear life because I don't know what I would do without her. She is my stability. She is the one thing that hasn't betrayed me, and I love her to death for that. Where am I supposed to go now? I have a thought...pride? This summer there's pride. I'm afraid I'm going to get swept up into some older crowd, but I don't know, it's all a jumble of thoughts. Anthony said it really changed him, and I feel that might be a good thing for me. I will defiantly be needing some change.<br>
<br>
ANYWAYS! Less sad ponderings...GARBAGE is coming to ATLANTA on May 5th, 2002! Garbage will be playing Sunday afternoon at Music Midtown, and I will be at Shirley's toes, lost in ecstasy...NOT E, by the way. I would like to extend an invitation to any of my good friends that would like to come with me. I'm sure Missy and Gen will be up for it, and Jen said she would go too. I can't wait, I'm so glad I get to see a show completely devoted to garbage. I saw them open for U2, and that was amazing, but I need more. I want to hear b-sides, I want to hear Version 2.0 LIVE, and in my face, I WANT TO SEE SHIRLEY AND THE BOYS ROCK OUT! I am so looking forward to this.<br>
<br>
ONCE AGAIN, I apologize for not updating at all this week. I know I've promised gay friends and new lyrics, but I really haven't found the energy. I am finished with Anthony and Rob's page, half finished on Geoff's, and I haven't even started John's. I just haven't been up to it lately. Maybe I'll find some of that good ol' energy this week, but it's doubtful. I'll be using it to show that bitch Reynolds...SHUT UP BITCH, REYNOLDS, YOU'LL GET YOURS! I VOW TO IT!<br>
<br>
Until later my Darklings...
