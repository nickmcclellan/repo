<p>Oh, what a week this week has been. Starting off completely miserable and concluding spirtually uplifting, it has been quite a ride. I had to drop my Philosophy class this week. Ok, I know, Philosophy...who the FUCK cares about philosophy...well, it's not that I didn't need it, it's that I failed. I got a 59 on a test I should have got an 80 on. I was so scattered and weak that I was unable to handle this class and was forced to release it from my schedule. That really hurts me.<br>
<br>
I got a good poem out of it, however, which I added to the site tonight. It's ok, it is not good, I know, but it's a development of my poetic talents, I know. Someday I will hopefully be as talented and profound as Lauryn Hill is in her writing of poetry and verse.<br>
<br>
I had the most amazing opportunity to see Lauryn Hill in concert, I am so lucky to have had this experience. It was possibly the most spritually profound experience I have ever had. I know, well, maybe second best. Standing on top of that cathedral outside of Paris was the most free I've ever felt, so definatly Lauryn Hill has pointed out alot of things I didn't know were there.<br>
<br>
Mostly the concept of impression. That was the biggest thing I got from her. I will definatly be chewing on that word for a while.<br>
<br>
Well, I got an 85.5 on Reynolds test. That's more my style, yes, definatly. I know that I can do better, of course, and I will. A's on all her future tests, I will try.<br>
<br>
Mmmm...well, if I'm going to put &quot;Failing&quot; on the site and tweek the index page, I had better stop writing this crap. Still not back 100%, though I felt alittle creative juices, just had no desire to put that toward the site. I was trying to fix my banners so you all could read the font, but that did not work out out I wanted. I may try SOMTHING tonight that might work. You all will have to let me know if it does. Well, tootles all, ONE WEEK LEFT TILL SPRING BREAK!
