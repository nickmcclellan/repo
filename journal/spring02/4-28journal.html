<p>Well this gulf between Missy and Gen and I has seemed to become silently permanent. I can't say that I don't regret this, but then I really don't think it's my place to say anything. Obviously, it is apparent that they are upset with me about something so damn important that it warrants not talking to me, so I'm just going to let them cook with whatever that is. I feel a little let down however, I figured that they would have some concern over why I might be upset, obviously I overestimate their values on friendship. I just don't understand how they can just not talk to me. It really hurts me that they can harbor such anger towards me, it's like they didn't ever care about me. It's so sick and disgusting, I just don't know how I'm going to solve this problem. I suspect that I shouldn't be that upset with Genevieve, she really doesn't harbor anything awful towards me. I feel a bit upset about what she said about all that diet crap, but I don't think I should keep to that for too long, it's really not that important, not as important as she is to me. I will definitely try to talk things over with her.<br>

In other Nick related news, any hopes for an A in bitch-Reynolds class is lost. I got an 81 on the last test of the semester. I am hopeful that this won't squander my hopes to get at least a B in the class, so that is my priority at this time. This just means I need to nail the ENGL2310 final so I get an A in that class. I have a much better chance at doing that anyways. Studying for English finals is not an easy thing to do, so any prayers would be appreciated. I won't have to take that final until Monday night, so this should be published by then, so PRAY AWAY!<br>
<br>
Semester's winding down, and I'm happy this is so. I will be anxious to get back to work and also to get back with some good friends. I'm really excited about seeing Nicole again and hopefully we can get together this summer to do some party fun, I know that she and I could have a wonderful time. I also got to talk to April this weekend, it was nice. I wish her luck on her finals, she's really got it hard.<br>

I HAVE FIXED THE SHIT-MOBILE. I have not however fixed it to the point of it no longer being called SHIT-MOBILE. I was having trouble with the battery, the car wouldn't start last week, had to get it jumped a bunch. Well, I took it to Big 10 Tires and they said the battery was bad, so I took it to AutoZone, where I bought it, and insisted on getting a new battery since I had a 2 year warranty on the battery. I then took it back to Big 10 Tires where they proceeded to check the alternator, which they suspected of overcharging the battery, thus causing it to go bad. They were right, and since they warranty the alternator I had put on a year or two ago, they proceeded to replace that. SUDDENLY...the car never turns off the radio randomly ANYMORE!!! Is that not the best thing that has ever happened this year??? This is great for me! I just want to thank everyone who has pulled for Shit-mobile since the beginning...it's people like you that has made this day possible. Well, I have to do nothing until I go to bed...very busy, I am...cya!
