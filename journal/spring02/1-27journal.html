<div class="post">
<p>I've been having so much fun with this new thing with the website. It's been very cool to put all this creative energy to work. For some reason, lately, I've felt like I needed to make something. It started with my relapse into Sherry Cherry comics. Ever since I was in 7th grade, I have been randomly writing these comics based on the life of a character I made up, Sherry Cherry. It was a nice outlet, but I found that I didn't find it all that fun most of the time, so most of the time, I would just not make any comics. Then, for some reason, I'd just start drawing it again...very bizarre. I guess I just have creative streaks...hopefully I won't leave this site un-updated and festering in the cold abyss of the internet...but, unfortunately, that's very likely.<br>
<br>
The last few days, well, every since last Thursday, I have felt the need to go to the gym more often. On Thursday I just felt so fat and unattractive, I was overwhelmed with the need to go running. Even though I'm not fat and unattractive, I still felt that way. Today, I ran TWICE, and I did some work on the torture machines...I was very diligent! Hopefully tomorrow I'll wake up early enough to go running before class at 2 and lunch at 1. I'm usually waking up at 10 anyways, so I think I will be able to do that. Who knows? It's already 1:52 on Tuesday now...my adventures in dream land may keep me longer then I wish...hehehe.<br>
<br>
There are a few songs I've been exposed to today that really kick ass! One, I received late from a request I made last Saturday night. Garbage's &quot;Kick My Ass&quot; Live is very cool, it sounds like Shirley wants to cry or something. My WONDERFUL friend Allyson suggested to me two other songs that I found very cool. No Doubt's song &quot;Making Out&quot; is very hip, I'm thinking I'm defiantly going to have to consider buying <u>Rock Steady</u>. OMG, my <u>BeautifulGarbage</u> CD is horribly scratched, I need to buy a new one...oh, Nick's troubles...Well, Allyson also suggested Portishead's &quot;Sour Times&quot;. That also proved to be very cool. It reminds me of &quot;Nobody Loves You&quot; by garbage. I've been in a &quot;Nobody Loves You&quot; kind of mood lately, so that was a nice song to hear.<br>
<br>
Well, not much else to say for my first entry. I had to look all over the internet for some good gay content for this site...It's hard to get the right pictures to convey to people that, &quot;Yes, I am gay.&quot; Hehehehe, it was fun looking at all the hot guys deciding who would make the cut...yeah!<br>
<br>
Oh, I wanted to write SOMETHING about the fight I had with <a href="../../friends/missy.html">Missy</a> this weekend. Summary: She ditched me and Gen in front of The Grill while we froze our asses off waiting to take her drunk ass home. She also came back to my room on Sunday at 12PM (me being a college student, I was sleeping) for her stuff, and so rudely said, &quot;uh, fuck you&quot; after I asked if she had even considered I was sleeping...well, I talked to her about it briefly, and I really wasn't satisfied with the apology. It seemed to me that she just kept on rationalizing her place on the issue and not really getting to the &quot;I'm sorry&quot;, which is all I really want...not and &quot;I'm sorry, but&quot;, or an &quot;I'm sorry, and&quot;...but a good ol' fashioned &quot;I'm sorry.&quot; I'm resolved enough on the issue to not let it get in the way of our friendship, but I'm certainly not going to forget her rudeness. All's well that end's well...DON'T LEAVE ME IN ATHENS IN THE FREEZING COLD OR I'LL REALLY GET YOU!<br>
<br>
Well, I talk alot, now it's time to ready for bed, going off to aforementioned dream world...I'll write again, buh bye!

<div class="post">
<p>Today could have possibly been a very productive, but I feel soundly adequate about it, this being 12AM Wednesday now. I got to watch my precious Buffy with my friend Thom, that was great...despite my social ineptness that often plagues me. Classes were easy, I suppose. Tuesdays usually aren't very challenging.<br>
<br>
Highlights...highlights...yes, I went grocery shopping for cinnamon bread and conversation hearts. Really nothing much then that, I'm kinda tired now though. Yawn yawn...SO going to bed soon...check out the new garbage studio diary, it's very interesting...garbage is super cool...

<p>Wow, I'm actually doing this early tonight...9 o'clock, how nice. I figured that maybe I can write more or something. Possibly the most exciting thing about today...seeing HOT possibly gay guy in my hall tonight...oh, every time I see him, I get so happy, I don't know why. It's like a crush, and crushes are SO much fun, yey!<br><br>My quest for a supreme body for Spring Break continues today. This morning I started eating Fiber One again, as my good friend <a href="../../friends/quiana.html">Quiana</a> once told me. She really is right, though most taste like horrible cardboard, it is often that you do get one that tastes like sweet honey. It's kinda like chewing gum, you have something to do while you're bored, eating--which is what alot of people do when they're bored--and you get your daily source of fiber. No more irregularity! What more could you ask for!<br>
<br>
Oh, another horrible &quot;winter&quot; day today, where I was never required to wear my beautiful leather jacket, it upsets me, yes, but I will survive... I had a very charming conversation with <a href="../../friends/dille.html">Dille</a> and <a href="../../friends/leena.html">Leena</a> tonight at dinner, which I'm very proud of. It's very nice to spend time with people you wish you could spend more time with...makes sense, yes?<br>
<br>
Well, I did alot of good things today...I told John I would help with the Homosexual Gathering Feast we will have during Welcome Week in the fall, I ran 4 miles, I did 100 crunches (eat that Rob, EAT THAT YOU FAT SLOB!), and I got to take a relaxing drive in shitmobile too, and it started, which is always GREAT! Well, so much left to work on, I think I'm going to be playing with stuff for my page all night, so that will be enjoyable. I mean, it's not like I HAVE to go anywhere, I already ran, it's time to SLACK OFF! YEAH!

<p>Had a good work out today, not so much running, but on the torture machines I did some significant work. Anthony told me something tonight that had me think...which I think was his point, to get me thinking, about death and friends and loss. A friend of his had passed away and he was a little distraught about it. I, not having lost anyone really important in my life, am really unprepared for whatever emotion may present itself during that time. It's kinda scary, but I'm glad I'm not too worried about it now...I'll just keep that in mind.<br>
<br>
I have two tests tomorrow AND a quiz, is that not awful. Sitting here, at 10:17PM, I realize I should probably study...but they're English tests, so I'm screwed either way...I figure. If I haven't read it by now, cramming it all down now won't do much good. I still feel like I should read a bit more of <u>Gulliver's Travels</u>, but I don't think cramming is a good idea. I'll probably definitely work on my Linguistics' homework though...that stuff has to be done tonight.<br>
<br>
I feel so warm, it's very cool...like, the working out makes me so warm, I like it...it's like i was just overcome with a wave of warmth...I'm hoping in a month I can have my Spring Break body. That would be nice. I'm trying to get <a href="../../friends/missy.html">Missy</a> to go to Miami with me, that would be alot of fun. We could go to all the clubs and spend time on the beach every day. That would be amazing...but we would defiantly have to budget the trip.<br>
<br>
Oh...it's so hot in the dorms tonight...Matt had to leave the door open, and I'm seeing my neighbor across the hall...VERY NICE...it's too bad he's blatantly str8. Otherwise, I would be swooning...so maybe it's a good thing he's not gay. I think he's doing art on the floor, how interesting... I'm listening to &quot;Enough is Never Enough&quot; right now, it's a very cool song. I had better jet now...studying will be involved later on, but for now, I think I'll recover a bit more from the work out...I'm such a worthless slacker...hehehehe

<p>I had a very good day today. My two tests went very well. My Linguistics homework also went very well. The teacher said that if we understood what we did last night, we were in very good shape. I UNDERSTOOD IT! That's something I don't really need to worry about, huh? Well, the quiz went well two, and afterwards, I had this sense that I was alright, that things were ok then.<br>
<br>
I worked out VERY well tonight. I ran 5 miles and did 200 crunches, INCLUDING the crunches that are SO hard to do...those are the ones were I have to pick up my legs...uck, it's torture, I SWEAR!<br>
<br>
After working out, I went out with <a href="../../friends/missy.html">Missy</a> and <a href="../../friends/gen.html">Gen</a> to get two movies...we got <u>Chasing Amy</u> and the first three episodes of &quot;The Sopranos.&quot; (Yelling of basketball players outside is obstructing my focus here...damn hot guys and their silly games with balls...how homoerotic...). They are still watching &quot;The Sopranos&quot; now, but I'm not in a watching mood, I guess. I was thinking that I would go home for the weekend, but I've just decided not to. I'll go home next weekend, when Dad comes home. This weekend...I'll run, and I'll work out...and I'll do my essays, fun fun fun...and maybe I'll publish this on Sunday. Yeah, that's enough for now...<br>
<br>
Oh, one last thing. I was really wanting to buy the &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; DVD set, but it's $89! That is way too much, but it would have been SO cool to watch...that show quasi-changed my view of gay sex...it's very cool, I HIGHLY suggest it.

<p>Today was an ok day. A healthy day. I woke up at 1 o'clock, which was nice. I like getting alot of rest. I have been tinkering with the update that I'm supposed to do tomorrow, but I think I may have it up by tonight...I'm impatient. We're watching &quot;The Sopranos&quot; again...I really wanted to rent &quot;Queer As Folk&quot;, but unfortunately it was SO popular it was rented out at the store...THAT SUCKS!<br>
<br>
Well, I guess this concludes my first week of journal entries...this is NOT what I write in my REAL journal, but it's somewhat similar, not as deep...like I'M deep, hehehe, ENJOY THE SITE!
