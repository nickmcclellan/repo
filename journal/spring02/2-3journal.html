<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, February 3rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>It 3:48AM on this Sunday morning, and already my week has started off kinda miserable. Missy and I went out to Insomnia tonight, which I thought would be a good experience, breaching the gay/str8 gap. It turned out to be VERY boring. I think that's it is because of bigger issues altogether, issues I'm not sure I'm ready to deal with...but tonight, the catalyst seemed to be Missy's drinking and her desire to really enjoy herself, which is understandable. However, it wasn't cool to just leave me in that shit-hole all by myself, that wasn't cool, and she apologized, which was good. I won't be going out next weekend, I'm pretty sure I'll be spending a nice restful weekend back at home with the 'rents.<br>
<br>
Today (whatever's left of Sunday that I DON'T spend sleeping) will be a very busy day. I need to get my ass to Ramsey and run some serious laps. I felt a tiny difference tonight, I know if I can commit to this working out I can have my spring break body and eventually a hot b/f and regular sexual intercourse...hehehe, I've got that one-track mind.<br>
<br>
I was telling Missy and Gen tonight that the one thing I always really wanted was that ONE guy that I could be complete friends with. Some guy that was loyal and loving and caring to me, one that I could spend time with, have fun with, cry with, enjoy life with, etc. The point of that whole &quot;I want&quot; rant is that he is MY FRIEND...when I was little I never remembered me wanting to BE with him or anything. That sorta thing has happened of it's own invention. I think that if I had one gay friend to really be there for me, that I would be alright...how am I supposed to get that?<br>
<br>
I think volunteering might expose me more, maybe...I don't know. I am not in desperate need for it though, it's not like I'm drowning here with him. I just know that that's what I need to feel happy, and I'm confident that it's possible, that one day, I will have it...until then, I have to write two English papers and lose these love handles...Run, Nick, RUN!
</div>

<h2 class="date-header">Monday, February 4th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>These entries just get earlier and earlier each day, it amazes me...well, I wanted to write something last night, but since I had already written my &quot;Sunday&quot; piece late Saturday night on into early Sunday morning, I decided I could write now, it being 12:16PM on Monday.<br>
<br>
My English papers were NIGHTMARES...literally! I had two separate nightmares about each of my papers. In the first one, I had forgotten to do the second paper and was scrambling to get it done in an hour's time. The second dream involved me hysterically trying to print the first paper, yet, I could not because somehow a new operating system had asserted itself onto my computer, a system which would take me too long to understand. I was so hysterical...there was actually A CLOCK in this dream, so I watched the minutes tick away as I tried unsuccessfully to get my paper printed...I don't know why I had so much anxiety over these papers, I don't need this stress!<br>
<br>
I did an EXCELLENT work out yesterday; 5 miles, 200 crunches, a new standard has been set. I am hoping I can do something like that today. There was a point yesterday when I SWEAR I knew what Hell was like. I may be unable to run 5 miles today because my left foot is a bit in pain for some reason, probably all the running I've been doing lately. I was thinking about doing weights, but I probably won't, it being Monday and all. All those frat boys and sorority girls will probably want to work off all they drank over the weekend, and I will be scrambling to find whatever torture machine is open for use. Oh well...I may do that, I may not.<br>
<br>
I have the Homosexual Gathering tonight, so hopefully that will be enlightening. I think it's going to be about the Speaker's Bureau...which I don't think is very interesting, but, to each his own, I'll listen. Now...what to do now. Since I'm done with the paper, I'm here listening to garbage. I think I can relax now...it will be a slow week, this week, followed by a trip home to see puppy and kitten...oh, what fun!
</div>

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, February 6th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I CAN'T believe that I forgot to write in this journal yesterday. I think I had other things on the mind, apparently. Well, I had OK days, I suppose. I haven't done much running since Sunday, which kinda stinks. I tried to do it on Monday night, and I started to feel very sick. I just don't think it was the time to go. Tuesday, I had to talk to my father, and I usually take a break then, so that was out. And tonight, since I hadn't worked out the muscles since...hmmm...last Friday (I think), I decided to do those. It was productive, I suppose, I felt the &quot;burn&quot;, the torture served its purpose...<br>
<br>
REST IN PEACE...BRANDY TURNS 12 TODAY, I LOVE YOU BRANDY!<br>
<br>
Today was quite a nasty day. It rained ALL DAY LONG, and it was very cold outside. It was so cold, it was necessary to wear my leather jacket, but because it was raining, I should not have worn it because water ruins the texture...what a dilemma! I had to wear my light jacket OVER my leather jacket, which wasn't very successful and I looked quite odd...ah, Nick's issues, they are so stupid, I know...I'm sure people deal with such difficult stuff OTHER then these little conflicts, but until I'm some of those people, I have to worry about ruining my leather jacket...<br>
<br>
Dinner was very enjoyable. I was very pleased to see that Missy had already gotten to O-house by the time I had gotten my food. I was so happy to see her and I really appreciated that she was there. Missy is such an amazing person...she's doing some sorority type stuff this week, which has her pretty occupied. I am torn on this whole issue. On the one hand, I know that Missy will be happy in a sorority, but on the other hand, I despise any type of Greek activity (except homosexuality, OF COURSE!), these college type Greek activities are terribly conformist and elitist. I just don't see Missy being a better person by going into an organization like this. I'm afraid I'm being selfish about this whole thing...her being in a sorority means that she could get new friends and I would be DROPPED...but I don't think Missy would do that...I certainly wouldn't do that to her. Que será, será I guess, right?<br>
<br>
Well, I suppose that's all for now...I want to go to bed early tonight so that maybe I can do some serious running in the morning. I've found that I can run longer on an empty stomach...nothing emptier then before breakfast, right? Well, adios mi amigos, &#304;Ten bein día!

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, February 7th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Well, today was an interesting day. My Critical Thinking professor kicked the whole lecture out of the room twenty minutes early because no one (proudly stated, including myself) had read the reading for the lecture. He was like, &quot;Ok, what was the third thing discussed?...What was the third thing?...ANYONE???...Did anyone here read the reading?...GET OUT!&quot; I was a little let back by the incident, but, I really don't think reading it would have helped me understand. He was like, &quot;Go away, get used to your life of failure.&quot; I really don't give a damn about this stupid class and this strange man, but I will NOT be a failure. I would not let that happen to myself.<br>
<br>
I went to the John Mayer concert tonight, which, I must say, was very cool. John Mayer struck me as very thin, like, looking like this guy Ilya that I know, thin. I was a bit surprised. He was filming his video for &quot;No Such Thing&quot;, so MAYBE I might appear somewhere in it, but it's doubtful. We stood underneath the crane, and showing the crane mechanism wouldn't be very cool in the video...but who cares, you all get to see the adorable John Mayer sing about conformity...that's enough...you don't need to see me in my leather jacket and glasses looking like a deer in headlights.<br>
<br>
My sister came up for the concert. She was a real bitch after the show. She was very selfish, wanting to go to sleep. I mean, IT WAS ONLY MIDNIGHT! She needs to learn how to stay up past her bedtime if she expects to make in partying with the college folk. I really wanted that milkshake too...but I guess SHE wouldn't let me...that bitch. I'll get her back this weekend when I head home. I get to see puppy and kitten romp and play! I CAN'T WAIT. Puppy's name is Joey now. That's cool, I guess...I liked Buddy, but at least kitten is the kitten I had originally wanted.<br>
<br>
I am upset with April, I really am. This whole new feeling I've felt growing between me and April has become this whole realization that I'm not on good terms with her. I wanted to do something with her on Saturday, but she kinda played it down like she either didn't want to or her mom would not let her, which is completely ridiculous. Her mother has some SERIOUS issues, and she is playing all submissive and passive about it, refusing to act, saying that &quot;Oh, maybe someday...&quot;, well, if she really cared for her mother, she would do SOMETHING. At least with my mother, I didn't know what was going on. I was clueless she was abusing pain killers. April knows what's up with her mother. Even when my mother started to exhibit depression before I went into college, I had a conversation about it with my father, and we both agreed that we would act if the time arrived when we needed to. It turned out my father had a HUGE problem himself, which I always knew, but was so (and still) embittered about it that I would refuse to act out of sheer resentment, and dare I say, at sometimes, hate...and fear.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to call April on Saturday. I think I might go hiking, that would be fun. I was thinking about inviting her, but she can just forget about it. I don't feel like it's April anymore. I don't know if I'm being jealous or whatever because she has found a better friend in Matt, but I don't feel like I'm valued anymore by her. I feel like I've been tossed aside or something. Like I'm there when she needs me. It's not a nice feeling. I have better friends then that. I realize that April is one of those friends, but hopefully, down the line, she'll show me that I'm valued, I know she will. If she doesn't, then I guess I'm not jealous...whatever, you know? Weekends belong to Matt, there is no room for friends, right? AM I RIGHT!<br>
<br>
Probably should get to working on my Reading Questions for a while, that would be advantageous, yes? I guess my next entry will be from the comfort of my own home...yeah, that's going to be nice. Showering without shower shoes...playing with puppy and kitten...drinking lots of milk pissing off mom...sleeping in a large bed...NOT using a public restroom EVERY TIME...and seeing the family, I guess they serve SOME purpose, yes?

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, February 9th:</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Well, I am at home now. I have an hour to prepare for the update...I have until midnight...my AOL will sign me off after midnight...so I had probably start the update at 11:30...I don't have that quick ethernet connection here, so I need to rely on worthless dial-up AOL. I just hope it doesn't kick me off.<br>
<br>
I've enjoyed my time here with puppy and kitten. Oh, it was so much fun last night playing with puppy, but I've realized that I like kitten better. I have the SWEETEST cat in the world. She is one of those petting cats. She adores attention, and she has the most amazing attitude toward humans, its so intriguing. Puppy is about as useful as a football, and just as small. Maybe when he gets bigger, he will be more interactive. Now, kitten is all needy for attention, so it's nice to give it to her.<br>
<br>
I didn't see April today, but she did call me. She called me to tell me that she didn't want to do something, but surely she wanted SOMETHING. She was the first call on my NEW cell phone...I was so upset...I guess she's worthy. She's my best friend, so why not? I offered to show her puppy, but I was really upset to hear her older dog Patches is in the Animal Hospital for a neurological disease...or something like that. I really sympathize for her on that, because Patches is an older dog, and I rememeber all those issues and fears when Brandy was getting older. At that point in an animal's life, you love them more then ever and you are afraid that your time with them is almost over. I hope that April and her family get as much time as possible, and I hope Patches will be alright.<br>
<br>
I suppose that's all for now...enjoy the update! I think I've added 4 friends, some poems, and a lyrics page. Hopefully I'll have this all up by midnight, yes? Let's hope so...
