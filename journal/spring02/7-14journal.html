<p>I've noticed lately that I am having alot of that pent up creative energy lately. I'm finding that I'm spear-heading my website more lately then I typically do. It's odd, because when I started this thing, I was so into it, and I actually made a whole different version of the site before settling on what I have now. By the time I discovered exactly how I wanted to deal with the site, I had been sucked dry of that whole creative fire, and I found myself making all these pages that I didn't want to make because I was just not into it anymore. Like, I had committed to making pages for some of my friends, but I was so sick of spending a good 20 minutes on these things because it wasn't thrilling anymore at that time.<br>
<br>
I find that now I'm being revisited by that whole trilling thing about making the page, so it's really cool. I like working on what I'm planning for when I go back to school. I have a really cool link bar and the galleries page is nice too. I'm really into what I'm planning for post-Christmas! I'm thinking of doing an 8-part webseries for my comic book character Sherry Cherry that I made up in 7th grade. I am thinking that maybe into this fall I can write and draw the comics and when I go back home for Christmas I can scan and prepare the sites to be published. Then over a few weeks in the spring I can publish them and maybe have some sort of cult following, wouldn't that be awesome! I guess I would have to stick on them that they are not to be copied without my written position, that's very important. I'll have to see, alot of things I have to work out with that. I think I'd have to do a bigger format so my chicken scratch can be read on the screen, so I'll be sure to let you all know if that's going to fly in the spring.<br>
<br>
I'm anxiously awaiting word on who my roommate is to be at UGA in the fall. I'm hoping he's going to be alittle of an improvement from my last roommate, who, I MUST say was excellent, but I'm ready for someone different. Ideally, I would like to room with someone I can relate to as more then a roommate/acquaintance. It would be awesome to have a cool friend I can do stuff with, but I'm certainly not expecting it. I'm just hoping he's going to be open minded, NOT smelly, and willing to venture out of the dorm, because GOD KNOWS I need my private time.<br>
<br>
Well, I'm working this week every morning except for Wednesday and Saturday, so I must get my sleep. I'll touch base later on if something interesting happens...doesn't look promising...damn...adios folks.

<p>Today was a pretty stressful day as far as work goes. I was working planograms all day which is pretty ok as far as Target goes, but I was doing alittle more then I was scheduled to do and I was getting alot of stress about it. Well, I finally ended up work on on the planogram I was supposed to work on today and I started just alittle late. It happened to be that I was doing a planogram in the girls department...about 10 feet away from the front registers...what probably would have taken me just an hour ended up stretching out over 4. It would seem that whenever I was just making alittle headway, I would be called up to the front, and I was SO pissed off! By the time I was finished, I was always looking over my shoulder, rushing to do whatever I could in 5 minutes before being asked to do something else, it was maddening!

<p>Oh, thank goodness, I went out and did something tonight! Missy and I went to go see Hoobastank downtown. We had a nice time but I think it would be more fun if maybe we had Gen come along, but who really cares. I just enjoyed getting out of this house on a Friday night.<br>
<br>
I just want to go off on how SHITTY some people are. Ok, this kid who was e-mailing me sometime this summer, started to e-mail me and he seemed really cool, and I honestly had no intention to date him or anything, he just seemed like someone who was dealing with his sexuality and wanted some inside info from someone who has been there, and I was happy to do it. It was the other night when he IMs me and makes it just alittle more then that, and honestly, I was bored and was into it, so yeah, I think that at that point I would have meet him and would have been open to be more then just a friend...but you know, those SHITTY warning signs were there, and you know what I'm talking about!<br>
<br>
Ok, number one...one of the first things he says to me is that if we meet could he please suck my dick...EXCUSE ME...what? Do I come off as this guy that is in desperate need of oral sex that upon first meeting you have to do this for me? I don't think so! Well...I'm like...&quot;Ok, we'll see...&quot; because honestly I wouldn't let that happen unless I was into dating him. Ok, number two, I ask him if he would ever consider coming out, and he said something along the lines of, &quot;No, this gay thing is just a phase...blah blah blah,&quot; and I think to myself, I'm SO fucking knowing this guy is trash but lets just give him a chance...I am such an idiot! Ok, well, if those two things weren't enough warning for me, me speaking to him tonight was certainly it.<br>
<br>
I IM him and just say hey, nothing at all besides a nice hello, and he's like, &quot;Look, I can't talk to you anymore...I have alot of sin in my life and today I am changing that...&quot; and I'm like...ok...ok...ok, EAT SHIT AND DIE!!! I mean, SERIOUSLY! Why are some closeted freaks such pansy ass losers and why do I want to be sweet as muffins and help them deal with these issues and just get fucked in the end? Why, could you tell me, because I don't know. Honestly, I don't care, because in the end, I have the most level head because I've dealt with my demons and have very little sin in my life and take the opportunity of being gay to be the most moral and positive person I can, so I take alot of pride in that. I just find it really sad that someone like him has to recklessly interfere with other people's lives when he is certainly the one with the problem. If you have sin in your life, it's not coming from me, it's not like I was sent by Satan to tempt you from your life of breeding and being something you're not. I'm just here looking for someone to love, and its really sad that you have to take my kindness and just wipe your ass with it and call it a sin, because that REALLY pisses me off!
