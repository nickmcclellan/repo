<p>Here I am, in Spring Break aftermath. It's not bad here. It feels good. I showed that bitch Reynolds just how powerful the word of Nick really is. Got me a pretty grade on my last test, and the essay was my most prized reward. It defiantly reflects my best efforts. This weekend, I will be doing it again, studying my ass off for her next test. I'll be ready, and this time, I'll get a 100.<br>
<br>
I am feeling so sexually charged, it's kinda embarrassing to admit. I don't know why, for crying out loud, I'm GAY! I want to go out and mix and mingle with hot guys and maybe make some foolish attempts to procreate. I really wanna! I want to go to Boneshakers and dance my little ass off and meet some little hussie and have my way with him. I'm almost torn with myself to do it. I feel like I'm doing some horrible sin in some way, some sort of subversive thought inserted by those right wing religious freaks. I am so angelic and good sometimes, it makes me sick! I was thinking to myself, a few weeks ago, that I can control this. I can be patient and repress and wait for that saviour to come along and sweep me off my feet and take me to his castle where we'll be together...NOT just for sex...and we'll be mentally one and I'll never have to date again...I keep waiting on that to happen, and continue to be my perfect 10 self...so BORING.<br>
<br>
I feel like dancing with some really hot guy I don't know, going back to his place, and just do it. I don't care anymore. Something is calling for me, deep down inside, and I can't stop it anymore. I can feed it in the wrong ways, with these lies, but it's just going to keep wanting from me what I haven't given it. I think that's why I wasn't satisfied with Jason. He was what should have stopped that in me, but he couldn't appease it. I needed something more primal then that. I am afraid that tomorrow I'll feel differently, but now, I know what it is. I'm a young guy and it's time to experience life...and make some mistakes<br>
<br>
In other news, Missy is pissed at me. Apparently I'm supposed to be able to read minds to figure out that she thinks I'm a complete slob. Not only that, she's pissed about a little shampoo in her precious Mustang. Gee...I could get that out in a jiffy. It's called a RUG CLEANING MACHINE, and she can drive her car up to my house and it will take me FIVE minutes to fix that shit. It's a neat comparison to me and Nicole's excursion to Tybee Island. I remember my car getting all messy and crap with tons of stuff, one being Nicole's bathing suit...oh! Well, I certainly didn't get into a fit about that, I wouldn't let something that PETTY get in between our friendship. I'm thinking, that if Missy is as mature as I certainly believe she is, she will not hold a grudge for the stupid, childish reason of me not giving into her empty attempts to sell out to some cheap college stereotype of loose moral girls dancing with mindless drones at some shit-hole club in some lame courtship ritual that ends up with a one-night-stand...which she vows never to do. Hopefully my rant will not upset anyone, but it's raw, and it's real. I love Missy to death and I would never do anything to upset her, and I know that if she is my friend, she'll realize this, and she will want to get over this. If not, then so be it.<br>

<p>Well, I got to talk to Missy, or should I say NOT talk to Missy. It seems like she wants to forget about it. I guess I can deal with that, but it makes me really uncomfortable. I really wanted to come to some sort of understanding on any Spring Break fallout that we had accumulated. I'm trying not to get really close to Missy, I don't want to upset her again like apparently I have before. It makes me uneasy around her too, which I guess is alright. Not spending oodles of time with her has actually been a good thing for me. I've been very isolationist this week, except for Wednesday.<br>
<br>
Wednesday night I went to Boneshakers for the first time in months, and that whole thirst for some sort of excitement was somewhat quenched. I got to dance wildly with a bunch of gay guys and just got reintroduced into a world I want to be apart of. It was an amazing experience, and I have my great friend Rachel to thank for it. She invited me along, and that was very sweet of her. Sometimes I don't feel like I have any friends in this area of life, so I feel very alone when going to a place like that, so it was nice to have Rachel there with me to reacclimatize me to that atmosphere.<br>
<br>
I'm now suiting up this weekend for Round 3 with Reynolds. This time, I'm going for perfect 10 and I KNOW I can do it. Round 1, she thought I was down for the count, Round 2, I struck back at those dorky eggheads (biggest victory was overlooking their charismatic leader's grade was a 60) and Reynolds was impressed with my writing form and structure. Round 3, KNOCK OUT! Go Baby, Go Baby GO!
