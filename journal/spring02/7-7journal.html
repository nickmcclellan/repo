<p>Today, I finally got my laptop back. The annoying times when the laptop would go into a coma turned out to be something that needed to be sent away to get fixed. I wasn't without it for that long, thankfully. I've been doing really well these last few weeks. My week of hell is somewhat of a distant memory. I have saved $600 so far towards the repair, and two weeks from now i'm going to send the check away so I will have no balance. YAH!<br>
<br>
I'm getting excited about going back in the fall to UGA. Recently I got the South Parking deck, can you believe it! This means I am parking right next to my dorm next year, I'm such a spoiled brat. I can't wait for that first day back in the dorms when I'm going to be alittle more at home because I actually have some great friends in the area now. I will be moving in on August 14th, and I anxiously await that day.<br>
<br>
I'm planning on a big update before going back to school. A complete change of theme, and it's going to be something non-garbage. That's good, right? I need to add a new section for pictures, and that means I will be needing a new icon...which I don't have...grrrrr. I'm going for a hand-written theme, actually. I'm thinking of scanning a high-quality piece of recycled paper and then drawing a really sharp navigation bar. Hopefully this will all come out how I plan...let's hope. Well, that's all for now...hope someone enjoys hearing from me....ADIOS!

<p>I'm in my pitch black room on my bed typing the last journal for the week...it's quite a site, I can assure you. I had a pretty so-so day, boring, and ultimately pointless. Why do I feel so lifeless and ordinary when I'm at home? Is it because my Dad is a prick and I should have left him rotting in California? Is it because I do nothing but work to pay off the repair costs on the Mazda? I don't understand, I am a young, good-looking guy, shouldn't I be out having fun and breaking hearts? Isn't it funny how what seems to be on the outside isn't quite what it is on the inside?<br>
<br>
I sometimes wonder what I look like from the outside. I think sometimes I ignore what I really am because I'm scared...scared at what I've become. I think that maybe I can see what I am now, but I just refuse to accept it or assure myself that I'm going to change...next year...next year...this summer...this fall, sometime. Maybe, the sad depressing truth is, I won't change. I'm this for life. I'm just going to be bored and working forever and ever and never have anyone besides the strange people I come across on the internet that want to &quot;bone&quot; me. What is that supposed to do for me? Does it make me happy?<br>
<br>
I certainly know what I want. I want, in less then a year, to spend less time in my dorm room and more time out in Athens. I want to have found someone that is so cool that I can spend time with him and just feel so charged and alive. I want to find someone that I can be sardonic with and he can just see right through that whole crap to the tense nervous kid beneath. I want college to be less about school and more about moving away from where I am sitting now...in my father's house. I want my life to be less ordinary. Is this what everyone else wants or have I just said something so profound, you just want to publish it immediatly!<br>
<br>
I can answer that question. But how am I going to go about making the coming year what I really want and need it to be? I have several ideas, of course, that I must have to courage to go about making into reality. First of all I need to go out and meet more people...people like myself, not people I can be comfortable with. I am also going to try to busy myself with things outside of my little room. I am hoping to stick to a very aggressive training schedule at Ramsey. This will include running on Tuesdays and Thursdays and weight training on Monday/Wednesday/Friday. I also plan on going to alot of interesting talks around campus with the Honors program. I want to spend more time with Vicki too, I want her to be a bigger part of my college self because she represents a part of me that I really need to exude more often. Like Nicole, she makes me what to venture out and be more then what I settle on. I know having her in my life is a blessing. Of course, with all these things, I will be treating school with more respect and studying regularly. I am also hoping to spend more time with John to, going out to No Cover at Boneshakers, because interesting things ALWAYS happen then. I swear, I have only gone to No Cover a handful of times, and of those times, 3 of them I ended up dancing really close to someone, which for me, is a big thing.<br>
<br>
A boyfriend would be nice next year, but that's one thing I can't control. Love life, that's something that's secondary to everything else. It's something, like a cat, that sleeps in your heart and comes beckoning when it's found something it likes. Your tummy rumbles, and you want THAT one, and once you have him, you can feel a bit of balance. A b/f would go a long way to helping fix alot of my most negative parts of me. I have alot of jealousy I think that I keep hidden. It's bad, but it's something everyone deals with and it's very personal and very wrong. I'm sorry!<br>
<br>
Well, my MP3 is about to end and I have to wake up in about 4 hours to work my ass off all over again. I am hoping that maybe someone reads this update and is pleased to hear alittle of my late night soul-searching. Below I have inserted a picture of what my new navigation bar will look like in the update when I go back to UGA. Tell me what you think!</p>
