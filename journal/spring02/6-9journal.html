<p>Summer is still going...slow, hot, and sometimes boring. It would be cool if I got to work alittle more. Target has been a real bitch about the hours. I'm really agitated that I'm not working at least 25 hours a week, it's ridiculous! I'm such a dedicated worker, and they can't even give me a decent 8 hour shift on a Saturday, what is up with that??? Well, I'm holding all this rage in for now. I was considering making a nice job shift before the end of the summer to make some more money, but I don't think that's possible for me. However, I will be working very hard to get some work in Athens this coming semester. I am very excited about getting an apartment the year after this and finally moving out from under my parents roof. Not sure how that will pan out though...<br>
<br>
I am continuing to spend time with my cousin. Yesterday we took my Dad's La-Z-Boy to get repaired and ate at Ruby Tuesdays. OMG, we talked about acne, it was gross, but I quickly changed the subject. We talked alittle about my sister's hopeless future, how she would be more likely to drown her sorrows with a bottle of Vodka while me and Laura would probably deal with it in more appropriate ways. Oh, as seen from my anti-Jen nature, it's obvious we had a confrontation...<br>
<br>
Last night, I came home after work, and I was just a bit agitated. You see, last week, I would be at home (you know, not at Target because of lack of hours) and I would be on the internet talking to some of my friends, and Jen would walk in and expect me to get off, and I would for her. I realize that she has important people to talk to on the internet, and I expect to receive the same courtesy from her. However, for the past week, she has just stayed on the net until around 1AM or later, and I get on to see that anyone I want to talk to has logged off...and that just really pissed me off. I was really wanting to talk to some of my online buddies on Friday and Saturday because I wasn't doing a damn thing interesting all day...just work...and I get home and Jen takes all the prime online time, and I wanted to get some myself, Monday night, and I wasn't going to wait. I told her to get off the internet or I was going to make her get off...and I got her into an argument and she basically said she didn't respect my right to have time on the internet, and that was all I needed to hear. I pulled out the cord, and she went semi-balistic. She always tries to pull the maturity card when we argue, it's getting old. I'm alot more mature then her, and I really have been giving her time on the net, and I wasn't going to just roll over and take it anymore...I stood up for myself and told her how I felt. She tried to hit me, which is just really pathetic and so not mature, she's like, &quot;Don't get in my face...&quot; and I certainly wasn't in her face, I was just telling her how incredibly ridiculous it is to cry immature everytime she doesn't get her way with me...oh, and the funniest part was when she said that she was smarter then me, which is certainly not the truth. She can conceal her secret life and run away from this one all she wants, but sooner or later, she's going to have to face the fact that her problems just won't fly out of her window.<br>
<br>
Well, instead of going to Myrtle Beach, we went to Tennessee on our camping trip. It was alot of fun, aside from our little trip in the canoe. Jen and Laura were interested in taking a canoe trip in a river or lake, and insisted that I find out about it and find out where we could rent a canoe. I do so, finding an excellent, fairly inexpensive place where we could take a nice and scenic trip down a 9 mile stretch of river. However, once we got out on the river, 9 miles was just too much for Laura and Jen...both refused to go any further then where the Outfitters dropped us off. Both wanted to throw their oars down and quit, but I wouldn't let it happen. I picked up an oar and rowed, and Laura did too, which was great. Jen was a real bitch about it, just wanting to sit back and let everyone else do the work, it's so like her. We got to 4 miles and both Jen and Laura got out to get back to the outfitters. I continued ahead, determined to finish what I had started out to do. It was very metaphorical, you know. Jen would rather quit or opt for the free ride, but I wouldn't let her. She had to row as a team or not at all. You either pick up an oar or hit the road. Get over yourself Jen, no one else will.<br>
<br>
Well, that's all update for now. April's still obsessing over Matt...Nicole and I are training for a 10K...Laura's family and whole world is falling apart and she's coping...I'm still SINGLE....FUCK NO! Well, actually, there are these few people on the net that IMed me that seem pretty cool, but I won't explore that unless I feel like it will really work...I need to get to know them more then I got to know J'son...it's only appropriate...it would be great to get laid this summer...HAHAHA! Adios folks!
