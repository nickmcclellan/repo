<p>Oh, I have had quite an exhausting 3 days overnight with that girl Suzanne. Oh, I think this morning was the absolute worst. Ok, ok, it was basically this girl who just seems to think I'm just a complete base-head idiot. I mean, she's going off thinking she's some SHIT at Target, and that's supposed to make her this big shot superior, and I really don't appreciate the condescending nature from her, it really just pisses me off. Ok, let me try to explain...<br>
<br>
I think the instance that sticks out for me the most would have to be when I was just trying to talk to her, you know, CONVERSATION. We were listening to the radio and the Incubus song &quot;Warning&quot; came on, and I commented that the video for &quot;Warning&quot; was alot like this Radiohead video I'd seen. She commented, &quot;Wow, you must watch alot of TV...&quot;, and I was like, &quot;Um...yah, well, I don't know if that was it...&quot; I had read somewhere or heard somewhere that the videos were alike, but it isn't like I spend all my time in front of the TV...at this point, she said, &quot;You know, you're exactly the type of person I hate...&quot; She went off on how much more shit she has to deal with then me and how I shouldn't flaunt my advantages in front of her.<br>
<br>
Ok people, at what point did any advantages I have become something I could control? And at what point do you think I would try to cut her down by bragging about all that I have that she doesn't? It was probably when I was leaving that I realized how much of a complete idiot she is...that's so rude of her to say to me! She must think I'm some complete asshole or something, because there is no way I would ever do that to anyone. I tried to explain to her that I too have been in situations like that. I know alot of people that have alot more then me, but at no point do I ever use that against them personally. I realized they have no control over that and as long as they're not asses about it, I can deal. I can think of several instances when people told me about something that I could have harbored jealousy toward, but I didn't let it get to me, I just smiled and said, &quot;That's wonderful!&quot; And I wasn't using any of my advantages in anyway to make her feel inadequate...I was simply trying to have a nice conversation...obviously SHE needs to work on her speaking skills and less on her &quot;being a complete BITCH&quot; skills...<br>
<br>
Well, earlier this morning, we were talking to the LOD's about our progress, and she mentioned something about a bunch of stuff we got that morning to set that we had not planned on and would consequently not have enough time for. She mentioned that we had taken apart a belt display and that was something that was part of the new set. Brian told us, &quot;Oh, we better get that set...&quot; and I immediately wanted to tell him that it wouldn't be possible, but Suzanne, reading this is something that &quot;YOU HAVE to do OR ELSE!&quot; went ahead and told them it would be done. Ok, and after I spoke to her about this later on in the morning, she went off on, &quot;I guess you just don't understand alot about this place...this job...I have to work every week of the year and deal with this all the time while you go off to your school...blah blah blah...WAAA...WAAA...BOO-HOO!&quot; Excuse me cry-baby, but tell it to someone WHO CARES! I'm really sorry that you don't have the BALLS to tell the manager that he's crazy if he thinks you can finish what you can't, because the last time I remember, telling THE TRUTH was never something that was against the rule. Ok, Ms. Suzanne, I've been at Target going on 3 YEARS! Please don't tell me I don't know what goes on around here. I tell you what, if you are ever in a position like this, it's like, all you want to do is walk out the front door and drive off and just say &quot;FUCK OFF!&quot;, but as I remember, at least, Suzanne already said that to me.<br>
<br>
Uck, I can probably go on forever about this crap, but I really shouldn't. For alittle while, it was alright. She was nice most of the time, but on the whole, I know she's just going to go off on how stupid I am when really she doesn't know what she's doing. One day, cutting corners is going to get her in a real big mess, and I would love to see that...I would LOVE IT!

<p>Oh, some follow up on the Suzanne issue. I went into work yesterday morning and a whole lotta people were fuming about a particularly poor set of a certain BELT WALL that will have to be done. I told Lily that though I worked hard overnight on this, it was SUZANNE that called the shots and the issue should be discussed with her. It was very empowering to see that things really do work out.<br>
<br>
Well, my sleep schedule continues to spin out of control in limbo. I was awake yesterday for almost 24 hours and when I finally got home I just fell into a very deep sleep. Today seems to be shaping up the same way, but by the end of the week I should be complete adjusted to a reasonable sleep pattern...just in time for going back overnight for 40 hours...makes sense, DOESN'T IT???<br>
<br>
Oh, I'm really crazy, I'm so crazy, I'm like alittle really excited about doing something that's really creepy...GHOSTHUNTING, and I make it sound so bad, BUT IT'S NOT! It's basically going somewhere very spiritual like a cemetery or a haunted place and just inviting any spirits to &quot;share an experience.&quot; I don't know what's wrong with me, but I've always kinda yearned for an experience like this. Ever since I was a little guy, I was so afraid of the dark and especially those things in the dark, like ghosts (and mostly aliens), and it's almost like an unmasking. I think that maybe working overnight is mystifying me into this paranormal obsession, I don't know. I asked Missy if she wanted to come do it with me, but she made a good point why she wouldn't want to, and I can respect that. I asked April, and I probably got a yes, but I don't know, I don't feel as close to April anymore, and don't really feel like doing stuff with her. I could ask Nicole, but I don't know...she's so crazy, she might just do it, but it could just push a button with her and she might be offended. I am thinking, Lily said she would go with me before I went back to school, and I would do it with her and she's had some experience with it and I would feel more at ease with someone that has done it then going off and striking it on my own. I'll just let it be and maybe I'll find something else to spend my time on.<br>
<br>
The legacy of my Week of Hell is finally over. I have saved enough money to pay off my car repair and I am now back in the green. My money woes, which have been fading in recent weeks, are finally a distant memory. Happily, I think I'm going to be fine. I'm already thinking of what I will be purchasing for myself in these few weeks...I'm thinking nice things like clothes and dorm room stuff. Hehehe...<br>
<br>
Not much left to say kids. I think I might call Heedok today, pray that he has a microwave.

<p>Well, no microwave, but who care, you know? I can afford a microwave.<br>
<br>
I'm feeling the impending move have alittle effect on me. Looking at my room here at home, I realize I'm going to have to move all this shit down into my car. I'm wondering which posters I should bring...definitely the beautifulgarbage rose and the other one I got from Junkman's. I will be leaving April's poster behind. It's gonna suck getting all this shit in my car. Grrr...<br>
<br>
Yesterday I wrote in my REAL journal for the first time since spring semester. That's kinda a big thing, it means I am having some things I don't feel comfortable sharing on this electronic thing. I hope I can do it more though, as much as I love just typing things so fast here, it's so cool to open up that thing and read about how I felt back in Senior year and around the whole Greg phase, it's so cool! I think there's alot of things I can learn about that stuff, and I really appreciate that I continue to write in it. GET A JOURNAL PEOPLE!<br>
<br>
Well, not sure what to say now, thought I'd have alot to write but I guess not. This is the second to last update before the big update. Let me know if you want a preview...you know...if ya wanna...hehehe, adios chicos, I'll be seeing you real soon!
