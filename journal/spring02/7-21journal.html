<div class="post">
<p>I had a very different week this week. Target scheduled me 40 hours overnight and I must admit, it was an interesting experience. Aside from fucking up any normal sleep patterns I acquired over the summer, I had a very volatile run with this girl at work I thought was a cool person...but it turns out she's a major pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
Well, here is how it started. Three of us were working on some toddler shoe endcaps that required 36 bins of shoes with, get this, 36 labels! Well, being a very smart person myself, I had no problem setting this fairly easy 6x6 endcap, but it turns out that Suzanne, the major bitch, had some issues. She set the thing like this...the Bottom Row had 6, 2nd had 7, 3rd had 6, 4th had 6, 5th had 5, and 6th had 6...what is wrong with this? Perhaps I wouldn't have noticed it if I didn't have to put up a shoe that belonged on the second row, but I noticed the problem and I asked Suzanne about it. She took it as some sort of personal attack against her, and she said to me when I told her that she had set it wrong, &quot;Are you going to fix it?&quot; And I was just a little bit angry at that...why should I fix what she fucked up? She then said to me, something really fucked up, she was like, &quot;Well then FUCK OFF...&quot; and that was it...EXCUSE ME, I am not being an ass about this, I just think that if we are setting new aisles in shoes that are supposed to be used for a good few months, we should do it right the FIRST TIME. After that little exchange, my opinion about Suzanne had really changed. She's so touchy and she takes things the wrong away. Instead of taking responsibility for her actions, she gets really pissed that someone says something bad about her work. That was definitely the end of any respect I held for her.<br>
<br>
Well, not much went on besides that. This coming week I'm working two overnights and 4 regular days. Just two more full scheduled weeks and I'm gone...I can't wait. Still have to call Heedok...maybe tomorrow. I am really hoping he's not a dorm body because I will get really pissed off if he never leaves the dorm...NO PRIVACY! Anyways, adios folks!
