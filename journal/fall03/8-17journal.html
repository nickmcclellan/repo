<p>Wanted to do that fun "Got-Nothing-Better-to-Do-Than-Write-in-My-Blog" thing. So Missy and Gen came by tonight. That was alot of fun. Having the three of us together in one room is just perfect. It's like I've always said. They are my heart.</p>
<p>Saw Dina for the first time since Graduation today. She's looking amazing. For the next while, I'll be making sure her transition from Xavier to UGA is as comfortable as possible. I showed her Ramsey today and suggested that she get involved with some of the classes they offer there. I think I did an excellent job making her feel welcomed. Tomorrow, I'll try and give her more of a walking tour...if I'm not too busy with the Lambda shit.</p>
<p>Yah, and boy does that shit hit the fan tomorrow. I kinda organized the meeting tomorrow. I hear that Eric was supposed to be in charge of it, but tonight, kinda feels like we're running into the dark here, cause I haven't heard anything from him about plans and such. I basically got in touch with everyone and made sure we met tomorrow and had a general idea on how things should run. I feel so proud. Gettin' those "I-Do-More-Than-You-So-Now-I-Can-Be-Lazy" feelings. Wow, these "Got-Nothing-Better-to-Do-Than-Write-in-My-Blog" and "I-Do-More-Than-You-So-Now-I-Can-Be-Lazy" things are just so amazing, I should just jump on my bed for hours, being all crazy with glee and fulfillment...</p>
<p>Um, yah, anyways, come to the meeting tomorrow. It will be fun.

<p>The first meeting went alright. I kinda wish more people would have shown up though. Oh well, I'm trying to get the Board to do some more flyering, hope that works out...</p>
<p>I got really moody after the meeting, after dinner and coffee even. My car is acting up, and as some people may realize, this makes me incredibly upset. Now, not only am I trying to start on the right foot w/ classes, I'm having to rack my brain with how to fix that piece of SHIT once more. I talked to my dad this morning on the way to school, he seemed confident that it was either a bad tank of gas or maybe the electrical system is having trouble holding a charge. These things sound kinda simple to fix, so I may be looking at $100, hopefully. I can handle that. At least my fears that it may be the transmission are unfounded...grrrr, you have no idea how stressful the ride home TODAY is going to be.</p>
<p>I've seen all my classes. It seems the goal for this semester will be to READ. I'll say it now: I want all A's. You know this WF and W shit needs to stop. I'm feeling kinda lost lately too. It just seems like I'm not good at anything, that I'm still lacking that career drive and such. I'm scared to death that I'm going to get a degree and be working at a place like Taco Mac for the next 3 years until I finally wise up, if it's not too late. Alas...where's a break when you need one?</p>
<p>Tonight, I'll have internet at the place. I'm in the office now, had a few random visitors today, started to feel like "home" again. I even talked to John! I feel like leaving right now for home, but I believe I told Marilia to meet me here after she got books, so I think I'll wait on her for a bit. I don't know, I feel like relaxing and studying at home tonight. Wouldn't that be better anyways? Maybe I can do some shopping w/ Marilia and I'll help her w/ her bed.</p>
<p>Oh, my life just seems so busy now-a-days...I think I'm looking for something old and meaningful to appear before me to remind me of something I forgot. Something I'd like to forget that I can't help but hold on...</p>
<p>...and what's up w/ that Power Ranger shit? Yah, you know I saw that in the theater...so, yah...um, it was alright...i liked it :-/

<p>Oh, I feel so smart. I set up the wireless internet in my apartment all by myself :-D I think the breakthrough was realizing that I had to unplug the cable modem in order for the high speed connection to recognize my computer. After that, it was following some simple directions and also that I needed to unplug the modem AGAIN for the router to be recognized. I was just on a roll tonight, but this all took way too much time, but it was worth it. Chatting on the internet in the kitchen was a joy that I have lived too long without.

<p>Boneshakers was a circus as usual. I don't think I've seen THAT many faces together in a long time. Nothing really messed w/ my head, more of a lack of messy head that's got me all bored and hungry. Anyways, I saw a CERTAIN PERSON from high school. I've decided I won't reveal him just yet, but I was just in this shock about it afterward, but, I mean, COME ON, who DIDN'T know?!</p>
<p>I need to go to bed. 9:30 class in the morning. And I'm out here in HIGHLAND...yah, we'll see if I can make it. Call me.</p>

<blockquote><center><i>"Woke up this morning to discover that the box elder bugs who were responsible for the orgy last weekend came back during the night and left a whole batch of their disgusting little orange eggs on my window screen. I will be calling pest control as soon as I'm done writing this entry. I'm not having any of that. They fill me with uncontrollable rage. I'm not exactly sure why but I want to take a flamethrower to them..."</i> ~Shirley Manson's Blog</center></blockquote>
<p>I'm sorry, but that made me smile this afternoon, I had to put it here. It was Shirl's Blog that got me into this whole obsessive journal writing thing. When they were recording beautifulgarbage, I read every entry. I especially liked the one when Shirl called Christina Aguilera a cunt...I bet you MISSED that one, losers.</p>
<p>Very busy Thursday. I have been spearheading this whole flyering initiative for Lambda. I feel that it's very important to increase meeting participation. I know I've mentioned this before, it just seems like I've been doing so much, and I want to do this, I just wish some of my colleagues felt the things I am doing for the organization were as important as I feel they are. I suppose you can say everyone is inclined to their own course of action, but if they had SOME idea of what's important and some initiative to do it, that would be fine too. We seem to be moving though.</p>
<p>Last night I saw <i>Back to the Future</i> with Matt. I love that movie. I want to see the sequel with Matt now. It's very good, their perception of the future is really wild. The ending is very good. "Great Scott!"</p>
<p>This weekend I may attempt to be a home body and actually do some reading. Tonight, though, I'm going to the movie night. We'll probably leave there early for April's party. Then, we may try Boneshakers (it's one very fun drag show tonight!)</p>
<p>One thing before I go. I have the coolest t-shirts. If you don't believe me, you will. Everytime I wear one, I always get a compliment, or a comment. Tonight, it's 1UP Mushroom night. Let's see what they say. SO glad I got a washer and dryer, now people can actually SEE my shirts.

<div class="post">
<p>I'm exhausted now. I guess I've had a very busy weekend, partying and such. Tonight we did this movie/cookie night. I was an excellent host, we had some very nice people over. Everyone had a great time.</p>
<p>Last night I went to April's party and actually made it to Boneshakers. I was very drunk, and ended up losing one of my contacts, which means I will have to wear glasses for a while. Oh well. I'll live. I'm titling this week "Green M&M's" because of a nice sexy game Missy and I came up with. We made out last night while swapping green M&M's between our mouths. Maybe if she didn't SPIT her M&M on the floor, it would have been sexier. We're trying to make this semester as raunchy as possible. Here's to that.</p>
<p>Goodnight folks.
