<p>It's official, I throw the best parties EVER! You can not IMAGINE all the crazy ass shit that when on last night. Just when I thought the party was over, that shit went on until the wee hours of the morning. I don't know where to start, I really don't. I guess we can start when Evan and Jason came over with Matt and I was all embarrassed because birthday boy and girl hadn't arrived with their posse. I am sure they didn't think I was too lame though. Anyways, they went back over to pre-party at April's while I stayed around here and greeted all my other guests. Jeremy was the only one who actually BYOLed, so yah, I'm going to have to figure that out better next time around. Cheap asses (EXCEPT FOR JERM THOUGH!) >:O</p>
<p>So yah, all these people are in my house and I'm running around making sure everyone is pleased, and everyone is drinking and having a good time. Mary-Kate had to leave early though :-( She came back later at least. It seemed like things would wrap up around 1 a.m., Chris and co. seemed to be off to Bones, but people stuck around...</p>
<p align="center"><i><b>April Shout-Out of the Day</b>: Sounds good, feels even better ;-)</i></p>
<p>Anyways, April is fun, she stuck around a while. She brought alot of folds to the party. So many people...it's a small world. Liz was hilarious, and apparently she's fighting over a guy with this OTHER girl (not sure if I should mention too much). Anyways, I sorta know the guy (I know his brother). It was just weird...</p>
<p>Well, I would go into all the slutty details, but I realize this is not the place to do it, so I will go into WORDS involved, and you're just going to have to talk to me later about all the juicy details. Ok, here we go! Naked ladies, body shots, salty boobs, making out, oral sex (all varieties), cops >:( , semen, closed doors, first and sloppy seconds, and lastly, but certainly not LEAST, THREESOME. Yes, fun times. I wasn't involved in the orgy, and apparently people that were involved in the orgy (that everyone already knows about) would prefer I not continue to proliferate their names. So yah, DENIAL! You think they'd be proud of a night of hot sex, right? If you're sorry you didn't come, it's alright. I was open to just about anyone coming, so please come next time. I won't hate :-)</p>
<p>BTW, I updated my garbage page. It's bitching. <a href="../../pages/garbage.html">Click here</a> to see it, and you BETTER go see it. Like it said, it's a little bit of alright ;-)</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>Who knew that orgies could be so complicated? Also, one more thing. Another odd party fun thing was Liz walking into my room BUTT-NAKED giving me a hug. I saw her today and she said my face was just priceless...yah, parties are fun...

<p>Updated my Poems Page. <a href="../../poems/index.html">Click here</a> if you are curious. Odds are you aren't, I've noticed not many people go to the Poems Page. Oh well, it's probably the reason my website exists at all. Actually, the Friends Page is more likely the reason the website exists at all. I didn't have enough room in my AIM profile to make shout-outs to all my friends, so I used FrontPage to make a web version of the shout-outs to appease everyone. Yah, impressed with the capabilities FrontPage offered me, I went from there.</p>
<p>A little history...</p>
<p>Today is MY Mental Health Day. I woke up this morning and decided not to go to school today. At all. I've been in my p.j.'s for most of the day. I finished my poetry submission for ENGL4800. For now, I think I'll nap for the hell of it, possibly making it to the Lambda meeting. Does it matter? No one seems to have missed me, I have recieved no calls. Oh well, unlovable me will be dreaming of you, for now.

<div class="post">
<p>I really want to get drunk and party. I don't know why, this whole day I've been thinking about stuff, and as the day comes to a close, I guess I've come to the realization that I have not had a drink in so long that I'm beginning to look back on the activity very fondly. Oh, remember Gen's party...yes, cops came to that party and didn't leave a present like the one I had Saturday. I was pleasantly buzzed and could give a hoot about the po-po. I miss the conversations...the not caring...my attitude, all of it, I want to get drunk with all my favorite people and tell them a whole bunch of things about them and then laugh about it. Oh, what will I do...</p>
<p>So I wrote in the purple book tonight. Yah, the real journal...it's been a while...since Aiman's party last spring actually. Yah, good times. I'll never finish that thing. Anyways, I was watching the Sunday Night Sex Show tonight and there was this guy that called in about how he had contracted HIV and had given it to three people within a week. He was crying and everything and Sue was being really empathetic and everything, it was kinda creepy because my first reaction to the thing was to yell at the idiot. How the hell could you be so careless? He seemed suicidal, it was really depressing. Afterward, Sue took a call about a sex crazed woman who's boyfriend had just ended things because she was too "greedy." God, I can't sleep...maybe I shouldn't sleep all day.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>April Shout-Out of the Day</b>: 4 out of 5 pimps agree...nobody's got poo-tang like April :-D <br>
(The 5th pimp was gay >:O )</i></p>
<p>I was taking a nap and Matt called in the middle of one of my hallucinations. Apparently I saw a spider climb into the air behind my garbage poster. I freaked out and started hitting my garbage poster. I was almost killed when it came crashing down, knocking my crossbow off the wall which fired away from me (thankfully) and knocked down my sexy Hoobastank CD. Oh, what was I thinking...I mean, the house is spiderful, but it was pitch black and in my room and I didn't have my glasses on. Oh, Nick...</p>
<p>So yah, I'll talk to you tomorrow, when I'm good and ready.</p>

<p>This is just an excuse for, well, you know...</p>
<p align="center"><i><b>April Shout-Out of the Day</b>: Mona Lisa is to art as the April is to the devine booty</i></p>
<p>Also, a shout out to my dumbass pedestrian friends. Why is it that when you drive you're suddenly aware of everything around you, but when you walk you can look off into space, unaware of anything around you, like a bike speeding up beside you. Um, get a clue, bipeds.</p>

<p>First thing's first...new Sherry Cherry is up. This one looks tons better than the others. Yah, it's not actual size, I made it big and shrunk it. The detail thus looks really good, but I swear, it's just a side effect of the shrinking process. Anyways, certainly you've noticed that this one is inspired...but whatever, I've noticed people respond better to the inspired comics. I just want to say that I do the Sherry Cherry comics simply because it is a very wacky way for me to satisfy my creative energies. If it weren't for Sherry, there would be no website in the first place! This was explained to you in my first journal entry, so don't give me any shit, do you understand me >:(</p>
<p>So yah, Bones was fun. Wow, how I love people. I stayed really late despite my test this morning. The place closed and I was still there, what's up w/ that? Yah, so good times, all these people talking about my party, it was wonderful! Apparently there is a buzz I throw good parties. So yah, I'm the new John Lynch. Scary.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have Spanish to do...if I don't get an A in that class, I don't know what the hell is wrong with this world. I've never done so much homework in my life, I swear...</p>
<p>...ONE MORE THING, because I hate doing homework...title is "Flagpole Sittin'" for reasons I care not to discuss. So, um...it's a song...I think I talked about the term w/ Stefanie at some point...it means fencing an issue...and yah, resolution is implied? I don't know, it's not like I write this shit. Anyways, my website has now 3000 hits! Oh, I grow more popular each day! Sure the Blog hit 3000 hits maybe a month ago, but I can't help it if you all are PSYCHOS and stalk me. Leave me alone already.</p>

<p>Ok, let's end this once and for all.</p>
<p align="center"><i><b>April Shout-Out of the Day</b>: Baby, you're beautiful, there's no doubt about that</i></p>
<p>Ah...relief...the creative stresses are lessening. Anyways, costume party tonight. Hopefully fun, if not, eh, whatever. Daniel and Kristin are fun people. Can't wait.
