<p>The Dance was last night. Yee-haw.</p>
<p>Stef did a great job :-D I got thanked right after she was thanked, I don't think I deserve that. Sure I put into motion the bureaucratic bickering that brought about the dance, but I'm sure Milo would have done that too...of course. I have been thinking about it, and maybe Matt and I didn't do so well on the music. We could have done better, maybe communicated more w/ Stef and Milo about what was going to happen when. I was very pissed when Alexia stated saying during the drag competition, "NO, next song...we need a better song..." What did she expect! We weren't told to make drag competition music! Whatever...</p>
<p>Boneshakers afterwards was surprisingly pleasant. I haven't been on Saturday for the longest time. I talked to lots of people and tried very hard to hook Stef up. Last night certainly wasn't a time for the broken hearted as everyone was up and moving, it was nice.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I had less memorable dreams last night. Good for me :-) Dreams are nice though, I had one the other night that was incredibly soothing. I wonder if it's possible to share a dream with someone? Wouldn't that be cool if you were dreaming of someone and they had the same dream, and you both understood eachother so perfectly--but you'd never know it because you didn't believe it was possible. Well, I think it's possible.

<div class="post">
<p>I have had an amazing day today! Seems that my "hard" work in American Modernism has been rewarded with an A. I got a 90 on my English midterm. McAlexander went on for almost 20 minutes on how a bad grade on the midterm should encourage students to consider dropping the class. He read a few of the essays aloud (mine was not included) and I became nervous because all of them were very heavy and LONG! I only had 25 minutes to write the damn thing, did he expect a research paper?! I didn't even have the poems next to me!! I was really sweatin'.</p>
<p>The test was handed back and I had expected to flip through the first few pages of the identifications and the essay and come to the grade at the end of the exam...but unbeknownst to me, the grade was circled on the first page. 90. I called my mom and dad and told them of my accomplishment (and slipped in moaning about my car, a necessity). Hopefully I'll have a new set of wheels in my driveway for my birthday (doubtful, but eventually, it will happen).</p>
<p>Along with my 90 on my Spanish composition, this semester seems to be progressing quite nicely, not that I'm surprised. Fall semester has ALWAYS been easy for me, I typically take fun classes and am refreshed enough to handle new difficulties. It's the spring that I usually find most difficult--burn out sucks, especially after this last spring's depressing turn of events. Sometimes, I think last spring has never ended. More often than not, I wonder what things would be like if things happened differently then.</p>
<p>I have my first meeting tonight. It's Alcohol/Drug awareness. It's a warm up for my meeting in November, which will be amazing. I'm having an author come. It's right up my alley as I'm an English major. I believe doing meetings that interest the directors responcible is key to making Monday nights successful. Here's to success.</p>
<p>I really wish I had more to say, but I don't. I am revising "Separation" for a submission/literary night purposes, also to acquire entry into the poetry version of ENGL4800. That would be great. I think I may run of now to do some creative writing. I don't get much time to do that. Blue Sky would be nice...anyways, I'll be sure to post anything good. Later folks.

<p>Put a fork in it, I think it's done.</p>
<p>My computer may finally be dead and gone. It wouldn't start yesterday and I figured as soon as I plugged it into the wall it would start working again...but it didn't. I scrambled through my room looking for any way to fix my computer, I even bugged April about getting a screwdriver again so I could get inside and see if maybe a piece of dust had taken hostage my computer. Sometime before 1 this morning, I realized I couldn't do anything...then. This morning, I took it to GC Computers at the Athens mall, it will probably be there before the lady calls me up to inform me what I already know.</p>
<p>I have a shit computer. I am trying to call my mom to see if she'd help me finance a new laptop, but we'll see. I was really upset last night, but this afternoon, I realized that it's not that big a deal. This is oddly reminiscent of my freshman year when my dorm phone AND my computer AND probably something else essential all broke at the SAME TIME. I remember jumping in my car to go to Target or something to get on fixing things...it was then I realized, looking at my shit-mobile, the one thing I can always trust to be unreliable, it was functioning fine and would help me get things done. I had a similar realization driving to the mall today, and I thank God that He decided to keep my Mazda trucking at least one more week before I lose my front axle. And you know how important THOSE are...</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>I talked to my mom and I'm a little more calm about the laptop thing. I feel so bad, she seems to bear the burden of my needs, my unnecessary wants. I think I need a computer. My dad may disagree. I think I need a car. My dad disagrees, he seems more willing to deny me these things where my mom wants to provide them for me, putting herself through hell to do it. She said she'd wait to move out of her mom's apartment to get me a car, and that made me sad. Why do I have to be such a burden on her? I am trying my best, I guess I could get a job, it just seems that I should focus on school and all and not making ends meet...my dad doesn't see that, and sometimes, he leads me to believe his interpretation of things.</p>
<p>I feel better now, I've really been in stickier situations. Last year, my computer crashed when it got a virus (i.e. journal entry <a href="../fall02/11-10journal.html">"Crashed"</a>). That sucked, I remember going to dinner with Sonya and Missy going on and on about fixing my computer, I felt like I had to fix it that instant, it was agonizing. I was fine in the end. Patience is something I really should learn. As far as getting over comforts like my laptop, I think I'm making powerful strides, especially regarding my car. As far as making it to campus, I've been riding my bike and taking the bus. Today, I took the car cause I knew I had to go to Best Buy. I enjoy riding my bike, I'm going to have a toned ass like nobody's business.</p>
<p>And that's another thing! I looked in the mirror this morning, and maybe it was last night's stressing about my computer, but I look damn good. I've come along way from half-off all the food I can eat at Taco Mac. I have a flat little tummy and I have to wear my belt every day because my sister encouraged me to have two inches of "leeway" and my waist is too small to take it so I've walk around all day with my pants falling down. Whatever, I am a 32 and I have been since high school, and I will STAY a 32! If only I had alittle more color...but I really don't care about that. I've always said (god, since I got lobster legs during <a href="../springbreak/springbreak2002.html">Spring Break 2002</a>) that I'm not going to torture or inflict myself with cancer in order to gain some color. I just don't see the point. Deal with my healthy, toned, pale ass. Yah, you know you want it ;-)</p>
<p>If I could have sex with anyone right now, it would be: Mary Kate...because she'd go to Spa Night with me and be my special friend :-)</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I Boned w/ Stefanie last night. Can you believe that? We had such a good time. About two-thirds of the way through the conversation I had with her about going to Bones I realized that if she didn't want to go, getting to go would be a miserable experience for both of us because we would have expectations of eachother that could never be met. I told her to call me if she had an outstanding desire to go. She called me back five minutes later.</p>
<p>I'm really happy she had a good time. I had a good time too, I enjoy seeing people and talking to them on Wednesday nights. I also got into the dancing alot last night. Can't say I've "bad danced" with Leigh very much, but I did some of that last night. Very hot. What's with my dancing with all the sexy ladies (and Charlie)? I get all freaked out when someone else wants to dance w/ me, mostly because I don't like the whole dance flirting and I REALLY don't want to be leading anyone on. Words work so much better for me than pelvic thrusts. Despite this, I should talk more to people and be less skittish. Last night seemed normal, though I continue to struggle with something very unnecessary. No one to talk about it with, of course.</p>
<p>The music last night was better. I heard "Missing", which prompted me to stay for one extra song which ended up being the entire rest of the night. I said goodbye to Kyle twice, but not three times! He swore that it would be three. Also, heard "Bizarre Love Triangle", which is always a joy, if brief.</p>
<p>Anyways, the point of this entry was to let everyone be aware of my party on Saturday. Yes, my second party...well, not EXACTLY my party, it's sorta my present to Chris Cross (of pervasive fame and name recognition) and the sexy Liz. I'm trying to stock the guest list with only the most impressive VIP's which will hopefully include sexy sorority girls, sexy Lipscomb RA's, sexy best friends, raunchy lesbians, dramatic gay folks, and out of place str8 people. Oh, what fun. I didn't think my last party was THAT good, but everyone else did, hopefully this one will have the same effect. We'll see. I have until Saturday, so maybe Friday I can wait in anxious anticipation! Call me for directions...probably won't be Instant Messanging this weekend...</p>
<p>Yah, laptop is still comatose. Everything will be fine EVENTUALLY, but I'm waiting on pins and needles for GC Computers to through me a frickin' bone, and let me inform you that I am sick and tired of hearing the same old shit, "No dice." You know what you can do with your dice, you can shove them up your ass and play crabs (cause you know you've got them). Computerlessness makes me so pissed off! >:(</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Apologies on the title. I already know someone out there is disecting it, wondering why I would choose something so odd. I'm sorry already, get over it. I waffled between "Patience" or possibly a lyric from "Karma Police" (I have oddly been listening to that song alot this week). "Computerlessness" is mildly witty and alittle more expansive than it's peers. My Computerlessness week was good, but could have been better.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I got my computer back. I was very surprised to recieve a call from GC Computers telling me my SHITTY computer had been FIXED and that it only cost $59. I mean, WOW. How the hell did they find Pro-Star parts to fit THAT?! Turns out I had some busted RAM and the lady didn't know nearly enough English to tell me why my computer wouldn't turn on. WHATEVER, the computer is working better than it has in MONTHS. Imagine...no more crashes! Sure, the hard drive might be going bad, but no more crashes! No more blue screens of death!! Wow, It's just a miracle. The cheapest "miracle" you could think of.</p>
<p>What I admire most about myself was going on without my computer. It seemed on Monday night that things were so grim...what could I do? I thought the end had come and it had me so frazled, I couldn't think of anything else. In reality, however, a computer is an object, and I don't need it. Even though it's useful and it's absence would make things difficult, it doesn't warrant me being a basket case and swearing to God that my life as I knew it was over. I'm glad that this week I was able to function and deal. It certainly isn't the end of the world.</p>
<p>So yah, in anticipation of the end of the world, I backed up all my school work and mp3's last night. I also had movie fun w/ Missy into the wee hours of the morning. We watched <i>The Real Cancun</i> and <i>Chicago</i>. Yah, so lots of pelvic thrusting in <i>The Real Cancun</i>, I think Missy really enjoyed it. We've gotten on this thing now where we'd like to see eachother's unmentionables. This goes a long way toward the "raunchiest semester ever," but I wonder how realistic my interests in her "na-na's" are. I mean, while everyone will be WASTED tonight at my house, I will remain dry and congruent. Yes, my friends, November 10th is on its way.</p>
<p>Two things I've realized. I've said everything I wanted to say and I'm hungry. Please don't forget about my party, it's tonight, and to my surprise, a shitload of people seem to be coming. Maybe I should mix music :-p Please come, and DON'T FORGET TO BYOL!!!</p>
