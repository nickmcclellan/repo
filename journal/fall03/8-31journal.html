<div class="post">
<p>Yah, so my weekend sucked. I worked my butt off at Taco Mac, you have no idea. I made a shitload of money though. My only reservation is the enourmous amount of stress, time, and energy that needed to be involved for such a business arrangement. What a load of crap! My attitude after my Taco Mac weekend from hell was NOT good, especially since Matt was unable to acquire <i>Back to the Future Part II</i>. Sorry babe, I was really looking forward to that...maybe in the FUTURE.</p>
<p>So today I didn't do a damn thing. I watched Buffy w/ Matt and I sat around. Yey for Labor Day. It's like an oxymoron, right? It's an oxymoron I earned, at least. Anyways, I'm off...</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>There's a new Buffy soundtrack coming out. The last one was very cool. I got it when I was still in high school, probably junior year. Jen and Allison really hated Buffy the show, but they loved the album. The show is notorious for playing some really kick ass music. On the next soundtrack, due out September 30th, there are songs like the Dandy Warhols "Bohemian Like You", Devics "Key" (remember that sexy scene w/ Spike and Drusilla feeding on that poor boy at the Bronze??), Aimee Man "Pavlov's Bells", Michelle Branch "Goodbye to You", and other yummy selections from Blur, Joey Ramone, and Bush, among others. I think this might be one album I'd actually buy.</p>
<p>So, yah, what I was writing earlier, last week. I think I started that in an attempt to be creative, to make an interesting point. Not sure it was as thought out as I wished it could have been. Sometimes I wish I could sit back in a nice coffee shop and write stuff here that no one would understand. Well, maybe that's not my exact intention, but that's what would be implied to those who would not understand what it is I'm trying to say. Internet Journals...they bug me. I've read too many that are "blah blah, birthday party, blah blah, big test, blah blah, I'm so happy, blah blah, I'm so depressed I could swallow tar...", and I'm sick of it! I think there are some people that have interesting Blogs...Matt's isn't bad. I think he actually trys to communicate something of particular meaning. Most entries in anyone's random blog would compile hoards of worthless information concerning classes, social interactions, and petty taciturn emotion. I think the aim I'd like to adopt would be to transmit my blog onto a higher frequency--to produce something meaningful and timely so that this venture isn't an entire waste of space on my free Geocities account. Well, that's my real intention, and I hope to make what it is I say as dense and meaningful as possible.</p>
<p>Well, back to my point, I think I was starting on a thought I had at the time (which I didn't get to finish until after my shitty weekend, which is why it's so short and unfulfilling). I was just sorta wondering if you could think about an object so much that it would recreate the object as a duplicate inside your mind that is distinct, communicative, and responsive. Could you think, love, or be bothered by some object so much that you would ignore further original observances of said object because you have already recreated this object to react in accordance with all your previous expectations, presumptions, and desires? Can such a process be reversed? To what extent has this creation prevented truthful explication of the situation? And most importantly, what am I talking about?</p>
<p>Submitted for your approval (to the midnight society...remember that shit??). Well, I'm off to class. This entry will just have to rest in the belly of my twisted Amnisiac.

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, September 4th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>How are things? Well, I hope. Seems I'm still the most popular person I know. Well, maybe not, but I recently checked how many hits I have been getting on my Blog and I noticed that last week netted 70, and that's pretty damn good. The best was some 90 or more I think, so someone's obsessed w/ me. Scary. Hopefully he's sane.</p>
<p>Oh, random nice person of the week recognition goes to Nathan. He totally says hi to me all the time, and it's just strange cause I'm so anti-social sometime, at least walking through campus, but Nathan is so nice, he's all like saying hello from his car in an intersection as I walk to my car. What a good guy. Someone should get him a muffin or maybe something nicer.</p>
<p>I made an appointment at Marietta Eye Clinic (I know...exciting...) Not sure if you have noticed or not, but I'm so not wearing contacts because Matt knocked one out of my eye...well, it wasn't his fault as it was my drunk ass not being cognicent enough to scoop it out of my eye and put it back in properly. This happened a little over a week ago, and I've had to keep w/ glasses until my mom's VSP went through. It will be nice to SEE again, I really appreciate my mother helping me out on this. As you get older, it's things like VISION and HEALTH that your parents just take less and less of an interest in. So yah...I'm cuter in contacts anyways.</p>
<p>Well, that's enough of an update for now. Friday I think I'll do movie night. If Cat goes, I must go because Cat, though not mentioned last week, she's totally random nice person of LAST week. Hanging w/ the Bitches will be crazy go nuts (cool combination of garbage/Strong Bad lingo...)</p>
<p>Peace Out</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Had a spat w/ Missy and Gen that lasted a few hours but all's well. Things are much better between Marilia and I. Yah...it's late though, so going to bed now...</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>So I saw this old bald egghead wearing my Homsar t-shirt today. Word of advice, folks--STAY AWAY FROM HOMSAR! He's mine.</p>
<p>Well, a word on the "fight" last night which really wasn't that big of a deal. Basically, Missy and I asked Scott to get us some alcohol, and I had arranged w/ Scott to take us to the liquor store at 10 on Thursday so we could get it out of the way. Well, for some reason, after calling him several times and IMing him, he didn't seem to answer...and then when I saw him at Blue Sky, he said he thought it was Friday...which I thought was ridiculous because I know I said Thursday. Anyways, for whatever reason Scott decided to back out of helping Missy and I, it happened. I kinda wish I knew earlier because I know other people that are willing to help me out. So I called Mary Kate and unfortunately she didn't have a fake. I called Aiman and he didn't have a problem with helping us out. Anyways, it ended up taking a while, and right before Missy dropped me off, we got in the squabble about her basically saying that I didn't respect her time, and though I apologized for taking up most of the evening, she felt I was insincere. Anyways...this somehow tied into Marila and Gen, so we had this big talk about it...I talked to Gen, Missy, and Marilia during three separate times during the evening. Everything is cool now, and tailgating is on for Saturday ;-) Only cool people need attend...and I mean that.</p>
<p>Today is my and Matt's four month anniversary. I totally want to do something w/ him tonight, not sure what. I don't feel like spending mucho money, so maybe we can movie or do something inexpensive, because that seems appropriate. This would be the first anniversary that we're actually in the same town. I suppose that's somewhat special, yes? fo sho.</p>
<p>I can't wait to tailgate tomorrow! Last night we got a liter of Bacardi Limon, and a half-gallon of Everclear and another half-gallon of Smirnoff Apple Twist. Yah, Missy's favorite! Matt can't make it, but that's alright. He understands that tailgating w/ Missy is very necessary. I am extatic, lost in anticipation. So, yah...totally having fun tomorrow.</p>
<p>Invite me to a party ;-)
