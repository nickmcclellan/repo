<p>Sorry for being absent as of late. As seen with the late arrival of my site update (if anyone noticed), I have been having internet issues. Turns out Charter won't switch on anything of the cable variety until Tuesday of next week. Snakes and nasty kittens, that just makes this place about the most boring dank pit...well, no, that's not true. I do have Buffy DVDs, and we've been watching them lots and lots!</p>
<p>Besides that, I've been busied with many things. Picked up Fray #8 the other day, thought it rocked. I love the absense of Buffy SOMETIMES, it's nice to know there are other things out there to fixate on. Fray may be a while, but it's good. It's worth the wait. This last week I also have seen some Athens folks. Daniel, Kristin, Barry, Gen, Stef, the Lambda board, etc. Two people I have been DYING to see are PADMINI and CHARLIE, who I have no way of contacted because, as far as I know, they are homeless until moving to Steeplechase on Saturday...maybe Saturday. Anyways, if this smoke signal reaches them, maybe they can give me a call or SOMETHING. Lastly, over the last few days I've finished setting up my room. It's very nice, the video game and DVD entertainment area is of particular interest. Many have perished of Mario Kart here already.</p>
<p>I think it was late last night when I realized it was Wednesday and I wasn't at Boneshakers. I think I've been so busy setting up for this damn Lambda picnic that it was just impossible for me to boogie. I would have loved to, but I guess I'll just have to wait until next week. Last night I got a call from Bethani. My sleeply self refused to answer the phone, but I wonder what that was all about...</p>
<p>Anyways, I guess I'll depart touting the Picnic today. If you're not there, well just screw you, screw you naughty! That's just really awful that you would ignore my beautiful work! Besides, we'll have slaugtered beef and pork to be grilled...and you know how nummy that stuff is ;-) For now, I think I'll shower in my nice bathroom (w/ a window! no peeking). Later all.

<p>We had a small gathering last night. I suppose it went well, things will be more fun once everyone gets in town. Missy's moving in today, but I'm told I won't even see her until tomorrow. That really sucks. She would have been fun to hang out w/ last night. Anyways, we had a good time, talked, enjoyed my place. I'm sorta being lazy now, waiting for Matt to get off work. I've got to clean my room and house today. It's kinda messy. I seem to be the only one who cares about that, at least it may seem that way. It seems that Milo and Marilia aren't around very much. They both live very close to Athens, so it's easier for them to go home. Me, however, will NOT be going back to Marietta ANY time soon. The 30th, I'll work, make some money. That's about it.</p>
<p>Tonight, I may go out with, what Matt refers to as the "O-house Gang" to a movie. <i>Uptown Girls</i>. Yah, I'll have to get into that one later. Um, but I think I have to meet with the Board to discuss the first meeting we'll be having Monday. Yesterday, Barry and I cleaned the office. It's looking very nice. Lambda seems to hold onto alot of useless stuff. Got rid of most of it. I think the Office will become like my room on campus. I mean, I have to run that thing, so I think it will just become like my haven, my space. It's going to be great. I'll do all my Lambda shit there and everything. It should be very nice, John will be missed, but I think I will do things very well.</p>
<p>Anyways, other things going on...as always, I suppose. Not sure though, never am. But, besides that, Jeremy has been around. He provided the Vodka last night so I mooched. He's moving in today and so is Dina. You know, <a href="../../friends/dina.html">Dina</a>. Maybe you'll meet her, but for now, she's MY friend and she's going to MY school now, and that's awesome. Probably the only high school friend I'll coordinate w/ here at UGA. I hope she calls me today, I'd like to see her place. For now, I think showering is a good idea. And changing. If I don't get a dryer today, I'm going to be pissed.</p>
<p>One more thing, the title for this week. Done. And that's that. The sky rumbles in agreement. Alright, until next time, I think I need to see Padmini, and people should leave voice mails. Good bye.</p>
<p>...really cool storm outside right now. It's hailing! I love rain like this, it's so excited, I have to go outside and watch...</p>
