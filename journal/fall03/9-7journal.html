<p>My weekend was...short. Sadly, the only real thing that had any social significance was tailgating, and that was at best mildly interesting. I think we should switch that up alittle, so something more elaborate next time. Friday and Saturday night I tooled around w/ Matt. That's rather non-explanatory, in any sense because, yah, I don't want to. Today, I'm doing laundry and studying. Big fun. <i>Buffy</i>'s on the tube.</p>
<p>I got MuffinFilm stickers in the mail today! Give me suggestions of where to stick those. Everywhere! Yah, there are only like 28 of them. I was thinking on my laptop mostly...but permanent branding like that is sorta against my obsessive nature. I swear, I could never get a tattoo...that would just piss me off so much. Having to be branded in a spot for the remainder of your life...that's not so much the issue. I think the idea of spoiling a clean slate bugs me the most. Piercing might be interesting, but only in certain places...well, now that I think about it, I'll probably be abstaining from that as well. Excuse me, Mr. Boredom.</p>
<p>I'm sorry Mary Kate! I wish I could have gone out w/ you last night, but energy was hard to find. I guess I'm just so lazy...still haven't found that drive to do stuff. You know, that drive to do something meaningful with these few months of existance. Where do you think I'll find something like that? Not here.</p>
<p>I've been recently informed that we're having a party on Friday at my house. Expect hyping. I want the biggest bash ever. We're talking John Lynch parties here. Everyone's wasted. (I'm locking my room, no fucking). I think I'll tool w/ my front page for this...yey! Creative fun!</p>
<p>Gee, I'm half tempted to write a Sherry Cherry now, but I better use this time to read. Oh! Yah, the party is for Gen. She's turning 21. Yey for that. Sorry, so involved w/ hyping, I forget the point of such an endeavor. Ok, later persons.</p>
<p>BTW, I don't know how this Peter Pan/Wendy thing arose between April Conway and I, but I just seem to run w/ it. Here's to mindless drunken associations!

<p>Today was a car day. Happily, I only spent nearly $20 on the piece of junk, but I could have spent almost $300. Yah, apparently the bearing on my right front tire is bad and needs to be replaced. Sigh...I just can't stand this crap anymore. Always SOMETHING. I need a new car, I've had enough. The guy at Auto Age, he seemed like a good guy, I think that I will take it to him to fix. I'm not in a big rush to though. I suspect I've had this bad bearing since last Christmas. Seems to be holding up just fine, I think. My father just doesn't understand. This car is like a gaping wound. Any money I could have saved for school, for study abroad, it's all been sucked up by this waste of space. Why is it that my sister is given a reliable car and I get the money pit? She's got four speeding tickets, why does she get all the perks? I think I deserve a new car, a more reliable vehicle...and air conditioning would be nice...</p>
<p>So yah, party this Friday. To those who seem to have plans w/ a talented musician Mr. Rufus Wainwright, I'm sorry that you feel the pinch. Sure, my party is going to rock...sure, you could do a keg stand...sure, you can fuck in any other room but mine, but it's Rufus! Go to Rufus, come to the party afterward ;-) Sure, you get to have your cake and eat it too, but you might not want to kiss it. I suspect around midnight to 2 a.m. vomitting would have already occured, and you know how disgusting that is. Yah, well, I won't explain.</p>
<p>Anyways, I think Bush is an idiot. Wouldn't it be cool if his speech last night took on the ramifications the "Malaise Speech" had on Carter. What's up w/ Bush? Does he just figure arguments questioning the Administration's justification for action in Iraq are trivial bi-partisan bickering? I think he should take such questions more seriously. I really believe that a Democratic opponent has a shot against Bush. It seems like a strong offensive against the Republican Party is in order. To what extent has the party mislead our nation? What exactly are the objectives of the Bush Administration? These questions should be answered, fo sho, MOST DEF!</p>
<p>So yah, time for the Lambda meeting...gay marriage...this should be fun...oh, yes...yawn, sleeping now...zzzzzzzz......</p>
<p>J/K, I'm sure Stef did a fantastic job. SNOOZE!</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>I wish I could say certain things here. I wish I could be "bad" and say everything that was on my mind, and to hell w/ whoever reads this...but I'm only so strong. I'm only good to a point. So I'll say this...</p>
<p>I love Matt.</p>
<p>That's all that matters...goodnight.

<p>I went running w/ Gen tonight! Yey! Feeling all good about the physical exersion. FOUR MILES! I still got it...I am not even conditioned!</p>
<p>We had a run in w/ her car alarm though. Her window was down so I unlocked the door so I could get my keys in her seat. Her ALARM started blaring, and we couldn't get it to turn off! I was scared shitless, and then I had to fumble furiously through the user manual trying to figure out how to disable the alarm. We drove down some random road down Whit Davis so that we wouldn't disturb my neighbors. We finally figured it out though...turns out we had to put Gen's key in the door to stop it.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Gen said it was a classic "Nick and Gen" moment. I guess she's right...it was stressful, frightening fun.
