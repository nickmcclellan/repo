<div class="post">
<p>Home now. Back in Athens. Everyone seems happy that this is so. Catch me sometime this evening.</p>
<p>Oh, and uber toast because I came up with it and April made it funny. I can assure you though, I am not the tracer. She's the tracer.

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, November 4th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Here I am. No need to continue looking, right? Well, it's already been a mixed bag this week. Tonight I got a new cell phone. It's dreamy and I've been tinkering with it for hours. I really should be working on my Spanish presentation, but I feel less than motivated. Oh well...FYI on the cell phone, it's the same number. Maybe now I'll actually answer the dang thing ;-)</p>
<p>My sister called, she was on her way to look at cars. This means that hopefully very soon I will be getting HER CAR, which means <b>NO MORE SHIT MOBILE!!!</b> Wow, I mean, I never thought this day would come, but yah, I really doubt that it's going to happen. Had a miracle scare this summer and that never came to be. We'll see about this false hope.</p>
<p>I guess I could go into Maryland a bit more. It was alot of fun. I got into a spat with Matt that ended up making me feel really bad and I wanted to make it up to him. Since then (and really since he and I had a talk a couple of weeks ago) I have been very affectionate toward him. I don't know why, it's really strange, you would think I was in love (well, I sorta am). He's just beautiful, and I can't help but love him. Anyways, the trip consisted of sight-seeing in D.C., movie watching at John's apartment, visiting various places around John's school (The University of Maryland, Go Terrapins!), and many tickle fights. April, you may have won the battle, but I won the war!</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Matt and I's 6 month anniversary. This is kind of a big deal. I kinda glossed over the last two months, though we did quasi-special things. We're both really poor so we kinda have to opt out of dinner, though I'd love to take him someplace really special. I think I'm just going to give him my Wednesday night--he said something about me saying I wanted to go to Boneshakers, but NO!!! I would never pervert such a special evening with a trip to THAT dive. No, it's our special night of Buffy and togetherness ;-)</p>
<p>Anyways, my computer seems to be acting up again. I just don't know what to do, I'm just not that worried about it anymore. I've gotten it to work again, it's saying some shit about having to repair the Windows installation. I'm going to see if Chuck can help me with that, he's a sexy brain ;-)</p>
<p>ONE MORE THING! My meeting with Trebor Healey went WONDERFULLY! Trebor was really cool and I encourage everyone out there to purchase his book at the book store. He was very down to earth and he had alot to share with the group. He went with us after the meeting to dinner and even ventured to Boneshakers with a group of people to see Raven, some Atlanta drag queen. Everyone responded really well to him. Next semester I hope to find someone half as cool as Trebor to bring to my meetings...</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm going to go home now to read, play with my cell phone some more, and EAT SOME FOOD!

<div class="post">
<p>I love my family. You know, the little ones...this time it's my aunt and sister, but I generally love them all. Things suck, you know? They've sucked for a while. Do you remember last Thanksgiving? I never thought a Buffy marathon could end so badly! Well, things are better, but they still suck. My family and my cousin's family have fallen apart, but we still love eachother. My aunt and my sister came to Athens and stole me away from my 15 minute presentation long enough for me to feel my Ralph Lauren towels and blink--I'M ALIVE.</p>
<p>In regards to the <a href="../spring02/weekofhell.html">Week of Hell</a> which I've never lived down, my mother tells me everything will work out, and I believe that. I have things to get over, I have confidence to build. It's important to remember that you have people that love you and believe in you. My sister is so good to me, and I don't know why, it must be love. I don't know if I'm nearly as sweet to her, but I must be, I have to be, because why would I recieve so much when I deserve so little. Like I said, I love my family.</p>
<p>Oh, yah, in other news, if you think you have a place in my cell phone, please let me know. I'm auditioning space in my beautiful cell phone's SIM card, and if you think you've got the stuff, send me some digits and we'll give it a whirl. My phone kicks Nokia's ASS! No more shit phones...let's cut the crap! Yeah!!!</p>
<p>So, Spanish presentation tomorrow. After that, PAUSE, then Lambda retreat. I wear the cheese. It does not wear me. After that, quality time with my subconsious. Saturday morning, Lambda retreat. No T.V. and no beer make Homer something something... After that, party at April's. Revel in my soberness, marvel at my ability to walk in straight lines. After that, apparently my dad is coming up on Sunday. Wow, I don't know why, I wish he would call and tell me these things. Monday, I'm not sure if you've noticed, but I TURN 21. Fucking scary man. I won't be going out though, maybe, I don't know. I don't want to drink then...I want to wait maybe until the possibility that I might recieve a surprise birthday party on Saturday. We'll SEE!</p>
<p>You're like page 350 of a trashy romance novel. Scarred, beaten, and thirsting for more...
