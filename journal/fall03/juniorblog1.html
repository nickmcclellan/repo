<h2 class="date-header">A most difficult and humble time...</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>At the beginning of my Junior year, everything was different: I was an upperclassmen. Athens was no longer the alien college landscape it once was for me. It was familiar&#8212;almost comfortable&#8212;and I had finally found the niche into which I belonged.  There were, as always, obstacles in the new year.</p>
<p>After the fallout from my poor landing in Trivedi's class, I started to feel that maybe I wasn't up to snuff as an English major. Also, my parent's divorce had taken away any sense of &quot;home&quot; I ever had. Lastly, my budding relationship with Matt brought up so many questions. Could we survive the whole fall semester? Could we really make it to a year? Was I really in love with him?</p>
<p>I faced so many challenges during my Junior Year. I went many places, experienced many highs and lows, and in the end, while it may have been the most dismal and least glamorous of all of my years at UGA, it was by far my favorite. I felt whole. I felt vindicated. And I was loved. For these things, and so many more, I will never regret my very special Junior Year.</p>
<p><strong>All By Myself</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest adjustment of my Junior Year was <a href="8-3journal.html" target="_blank">moving into my townhouse</a>. Since I had had my fill of dormitory life, I decided to get a place with my good friend Marilia and our mutual friend Milo. Moving day was a hugh chore, but it was such a comfort at the end of the day when it was finally over. After assembling my bed in the wee hours of the morning and entertaining Matt, my first guest, I was truly home.</p>
<p>It was different being in a place all by myself. For one, I wasn't even by myself, I lived with two other people. I didn't know Milo very well, and quite honestly, that never changed once the whole year. We got into a fight once, but after that, he stayed in his room and I stayed in mine. Well, I did get out alot more than he did. Marilia was an awesome roommate, if messy. Though we started out being just two people living together, our friendship evolved into something so much more meaningful.</p>
<p>One thing I should note about my roommates is we were all on the Lambda Board of Directors. Having filled John's vacant seat the previous Spring and working during the summer to raise funds for the organization, I was in full swing in my responsibilities as Administrative Director. Staffing the Lambda Office, planning meeting, answering e-mails&#8212;I was Mr. Gay. It was creepy. An early highlight, though, was organizing the <a href="8-10journal.html" target="_blank">Lambda picnic</a> in August. I got to see old friends and meet all the new freshman.  Lifelong friendships started for those newbies that day and I felt good to have helped make that happen. It was one of a handful of things that I felt Lambda got right.</p>
<p>The fall semester also brought along its share of troubles. It was never a secret that my Mazda was a complete piece of shit. That started to become more apparent when I would drive it to school and it would randomly <a href="8-17journal.html" target="_blank">stop</a> in the middle of the road. After I got some <a href="8-24journal.html" target="_blank">sobering words</a> from an honest mechanic (at last!), I told both my parents that I was <a href="9-7journal.html" target="_blank">through</a> with the Shitmobile. I was not spending another dime on that car and I wanted them to help me get out of it. Help didn't come quickly and I was bumming rides and taking the bus in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>Body Shots, Orgies and Green M&amp;M's</strong></p>
<p>If there was one thing that could be said about the fall semester, it would be that it certainly had its share of amazing parties. Missy and I were frequent party-goers, as one tryst could testify to us swapping <a href="8-17journal.html" target="_blank">green M&amp;M's</a> during sloppy kisses. We had this strange wager that we were determined to deliver the raunchiest semester ever! Considering what happened, it was certainly that and more.</p>
<p>Genevieve, myself, and Missy were all turning 21 and we had all promised to give eachother phenomenal celebrations. Gen was up first and she wanted <a href="9-14journal.html" target="_blank">a keg and a funnel</a>, so Missy and I delivered. It was my first party I'd thrown at my place and it was a pretty decent one. Things got alittle loud which prompted the cops to show up, which was a real scare for some party-goers. Jeremy exclaimed, after emerging from hiding in Marilia's closet, "I have scholarships." Yeah, partying at my place certainly became a liability.</p>
<p>Before my 21st birthday party, I decided to host a party for some of the freshmen (<a href="10-19-03journal.html" target="_blank">Chris and Liz</a>). What, by any conservative estimation, should have been a lame party turned out to be something quite different. I don't think I've ever had that many people in my house. Even though I had <a href="9-21journal.html" target="_blank">sworn off</a> alcohol until my 21st birthday, I ended up having a pretty nice time. There were body shots and drama and&#8212;oh, and did I mention the <em>orgy???</em> Yeah, there was one of those too.  And, as per Nick party tradition, the cops showed up, and this time they gave me a nice $125 ticket. Wonderful.</p>
<p>Before my birthday bash, I ventured on my first <a href="10-26-03journal.html" target="_blank">Fall Break</a> trip with Matt, Barry, and April. We went to see John at the University of Maryland. It was a bit of a challenge scrounging up a car, but we were eventually on our way north. The trip was rife with drama (I had an inopportune fight with Matt), but there was also much fun to be had. During a riveting game of the grocery store word game, I coined the term &quot;uber toast.&quot; Hey, it could happen! I mean, there isn't a day that goes by that I don't have a craving for some fantastic uber toast.</p>
<p><strong>Popular</strong></p>
<p>I was so obnoxiously social that fall semester. I felt so connected and essential, it was like I had found my place. Unfortunately, being the center of attention had its consequences. Though I had learned my lesson about using my Blog as a way of talking about people, I did produce a rather politically charged <a href="9-21journal.html" target="_blank">Sherry Cherry</a> cartoon that whipped up some drama. Interesting how I really nailed down the social commentary.</p>
<p>Besides cartoon related drama, Missy and Gen threw me a <a href="11-16-03journal.html" target="_blank">quasi-surprise birthday party</a>. Though I didn't quite muster the number I had for Chris and Liz's party, I felt on top of the world among those who did show up. Being popular (in my own singular sense) did have its perks, but shortly after that, I started to feel the burn (in more ways than just the killer hangover I had after blacking out and getting really sick). </p>
<p>The semester, academically, had its highs and its lows. I got a much deserved <a href="12-14-03journal.html" target="_blank">A</a> in my Spanish class. I worked my tail off, and even delivered a challenging <a href="11-2-03journal.html" target="_blank">15 minute presentaci&oacute;n</a> on the Mayan civilization. It was tough. On a sadder note, I still hadn't overcome the difficulty of upper level English classes. I got a C in my American Modernism class, and that really had me bummed and I never wanted to talk about <a href="12-14-03journal.html" target="_blank">those finals</a> every again. I felt like I was just stupid, and I knew that wasn't right. I wanted to prove everybody wrong. I wanted a second chance.</p>
<p>During <a href="12-07-03journal.html" target="_blank">Missy's birthday</a>, instead of painting the town red with my favorite faux-sorostitute, a very different dilemma came up. I made a choice that night&#8212;one I had been secretly choosing all semester long. Matt was sad, and though I probably could have left him alone on that dirty street to deal with his problems while I continued to party with all my friends, I grabbed his hand. I left Missy behind and took my Mattie home. I was so in love with him, and he was so important to me that I couldn't leave him behind. I was <a href="11-30-03journal.html" target="_blank">so amazed that</a>, through everything that usually accompanied the fall semester, I was still standing by my man.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;New Year's Project&quot;</strong></p>
<p>After <a href="12-14-03journal.html" target="_blank">working away</a> yet another Christmas break (this time in the bowls of Rich's), I came back with <a href="../spring04/1-04-04journal.html" target="_blank">a mission</a>. I wanted to prove I was smart and I could handle the rigorous course load. I had also cut all ties to my father, vowing never to take any money from him after that semester. I had been abused and manipulated for years and I was finally in position to take control. Though I set out for myself several ambitious goals, things didn't start out easy for me.</p>
<p>For one, I had to deal with the repercussions of Chris and Liz's party. In November, I was &quot;<a href="11-16-03journal.html" target="_blank">arraigned</a>,&quot; I guess you could say, and I had my trial on January 26th. It was a unique day. I had a little flu and school happened to be cancelled on account of snow. I had an elaborate defense that consisted of Marilia and Jerm. As the trial began, the judge called me to the stand, told me the officer who gave me the ticket had failed to appear, and said I was free to go. It was the first of many good things that happened that semester. Except, from this point on, good things were treated with &quot;<a href="../spring04/1-25-04journal.html" target="_blank">Brandy faces</a>.&quot; The Blog had never looked so good as it did this spring semester. It was riddled with icons and fabulous content.</p>
<p>In celebration of winning the noise ordinance trial, Missy and I threw a <a href="../spring04/2-01-04journal.html" target="_blank">party at Sonya's</a> apartment (mostly because I was sick of getting charged with crimes at my place). Much <a href="../spring04/2-08-04journal.html" target="_blank">fun was had</a>, but as tradition dictates, the cops did come. Some kid couldn't handle his alcohol (probably because his jerk of a friend was too much of a dick to watch out for him) and someone called an ambulance. That effectively killed that party (and any other future party aspirations I had).</p>
<p><strong>Struggle and Sacrifice</strong></p>
<p>The semester wasn't as glamorous like the year before. Instead of heading out to random parties with Missy on a Friday night, a typical evening would start with maybe me sneaking up to the bus stop to surprise Matt. We'd then go to my house, pop in some Britcoms or Buffy DVD's, and order some pizza. Sometimes our neighbors would fight outside and the cops would have to come break it up. Sometimes Marilia would scare us with her culinary creations or her eclectic wardrobe. It didn't matter, I was with Matt, and I didn't want to be anywhere else.</p>
<p>Things with the Mazda didn't get better. While I was able to use it when it was necessary in the fall, I felt things were too dire in the Spring, so I had my dad haul it away. My sister brought up my bike from home and I started to use that as my primary Athens transportation. Can you believe I rode that thing 6 miles to class? There was one day that I <a href="../spring04/1-19-04journal.html" target="_blank">missed the bus</a> with 30 minutes before class. I rode my butt off that day, but I made it! I was a sweaty panting mess sitting in the back of the room, but I made it. Before truly letting the Shitmobile go to the intolerable hell below, I let out the glorious <a href="../spring04/2-22-04journal.html" target="_blank">Ode to the Shitmobile</a>, etched forever in Blog history.</p>
<p>Also, things had not been going well with my computer. As a result of the shoddy Pro-Star brand, my laptop suffered several setbacks during my junior year. It <a href="../spring04/3-28-04journal.html" target="_blank">crashed</a> twice, and after replacing two damaged <a href="../spring04/1-11-04journal.html" target="_blank">RAM chips</a> and a <a href="11-16-03journal.html" target="_blank">crumbling hard drive</a>, I realized I would soon have to replace it. But where was I going to find money to do that...</p>
<p>As per Nick and Missy tradition, <a href="../springbreak/springbreak2004.html" target="_blank">Spring Break 2004</a> was planned to be the most extravagant and luminous excursion of all. We went to Disney World, Key West, and Miami Beach. We had planned on taking a good group of people, but after the subhuman jerk Alex weaseled out of his commitment at the last minute, it was an awkward threesome of me, Missy, and Matt. It wasn't too bad, but I think we all learned alot from eachother that trip. It was the last trip for me and Missy. I was faced with the true nature of our friendship that week.  While I was still close to Matt, my relationship with my best friend Missy had changed forever.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful Year</strong></p>
<p>By the end of the year, alot of things were coming to a close. I had decided to <a href="../spring04/4-04-04journal.html" target="_blank">pass the Lambda torch</a> to Matt and let down my gay credentials. I wanted to reinvest myself into my potential career and learn to adjust early to the lack of gay student unions out in the real world. For our collective efforts, the organization won a leadership <a href="../spring04/4-25-04journal.html" target="_blank">SOAR award</a>, which I was so peeved about. I guess all those boring board meetings and thankless office hours were worth something in the end.</p>
<p>Marilia was perhaps my best friend that semester. Her and I were certainly an unlikely pair, especially considering how often we bucked heads on roommate issues. I really let alot of abuse out on Marilia and she graciously endured it. She asked me the question one day of why I had always considered Missy, Genevieve, and Matt to be my best friends when it was she who was always there when I really needed her to be when my other friends weren't. I had to admit, she was right. She was one of my best friends, and at that point, I started treating her as such. Oh, and that <a href="../spring04/3-21-04journal.html" target="_blank">party</a> I went to with her, Kyle, and Paul wasn't bad either.</p>
<p>Also, my efforts to achieve academic success really delivered in the end. I scored my first A in an <a href="../spring04/5-10-04journal.html" target="_blank">upper level English class</a>, due in part to a spectacular finish on an all-nighter paper. I also scored big on a paper in my Shakespeare class I was taking at the time.  I got a <a href="../spring04/5-02-04journal.html" target="_blank">C</a> in the class, and I couldn't be happier. You see, I learned that I had certain strengths and weaknesses, and it was ok to falter at times. I had proven that though I wasn't perfect, I was also not stupid.</p>
<p>The end of the semester also brought something pretty damn special: <a href="../spring04/5-02-04journal.html" target="_blank">One Year with Matt</a>. It was really significant to experience that. Everyday it got worse and worse: I just couldn't help but be so seriously in love. We exchanged presents, ordered take out for eachother, and did other various things boyfriends do. I made him a neato Blog retrospective (as you can see I'm so skilled at doing) and even updated his Friends page. I had a whole summer to spend with my Mattie and I was so eager to see what the future held for the two of us.</p>
<p>The near future turned out to be very nice. At the end of my Junior year, I ran into a steady stream of good luck. My mother had been promising me a car all year and her efforts to deliver it finally came. I flew to Dayton and drove back in her '98 <a href="../spring04/5-16-04journal.html">Grand Prix</a>. Except, now it was mine. My aunt also won a <a href="../spring04/5-02-04journal.html" target="_blank">$1 million</a> slots tournament in Vegas and was kind enough to give me a nice sum of $2,500, which pretty much solved any financial problems of the moment. For one, I used the financial stability to fund many pizza nights with Matt and also a nifty new <a href="../spring04/5-16-04journal.html" target="_blank">Dell laptop</a>. Life was good. Real good.</p>
<p><strong>A Golden Summer</strong></p>
<p>Before embarking on my final chapter at UGA, I had one eventful, laid-back summer. I got a job at <a href="../spring04/5-30-04journal.html" target="_blank">Dial America</a> which wasn't much to brag about. It was really boring and proposed many ethical problems for me. I did enjoy working there during that summer though. I worked in the late afternoon until midnight with some really nice people doing really easy work for decent pay. It was nice getting off and coming home to adult swim and <em>Inuyasha</em>&#8212;which suddenly became my favorite programming and Blog icon choice.</p>
<p>With the money I made, Matt and I went on some interesting adventures. We went to see <a href="../spring04/6-06-04journal.html" target="_blank">John in D.C.</a> and went to the <a href="../spring04/6-13-04journal.html" target="_blank">Madonna concert</a> on her <em>Re-Invention</em> tour. That was phenomenal. Who knew that Mr. Shirley Manson would fall for the Material Girl? I felt like I had betrayed my anti-pop way of life, but who can deny the impact of the Madonna? I certainly couldn't any longer.</p>
<p>We also spent one fun day with Diane, my sister, my cousin and her boyfriend at <a href="../spring04/6-06-04journal.html" target="_blank">Stone Mountain</a>. I got to walk up the mountain with Diane, hearing about her recent adventures in Costa Rica (and the love she found in its lush, tropical rainforests). We went to Bundos to bother a server, watched the always mediocre laser show, and I screamed in horror at the sight of metal testicles on a pimped out pick-up truck. Maybe I scared Diane, but it was one good day.</p>
<p>One particular memory I have from that summer was going over to Genevieve's late one night to partake in some Stevi B's pizza and watch <em><a href="../spring04/7-11-04journal.html" target="_blank">Almost Famous</a></em>. Matt came over to share in the evening and the two of us just laid their together on Gen's couch. When I was lying there on Gen's couch, holding him in my arms while watching Kate Hudson bumble through life as a roadie, I felt that singular special sensation of love I had come to treasure. When I think about that summer, I think about moments like that and how I would give anything to be there again. It wasn't glamorous. Maybe we didn't got to the best parties and maybe we had to go through hell to get where we were, but we were there, together. He was my Mattie and I thought he always would be.</p>
<p>I could never let him go. Not without a fight.</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>My Junior year was special for so many reasons. I learned alot about myself and my strengths. I endured alot of hardship, but somehow found a way to persevere. During the year, I lost every one of my most treasured and seemingly necessary possessions: my car, my laptop, and my cell phone. I proved to myself that I didn't need them. I found that the most important things in my life&#8212;my family and friends&#8212;were what really mattered in the long run. As long as I had them when the going got rough, I could conquer any obstacle. No matter how difficult.</p>
<p>At the eve of my Senior year, I felt complete. I knew I was capable and ready to graduate. I wanted to do everything I could to prepare for my eventual departure from Athens. I thought I could take on anything. I thought I could see everything coming.</p>
<p>I had no idea everything I loved was about to fall to pieces.
