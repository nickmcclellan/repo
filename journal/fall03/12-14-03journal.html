<div class="post">
<p>I don't want to study for English, I have it stuck in my head that I can do anything, even McAlexander's nastiest final. I'm thinking, now that it's crunch time, there is going to be more than one essay. I think I'll start studying sometime soon, I wanted to do something creative before I started. I guess it's a good start, starting something I'm pretty sure I can't screw up. We'll see about that.</p>
<p>My weekend accomplishments are very non-existant. I'm starting some organizing of my website on my computer in anticipation for the Spring update. I have been anxiously thinking what I'd like it to look like, I really liked the stripped look this semester, I kinda don't want it to change, but it must. I also, with help from Joseph, found a DVD decoder. I have been without this for a while, since my computer crashed last year. I really want it since I will be going home Tuesday and will have to have something to watch my Buffy Season 5 DVD's on. Oh, I can't wait...</p>
<p>But, I have some finals to get through before that. I just want to go on record for saying I don't like finals. I'm gonna take a stand and say they're not good.

<p>Let's not talk about finals...ever.</p>
<p>Oh, yah, so I was bored after dinner and I started to work on my Spring update, and though I still wish I had a theme that meshed, I came up with a real neat new thing for the Spring. I found some help site on the net and put this script code into the html that enabled me to do rollover icons, SO NOW when your icon rolls over something like my beautiful journal icon, you see an inverted image of the icon, and it looks all neato and cool. It's interesting to me because I've never done Java before (I think that's what I've done) and I remember asking Michiru last year about doing something like this and she told me that it would involve Java and I knew I wasn't ready for it, but I've take the first step, so THAT'S neat.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm leaving Athens tomorrow at around 5:30 to go back to Marietta with Gen and Missy (um, yah, how cool is that?) Missy and I are going to enjoy champagne at her place in celebration of the end of the semester, and I'm very into getting a buzz of something that has less than the amount of alcohol that would kill a small animal. Fun!</p>
<p>Ok, so I'm supposed to be studying Communication Law (who cares) so I think I'll at least start...say your goodbyes while you still can!

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, December 16th...3:54 a.m.</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Is something supposed to happen on the 17th or did something special happen on the 17th in the past? For some reason, I keep thinking it's the 17th, I have no idea why.</p>
<p>Well, the point, I found this writing in my notebook and I thought it would be interesting to put here, and feel free to comment, I think I'll put it in my other "place" too. Here's to poems I don't know I wrote!</p>
<p><u>All I've Ever Wanted</u></p>
<p>A strong man<br>
to hurt me<br>
<br>
A bear, speaking<br>
telling of riddles<br>
but broken<br>
but restored again<br>
<br>
Sweetness, tabled<br>
In cups and dishes<br>
protruding spoons<br>
but tabled<br>
and purged<br>
<br>
And money</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>Spanish (the class that consistantly had me working my ass off): I recieved an A. I just want to say, this feels good. After all the shit, it's nice to get a grade I deserve. I haven't gotten an A in Spanish for a while (Freshman year, but I don't consider that HARD-WORKING Spanish). I consider the last A I got in Spanish to be back in Spanish II when I really learned what the language was. I want to thank Sarmiento for being such an excellent teacher and really teaching the language and encouraging conversation. I'm sure everyone can remember my bitching about the class (FIFTEEN MINUTE LONG PRESENTATION, los artículos, the essays I stayed up all night writing, etc.) No more...all done.</p>
<p>In other good news, I got a shitload of money for my textbooks this year. I'll need it to pay for the present I got for my sister. Also, at this moment I really hate Jagged Edge. Let's stop with this shit R&B/Rap shit. It's shit. It's shitty shit, and the video is a penis.

<p>I don't feel good about myself. I'm envious of those of you who do, so you better enjoy it. It's nice, I bet. I haven't done anything good in a while. There's nothing to be proud of, the only thing I can drag myself to do is the update to my webpage, and let me tell you, it's great! It's wonderful, it's beautiful, it's creative, it's unlike anything I've done before, but you know what, I still don't feel good. I don't like being here, in this place. I'm like Marilia, I want another chance to do it better. I've had three, I know that one more will do it for me, and maybe this time I won't fuck it up.</p>
<p>Obviously, I'd rather not talk about it. I'd rather have a burrito. So much more yummy than potatoes. So many potatoes. Anyways, I'm working at Rich's and the customers are bitches, it's fucking annoying, I want to yell at every one of them, you're already getting a sale, what the hell is another FIVE PERCENT, get over it, your kid's gonna hate that sweater anyways. And I don't like walking across half the store getting a jacket for this lady that picked hers up without a tag. I hope she got a fist full of spite when I took my time getting the damn thing. Sean John? What the hell? Do you really think Puff Daddy puts his keen intellect into every piece of that clothing line? No fucking way.</p>
<p>And I don't get my father these days. I just don't get anything at all, it's just three weeks of misery, I keep telling myself that, that's my only purpose is to make the next few months better, and I will! I'm going to the Keyes and it's going to be awesome, I think I'll drink and go to a few bars with Missy. Maybe I'll write a book too, and a research paper, and I'll start in four weeks.</p>
<p>In the mean time, IM me if you want to see my update, and you don't have to see it if you don't want to. You know, you'll see it eventually I'm sure. Anyways, I'm going now...probably down the hall and out of my mind.
