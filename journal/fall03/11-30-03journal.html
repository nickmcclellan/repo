<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, November 30th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Where did this semester go? I know everyone asks that, so I won't bore you with an explanation of my reasons. I just think of some things I was never able to really do this semester that I had expected I would be doing tons of. Number one would be working...I figured Taco Mac would keep me busy at least once a month. That only happened once. Number two would be drinking--I haven't been drinking as heavily as I did last fall, that's a good thing. It's really not that cool...and as people can remember from my last trip down the bottle, I didn't do so well :-[ I thought I'd tailgate more than I did this semester. The reason I think that tanked was because CERTAIN individuals tried to make it a group/Lambda thing, when it had always been a special tradition between me and Missy. I guess I never organized my notebooks for this semester...I never did too much around the house, though comparitively, must more than my other roommates. I didn't spend nearly as much time at Blue Sky this semester, virtually no time there at all. That's sad, I still really like that place, especially now that the downstairs isn't smoking ;-)</p>
<p>This semester held alot of things I didn't expect I'd do. I'm still dating Matt, and I honestly never saw it lasting this long, and I like taking it on without any expectations. I like being surprised by that, realizing that a relationship with someone doesn't need to conform to some time expectation. I guess I'm saying I see the value of where I've been and not what I expect there to be. There are no expectations. There's still a place for him. I didn't think I'd spend as much time at home. I really love my room, I love everything about this house (except the floor problem in the kitchen, uck). Alot of my most valuable things gave me shit this semester. My computer continues to be a pain in my ass. My car is D.O.A., but like any shit-mobile, frequently rises from the grave. My cell phone went to heaven (or hell?) and I got a new one :-D I learned alot of spanish and did alot of homework, that's something, I guess. I rode a shitload on my bike and on the bus, I've grown over alot of my "addictions" (though my computer seems to be my Achilies' Heal). All and all, I made alot of progress and went into alot of new directions.</p>
<p>I came into my own social-wise. Never have I ever felt like I knew more people, it's insane. At parties, it's like I can't walk w/o running into someone that wants to talk to me. I know, this sounds really self-centered of me, and it's not like I'm popular everywhere I go, but I think that this semester, I just ran w/ my own sect of friends (Missy and Gen) and the three of us just got really popular. I must admit, alot of my social success is due to Missy. That girl is nuts. It's been great going out w/ her this semester, going to parties, and hearing about some amazing bedroom adventures :-p Maybe I'll share a few next weekend w/ her parents ;-)</p>
<p>So yah, that's this week. I have two big projects due in the next 10 days, and of course final prep. Missy's birthday is SATURDAY, so buy her some nice vodka and come to our "gathering." We'll be tearing up the downtown, I'm going to give my ID some usage, fo sho! Gamma Sig semi-formal is Friday, I need to get tidy for that. That's going to be random fun! Anyways, I should go and sleep or something. I think I'll wake up early tomorrow morning to work on Cat's present :-p Night night

<h2 class="date-header">Monday, December 1st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Wow, it's here. Look at that. Ok, onto more important things.</p>
<p>I miss <a href="../../friends/april.html">April</a>...she's so cool, I was looking through my yearbook last night and I realized she was in Math Club w/ Jim...what's up w/ that? Jim was such a nerd, I can't believe her crush on that guy drove her to insane lengths like odd concepts like a math competition. It's a sport I tell you! I think April is my best friend...well, more accuratly, she was my best friend. Everything about that girl just makes me smile. She's smart and she cares about her friends. She's in love with Matt, I'm sure she's got some really cool 30 month anniversary present lined up for him. For my birthday, she got me a Strokes CD, or she said she'd get it for me. I'm not sure what I'll get her for Christmas. Last year I got her <i>Animal Crossing</i> and she loved it! I bet she'd enjoy Mario Kart...</p>
<p>Why am I talking about April? I don't know, I guess I could only think of nice things to say about her or something like that. I like that no one here knows her. Padmini and Laura may have met her, but that's about it. She left that concert early because the smoke was getting to her. I got to hold onto her jacket, that was nice. I tied it around the seat in my car. April was the first person I came out to, when coming out actually meant something to me. She was the first person since grade school that I could look in the face and actually see a real friend. That's funny too because April and I were not always friends. We fought all the time over some really stupid shit. Mostly guys and genetic diseases...but yah, we're still friends. She's never pardoned my arrogance, but she's always had faith that my caring for her would outweigh any pety grudge against her (i.e. not visiting me at UGA my first year). She was right.</p>
<p>Anyways, I wish my car would function so I could drive myself down to her house and sit on the floor and watch her play some Might and Magic. I wish I could tell her about all my fun weekends and hear her gloss it over with some shit about anime. I wish I could watch her talk about Matt, I wish I could watch her drive. I would love to see her complain about her mother. Maybe she'll make me ramen...</p>
<p>Well, the point of this is it's better to say something nice than the other thing. I was going to incorporate a Buffy quote, and as odd as that would be, I think I'll still try. Well, I need to shower and ride off to school. Oh, yeah, and maybe you should read the Blog intro again, I thought I covered that already? Oh well, until next time, BUZZ OFF.</p>

<p>So many cool things have already happened today! One, on a dark note, I was riding to school, about to take a left onto Carlton when I suddenly felt like I was going to vomit. Everything got really bright and I suddenly came over dizzy. It was very scary, but I walked some, and felt better. I'm clueless as to what the episode meant, hopefully nothing...</p>
<p>Jeremy helped me fix the Buffy quote I put into my blog this morning. I wanted it to look like it does now, but I'm not so into table codes, so Jerm gave me a mini lesson. Needless to say, it looks alot better now. Maybe I'll get my presentation grade back in a few mintues when I go to Spanish. Wish me luck!

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, December 3rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Something I forgot to mention on my whole retrospective of Fall 2003--I don't sleep in. Conversely, I sleep alot. I have gotten over that whole bum college attitude of having late classes and sleeping in. I guess that's more involuntary than something I decided to change, but it's worth something. I work on things alot more than I usually used to. I take projects and papers more seriously, but then again I do them in the wee hours of the night and morning (BUT THEY'RE GOOD!) I also sleep ALOT. I more likely now to take a 3 or 4 hour nap before starting to do any work. For some reason, I never got over that Spring facination with napping my problems away. It's great, I find that there's nothing more relaxing and fulfilling for me than to come home after a long and stressful Tuesday and just nap until midnight. Afterwards, I can snack and tool around, working on various projects, such as Editing project I did last night :-D</p>
<p>Missy was a distraction last night, fo sho. She sent me the Paris Hilton sex tape, and that was just, UGH, very interesting...I guess I let out a chuckle when the girl paused between extreme fucking to answer her cell phone. That's considerate, I don't know many friends of mine that would do that for me.</p>
<p>Trebor Healey IMed me last night and thanked me for putting together his reading this semester. He said it was one of the highlights of his whole tour. That was really special for me. I was really stressed about the thing come show time. Not as many people showed up as I would have liked, and there was big show on BUY THIS BOOK, but in reality, alot of our membership did not appreciate being sold a book that's $20. I have kept the posters up in the office hoping that someone will take an interest, I want Trebor to be successful. It's encouraging that the book I bought for the office has gone missing--at least someone is enjoying it. This whole ordeal is what basically put alot of stress on me, worrying if Trebor would be disappointed, but where the book sales may have tripped, the enthusiasm of the night took flight. We had a very nice evening. The best group got together to take him out to dinner, and it was just a very charming conversation. I bet he really enjoyed getting down to earth with a bunch of gay college kids. The evening at Boneshakers was nice as well, for sure. I'm glad this was such a success. It's too bad nobody cares--but that's ok, I at least am pleased.</p>

<p>I got a 92 on my Spanish presentation. Go me.

<p align="center"><img src="http://images.quizilla.com/U/Urchin/1036794232_sinuyasha1.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>Your Inuyasha! You are a punk, you like to pick<br>fights and hate being in school, your grades<br>are slipping but you don't care, you are having<br>to much fun to actually do anything about it!<br><br><a href="http://quizilla.com/users/Urchin/quizzes/What%20Inuyasha%20Character%20are%20you%3F/"> <font size="-1">What Inuyasha Character are you?</font></a><BR> <font size="-3">brought to you by <a href="http://quizilla.com">Quizilla</a></font></p>
<p>I like that the picture is human Inuyasha...I would like to thank April for peeking my interests in this show just like she did for DBZ...now I have another strange anime facination.</p>
<p>Brought Matt some study food at the SLC. He was obviously very pleased, much thanks to Gen for helping me out w/ that. I was really concerned though, he was studying, and obviously distressed (you know, because Matt is incompetent unable to deal with difficult situations) and I didn't see any of his really close friends around, you know, the ones that care very deeply for him. I'm beginning to question whether or not they appreciate him for everything he does. You should have seen all the other people in the SLC just falling all over eachother to be his friend, trying their best to coddle him, because you KNOW Matt of all people needs that. Those non-appreciating friends just don't know what they have. When will they learn?</p>
<p>Don't you LOVE it when people mind their own business and don't assume they know everything about a situation (especially when in reality they know absolutely nothing)? It's a good thing that know that idiotic assumptions make an ASS out of U and ME...well, mostly them, I'd argue.</p>
<p>Anyways, that bed is looking more and more appealing, now that I think about it...</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>Ah, morning...</p>
<p>Well, I guess I should reinforce two things...Blog into, if you're not my friend, BUZZ OFF. Oh, and I wanted to say this. I take comfort in the fact that anything I wrote past my charming quiz depicting the handsome human Inuyasha was completely sarcastic, which is unfortunately not what can be said for others (well, I guess the mind your own business part wasn't sarcastic, but you know...you figure these things would be common sense, right?).</p>
<p>Ha, I guess it's true what they say. What goes around comes around.

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, December 6th</b>...HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY MISSY VALENTINE!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Yes, I will end this week's HORRIBLE journal on a light note. Missy's turning 21 today! Gen and I have some interesting things planned for this evening...have to go start on that w/ Gen right now actually</p>
<p>Last night was Gamma Sig's semi-formal, and it was alot of fun. Wow, buzzing on Everclear and Bacardi is not as bad as I remember it, you know, when I try not to overdo it. I had a great time with the girls, but then I got really tired and they wanted to go downtown, and I knew I'd be doing that tonight with Missy, so I didn't want to wear myself out. I went home, blah, and it was really annoying...all semester I've been waking up early, it's fucked with my sleeping in, I was tossing and turning at EIGHT AM!!! What is up with that? I wanted to wake up at 10, but NO, stupid school...</p>
<p>I guess this week will be titled "Supernatural", but I don't know why. I was going to title it "Maybe", but I think the lyric goes "Supernatural, maybe..." so I guess that would be incorrect. I may change it if I think of something better, you know, like "petty Blog fight" or something more descriptive.</p>
