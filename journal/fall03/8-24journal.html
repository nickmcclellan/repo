<p>Well, I guess I'm not as original as I had originally thought (isn't that a funny saying). I was romping off to Spanish and another fine gentleman was romping off in the opposite direction, approaching me from the front. He was wearing a charming t-shirt from this little website, you may have heard of it, HOMESTARRUNNER.COM. Anyways, he was wearing this site's most popular t-shirt (I know, I'M suprised). Turns out I was wearing the same one. Well, we share good taste, he pointed at me and said hello, and I said hello as well. It was cute. Annoying, but cute.</p>
<p>In other news, I've e-mailed Nicole. You know, the expatriate. She responded in a very timely manner to my e-mail from yesterday. I'm happy to know she still checks her Notre Dame address. I sent her a charming e-mail, she'll smile. I'm good at making her smile, but then, I'm good at making alot of women smile ;-)</p>
<p>An aside...I just want to say, for the record, I find when people put on their profile their class schedule, it is the most despicable thing you could put on an away message. I perceive this to be very vain. Why would I, the away message reader, find any interest in the frequency or length of your classes? If your intention is to give the away message reader an idea of the next opportunity to reach you, I'm sure the reader will realize you have returned when your away message has DISAPPEARED. As far as the target of this aside, I assure you, there is none. I've observed this idiotic practice since last year, and I just wanted to say SOMETHING. I mean, exercise wit! Put up something clever. Do SOMETHING.

<p>So, yah, shit-mobile was giving me the "run-around" on Tuesday. Actually--scratch that--it actually did very little "running"...alot of "STOPPING" though, and of course during times which one would expect a car to function. You can imagine, I was very upset. I recall specifically being stopped on the right side of College Station, merging from Research Rd., nippling on my banana as my right hand shook while putting the car into park and attempting to turn on the ignition--it was unnerving.</p>
<p>Well, that would explain why I'm without a car, for at least a little bit. I need to have it fixed by Friday for my working this weekend. I hope that works out. Sounds like the guy knows what he's doing. Car repairs giv me da jibblies!

<p>You'd never guess. No, really, you're going to have to sit down to hear this one. I know it's hard to believe, but you have to hear it. Are you ready? This is going to blow your mind.</p>
<p>I need a new car.</p>
<p>Anyways, do you think you could love someone so much that it triggers genesis? Of an archetypical type. Of a sort that requires no explanation. A creation modeled so perfectly after experience and tradition, it needs no effort in thought or synthsis. No glimmer of imagination. He just sits in your head, as he always has, smiling at you...in ways you've always expected. Do you think that should happen? Would you find that disturbing, or indecent? Would you find that at all?</p>
<p>Yah, so, maybe.

<p>So, busy weekend. Named this week "Flicker" because I couldn't think of anything really good. Live w/ it. Maybe I'll write better this week...or next week, depending on what day you actually THINK I'm writing this...
