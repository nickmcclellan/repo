<p>Do you find yourself sometimes on a search for that face in the crowd? Have you ever wondered why you were looking?</p>
<hr align="center"><br>
<p>I had a productive day...sorta. I rode my bike to campus from Highland. This sorta proves to me that riding sin Shit-mobile is doable. The only problem is that Mondays I'm usually around kinda late because of the Lambda meeting so I would either have to have someone take my bike home, leave my bike on campus, or ride home in the dark. The dark-rider scenario sounds appealing, but I may just opt to Shit-mobile my way through the day tomorrow. Oh, fun! Life-threatening goodness!</p>
<p>In other news, I may be mysteriously unemployeed. I know, bummer, not like I couldn't get another job here (which I really need to do), it's just annoying! More info on this as soon as I get off my lazy ass and call Taco Mac.</p>

<p>In American Modernism this morning, we talked about how Robert Frost's poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" was about how Santa Claus fills out his reindeer before heading out on Christmas Eve. Frost and beastiality...I always wondered how those reindeer could fly.</p>
<p>In a related story, my ass hurts from riding my bike yesterday. I rode it to school this morning and it was so uncomfortable, my ass throbbing w/ pain from that horribly tough bike seat. Oh couch...how I love couch...

<p>I'm so psyched about this week's journal! I'm hoping I can be all profound and meaningful, communicating something that advances rather than promotes the same old worthless crap I seem to proliferate. Proliferate.</p>
<p>I just seem so full of buzz words this week. I remember at some point yesterday wanting to use this word, but I didn't. I tend to use words incorrectly, and this was an example of a similar instance.</p>
<p>Incorrect. What's a better word for that? Incongruent. Had been feeling a sense of that last night. I like incongruent in the same way I like proliferate, it's just complicated. I don't like the word complicated, it's been used.</p>
<p>Anyways, I read "In a Station of the Metro" in American Modernism, and using it as a guiding light this week seems appropriate because on Friday I have my American Modernism midterm. Anyways, my short remark early Sunday morning may have been subconsiously inspired but Pound's poem, but I highly doubt it. My remark is not nearly as complex as the poem, but what do you think?</p>
<p>The poem is like a recognition. Perhaps a longing for acceptance? Longing, of course, but for something else maybe. You can stare at it until it makes you dizzy, but maybe you'd never understand. Maybe I just need more time.</p>
<p>Stuff to do. Bye.

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, October 10th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>One more month and I'll be 21. One more month and I'm going to be totally plastered, I might die. Wouldn't that be nice? Not everyone gets a chance to die young...but then I wouldn't be young anymore. Doesn't that spank the monkey's ass?</p>
<p>I'm in post-midterm hum, I finished McAlexander's test about 40 minutes ago. I must have looked like a mess after biking to campus. I got about 3 hours of sleep last night because I was up all night cramming for the test. It wasn't completely fruitless--I watched Adult Swim twice. Got to see the Family Guy I had missed earlier in the evening. The opening scene was perfect, with Stewie destroying Mr. Roger's nieghborhood. Oh, my, how I love Stewie.</p>
<p>My program Tuesday went really well, I was a very entertaining host, if I do say so myself. My responsibilities for this week are less now. I have to help decorate tomorrow and I will probably go to Sam's Club sometime this evening. I need Boca Burgers, bread, MILK, candy for the dance.

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, October 11th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Dance tonight. Woo-hoo.</p>
<p>Anyways, I had psycho, unsettling dreams last night. I resent how a certain combination of circumstances can haunt the fucking hell out of me. Oh, woe is me.</p>
<p>Tonight, hoping random fun party occurs. Maybe at my house? I'd push the furniture back. Missy's in Tennessee this weekend for the game. It's possible she'll be...yah, you know. Tomorrow, I've got to research la civilizacion de los Mayos por me presentacion a 7 de noviembre. Yah, and I also have to work on some discussion questions for my Lambda meeting Monday. It should be very interesting.</p>
<p>As for now, looking at the poem again, I wonder why I look. I think I may have mentioned part of it a few months ago. Sometimes, it would be nice to be saved. It would be unreal to be saved the trouble. I called a phone number about a sweepstake today. That would be nice, someone's got to win these things, right? So, yah, I really have to go now.</p>
