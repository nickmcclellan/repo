<div class="post">
<p>Feeling incredibly unmotivated and lazy now despite my need to work on my term paper. I think in a little bit I'll go down to Insomnia and sit down for a few hours reading some of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Insomnia is this coffee shop that Nicole plays her violin at sometimes. I usually am a bit more motivated when I do stuff at coffee shops for some reason. I think that getting out of my boring room helps alot. Hopefully I'll find me some death, time, and mutability in the sonnets. Oh yah!</p>
<p>Yesterday was worthless. I woke up from the party and had pillow talk with Matt, Missy, and Justin. We all piled into John's car to take Jeremy to the airport so the party really ended at 1pm yesterday when we all decided it was time to go home. I named my journal last week "A Dull Ache and Pain" because for the entire week I've had a very unpleasant persistant headache, as I'm sure you noticed me mention. I don't know where I heard the phrase "a dull ache and pain", but I am certain I didn't think of it. I keep thinking it's from a Vic Chesnut song that garbage covered, but I'm not even certain of that. Oh well, I was thinking of titles like "Faith" or "Get Smart" but that whole attitude shifted toward the end of the week. Whatever, it's always a curious thing for me titling my journal entry. I like looking back on my semester in an episodic way. It's too bad life doesn't always work that way.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm going with Missy to Northpoint to do some shopping. I want to get at least 2 new shirts with which to be sexy in. I feel like my clothes are so boring. I want something new for Spring. An afternoon with Missy is always a joy. We're leaving 6ish on Wednesday morning. Not sure where I'll end up Tuesday night; at Missy's or Sonya's probably. Will have to see. Well, I'm off to Insomnia for now. I wish I could take a nap though...I just don't care about term papers...</p>
<p>I ended up seeing two people today I haven't seen in a while. I saw April and we went to Target together. I talked to her for a while, it was nice seeing her. I encouraged her to move into an apartment with Matt. Hopefully she can find a nice job with which to finance such a move. I know she can do it. On my way out of Insomnia I ran into Allison, this girl I used to drive to school my Junior year of High School. She was going to the Macland Church Party that was quickly making the coffee shop I was at very noisy, thus forcing me to leave. It was a brief encounter, she looked well.

<div class="post">
<p>I woke up this morning to the realization that by the end of the week the United States would be at war. I know it's not a big war, it's probably going to be fought very quickly, but in recent weeks I've fet very much opposed to the war. I don't feel like Saddam Hussein is that much of a threat to us, I just don't. I thought that the diplomatic strides the U.S. were taking were very good. Weapons Inspectors were making some serious headway and it seemed like Saddam was taking the inspections seriously. I just think that the President is giving us a slanted view of this whole conflict. He is putting us out like this stalwart and true country when WE'RE NOT. We're actually quite awful sometimes. I just feel so jaded to this whole thing. I don't feel strongly enough to fight this war, I think it's insane and I think that Bush knows that this war is going to get us out of a recession and that's why he's doing it. I think it's so sad that innocent people need to die because gluttonous Americans want to drive their SUV's. I would like to point out that I drive a shit-mobile...so don't point the finger at me!</p>
<p>In lighter news, I'll be staying at Missy's tomorrow night and leaving for New Orleans early Wednesday. I need to read all the sonnets by tomorrow so that I can make some headway on secondary sources on Sunday and Monday I guess when I return. I figure after reading them once I'll just be re-reading them. Whatever, I wish that I didn't have to work on this paper on my vacation. WHATEVER...</p>
<p>Hope everyone's break is going well...I went shopping with Missy today and got two new shirts with which to club in. I also balanced my checkbook...it's not looking good. Going to need a job BAD when school's out. I'm pretty sure I'll be staying in Athens this summer too. I'll talk more about that later. It's hopefully going to be alot more fun then Marietta...and probably alot hotter. Well, I'm off to do laundry and listen to our insane President...later all.</p>
<p>This house sucks...I'm so ready to move out. My dad and sister refuse to stock the pantry or the fridge. What do they expect me to eat? Do they expect me to go out and fill my belly ravenously like they do? God, I would have settled for something simple. Maybe some pasta, but we don't even have that. Then there's the laundry issue. My sister tells me to wait until she's finished her laundry. I wait. I go out and shop all day, return and start my laundry. She yells at me saying that she wasn't finished (she still had some on the bed that I wasn't sure was laundry or not). Despite waiting all afternoon, she expects me to wait into the wee hours of the morning. Ridiculous! And also she has the gall to throw my stuff out of the washer into a random basket before it is even dry. At least I respected her stuff enough to put it in the washer. I can't wait to go to New Orleans where at least I'll be around my friends.

<div class="post">
<p>I spent the last hour or so after my failed attempt to get alcohol looking over my journal entries over the past six months, but I payed special attention to the entries during the winter break. I noticed on January 4th, 2003 I said, "I feel like things are going to be so nice, but then I have this dark resonance inside. It's telling me things are not going to happen like I think they will." I found that really odd for me to write, having no idea how things would turn out. At the time, I didn't sense necessarily that things were going to be so difficult. I guess that I am very perceptive, moreso then I originally thought.</p>
<p>My sister's not quite the bitch I thought she was. She ended up finishing my laundry for me. I guess she's exonerated in my eyes, for now. I'm burning the Spring Break CD now...only one garbage song, tragic! I posted a notice on my journal that I wouldn't be on Instant Messenger much in New Orleans besides to heckle people while in a drunken state. Hopefully I'll make an entry while drunk and I'll be all revealy and everything! Not much to reveal though...I'm tired now, I think I'll go to sleep.</p>
<hr width="50%" color="#000099" align="center"><br>
<p><em>...This is Missy and I will be gracing Nick's journal with my eloquent writing skills on this Tuesday night before spring break! Of course, Nick, Sonya, Ilya, and I will depart tommorow at 545am to reach our spring break destination, New Orleans, LA. Watching "Spring Break Uncensored" on MTV has definately motivated me to party hard on Bourbon Street-hopefully no Girls Gone Wild camera crews will be scouting out the scene :-o! j/k However, our alcohol will definately keep everyone drunk and debaucherous: We're bringing a suitcase replete w/ a giant bottle of vodka, a 12-pack of Bud Light, a bottle of champagne, a bottle of Citrus twist, Vanilla vodka, Parrot Bay, and Nick's ever famous Everclear! Damn! That's a shitload of alcohol, I must say. Anyway, besides Sonya and Ilya, Nick and I will definately try to hookup! ;) Afterall, it is Spring Break and all--the one time of the year that getting drunk and crazy is acceptable..well, maybe not according to my Mom..hehe..hmm, I hope they don't get a hold of this journal entry..everyone knows what "fun" drama occured the last time they read my journal over Winter Break :p</p>
<p>Well, Nick insists that I write about my boring day...So, I arose to the obnoxious beeping noise of my alarm at 1000am. However, since I was on break, and my parents already departed for work, I took the lesiure of sleeping in till 1100am...I know, I'm such a slacker! I ate a calorie ridden breakfast (so much for my "pre-Spring Break fast"!) and began to cruise through a list of chores my mom left me to complete.:P So, after a day replete w/ chores and an eight-mile run, Nick and I joined Sonya, Ilya, and Sonya's Mom, for a dinner of spagetti and meatballs and a homemade apple pie that was delicious.</p>
<p>When Nick and I arrived back at my house (he's sleeping over tonight), Nick and I revisited the issue of the "message" that my Mom tried to convey to Nick when he was drunk + at John's party. Somehow, she came up with the crazy idea that maybe Nick and I were drunk at the party, and that's why we didn't get the "message!"..OMG..and she was right..believe it or not...that was the night the room seemed like it was spinning around my head at a million miles per hour. I felt like a 5-year-old on some McDonald's playground on a centerfuge, back in the 1980's. My Dad would spin that thing around till it probably almost fell off the cement cylinder it rested upon! Hmm..so I guess I could say she figured out why Nick never got "the message"...hehe After that confrontation, Nick and I ran upstairs like a bunch of 8-year-olds giggling after someone said the word "sex." Well, since it is 1239am, and I attempt to wake Nick up at 515, I better get my booty into bed! Gnite to all!</em>

<div class="post">
<p>I'm in New Orleans! It's very nice here, we're two blocks from Bourbon Street. I'm sure we'll be explore that whole region tonight. I'm drinking my mixed Everclear drink right now! I had so much fun tonight. I saw Tee for the first time in over a year. We went to this Mexican Restaurant with her roommate Reva. I was really excited about seeing her again. Missy got a chance to meet one of my very good high school friends. There are not many people I respect more then Tckoy Jones. She's a fine, beautiful, sexy, sophisticated Black woman. I was disappointed to hear she won't be the next Dr. Ruth, but I guess I'll have to settle with her being the next Whitney Houston. Driving back to the hotel I felt very happy, like I was having alot of fun and my friends weren't gunnysacking anything against me.</p>
<p>Not sure what I'll be doing tonight, hoping that fun will be involved. I don't think I'll be able to get online and have drunken conversations with people, that's too bad. I'd really like to do that. Local calls cost $.75 and Sonya would appreciate it if I didn't charge too much to her card. I really hope some people call me though during expected drunken times. I'll be roaming, so I won't MAKE calls, but I will be drunk enough to TAKE them. I wish people would call me, you know, certain people, certain people that would make things more interesting for me.</p>
<p>The Everclear with the mixed Coke really isn't that bad. I'm going to get so tipsy in a couple of minutes. Everclear has a tendency of making me VERY drunk. I'm listening to mp3's while Missy is ironing. I hope I don't get tired tonight...I feel kinda tired. I want to dance or make out with someone, that would be nice. Not a woman though...I mean, I've been doing that alot lately. I mean, I'm still gay, I still get that electric tingle when it's with another guy. It would be nice to make out with a random hot guy...doubtful that will happen, however. Oh well, I'm feeling really on my way to GONE now. Things are very wavy...yes.</p>
<p>Now that I'm on my way, I am wondering, what do I write about now? I can't write about anything I want to write about. I can't write about the dreams I've been having. Last night, it was such a nice dream, it makes me want to go back to my "Sleep" phase where I just wish that I didn't have to deal with shit anymore. I don't see why I can't have at least one dream. You know? Just one dream to come true. That would be GREAT! I know the one, and I probably shouldn't even consider it because he is of SCUM, but I'm hopeless, absolultely HOPELESS.
<p>In other news, Jeremy called me today from Sicily. Thank God, I really appreciated the call. Jeremy is AOK cool baby. Everclear is of scum too. I once mentioned Jim was of scum too. Why do I feel so bad? Why can't someone call and make me feel so much better? No lo se.</p>
<p>In closing, I was tired tonight and will hopefully be more drunk tomorrow. I got naked in the spa while Ilya, Sonya, and Missy hid my bathing suit. I had no problem walking out of the spa with my hot naked ass getting my suit. Oh yah! I'm not afraid to show off my shrunkin' ten inch member! OMG! I'm so lying, I just feel very not ashamed of my body right now. Whatever, no one called me, who cares...later, bye, sleepy time where good dreams will certainly come...

<p>Yo homie, it's not Thursday, baby, it's Friday. Despite the fact that I've missed an entry the entire day of Thursday, I will fill you in anyways. Tonight I made out with the "skank ass." Yep, he was not pretty. Missy and I went to the gay bar and saw this really hot guy (from Yale!) named Chris. He was so hot, omg! I was too shy (despite 4 drinks with Everclear) to talk to him. Missy had to initiate the conversation with him. I talked with him, but his friend was "skank ass" and he started hitting on me so I felt all unloved so I proceeded to make out with him. I wasn't going to bring that "skank ass" to the hotel lobby, so I left his "skank ass" on the street and proceeded to Missy's club of choice where she met Jason. Missy and Jason made out and shit and Missy is not here with me now :-( She's with Jason at his hotel room. I hope she avoids gobs of semen...</p>
<p>Tonight was fun. Today was ok. Gunnysacking is occuring, however. Not between Missy and I though. I got online tonight and talked to several people, the most fun being Laura from Mary Lyndon. We talked about mutual friend's small penises. I love the internet. I takes you so far away from the tiny room in which to get drunk in and takes you to the several rooms across the world in which your most favorite people are in. It's too bad I didn't talk to anyone I really wanted to talk to. It's too bad people are too scared to CALL me (even though I forgot to bring my cell phone out, opps!). Like I give a shit. Whatever, I just wish I could have closer friends with me here. I feel like if Matt Stephens was here (aka Nice Matt) I would have so much fun. He would go to the gay club and dance with me, no problem. I also think that if the club was like Boneshakers, I would have hooked up with the fine ass guy instead of the "skank ass." Well, after this is published you better be all apologizing for not calling me or hooking me up with non-"skank ass." I guess the internet highlight of the night would be when I talked to Laura, so I will upload our conversation. God, now that I think about it, I better not, at least until I FILTER out sensitive information. I always be exchanging sensitive information. It's not like sensitive "I like this person" information, hells no. It's more like "this person's penis is like..." blah blah information. Oh, God, it's not anyone I'VE been with, it's more here-say, yo (Though I did talk about past penis during my Everclear induced drunkeness.) I am so gramatically correct (I think). I'm off to bed now. Please call me...you know...my sister called me and I felt so special...so call me so I feel better! Get the picture folks! Just because I'm roaming doesn't mean I don't want to talk yo. Save me from the skank asses!

<p>Yah, last night was interesting. Won't get into details. I had awful nightmares about the month of April. It's going to suck. I have so many papers to write. I know next weekend I have a paper I need to write, and it has to be PERFECT! God, I don't know if I can take it...but I will find out, won't I? Alot of changes are coming up. I'm moving away from home. I'm getting a new job. I'm going to be working closely with Lambda this summer as well. It's going to be a real interesting transition, kind of like a second "coming of age." I will be aiming for very work heavy weekends with of course party distractions. Anyways, this has preoccupied my mind for most of the day, I should think of other things on my vacation.</p>
<p>We have had shitty service at New Orleans restaurants. They really blow. Right now, we're snacking on Easter candy. Sonya and Ilya are making mindless chatter and Missy is attempting to talk to me but I feel very ick now. I don't feel like getting drunk and going out. Dina is supposed to call me and we're supposed to meet up and go out. I think she's forgotten or something though. Sigh...we'll have to see what happens. I drank before going out tonight to dinner. My Spring Break party was a bit upset with my obnoxious behavior, oh well. I think all's well. I kinda wish I could sleep in tonight, I want to have fun but I feel so stuffed right now that if I drank it's just going to make me feel grosser. Ick ick ick...</p>
<p>My sister's going to be surprised to see me home tomorrow. I told her I'd be back Sunday. I'm going to scare her I think. Sigh...I'm off to see if my peeps want to get out and get rowdy. Until next time...
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, March 22nd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>The break is over and my month of work begins. Tonight I'm going to set out some necessary goals for the next month so I'm sure nothing is missed because I have plenty I need to work on. This is my test, I feel. If I can survive this, I can survive college. If I can survive this, I can finally honestly say I am grown up.</p>
<p>Alright, so things have ended pretty...um, well, I can't say. You know, it wouldn't be cool, but I will say a little bit. Certainly Sonya and Ilya know that things didn't end well. I won't get into any details, you know, that would go against the whole theme for this break, you know, "Tounge 'N' Cheek." I will just say I spent the trip home thinking about all the people I consider to be really awesome friends. I think it would have been great if someone like Matt or John was in New Orleans with me and Missy. Well, I think that Efua and Dayana would have been so much fun to hang out with. I could see us all getting along, hanging out together, doing things TOGETHER (not showering together). We also would all interact. Dayana is really cool and is alot of fun going out with. Efua is very nice. Missy would have had someone else to pal around with (I know I was obnoxious). It would have been nice if they came. Oh well, I had fun despite their absense.</p>
<p>Well, I wait patiently for my sister to arrive home so I can scare the shit of out her. I am now off to do that goal crap and also to finish some laundry...work on the webpage of course. I hope all appreciate my "Spring Break" journal. I made a big production out of the thing last year and I sorta did the same this year. I wrote a shit load...some if it drunk so don't take it too seriously. Let me just say I HATE it when I write about what type of guy I want, God, I was thinking about that when I was driving home. I can be such a pussy sometimes. Yuck. Ok, anyways...enjoy! Hope everyone else's break was just as cheeky as mine ;-/
