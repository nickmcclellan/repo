<div class="lefttitle">Page Design</div>
<p>If there is one characteristic of my page design that I would highlight, it would be my willingness to try different things.<br>
<br>
Each one of my page layouts are distinctive because of their reliance on visual elements to better convey content.<br>
<br>
As a visual journalist, I hope to help shape future stories with my instincts of design.</p>
