It's hard to believe that one year ago, I left Georgia, but it's true. Forgive me while I take a moment to reflect.

I've moved around a lot in my life. I was born in Kettering, Ohio, after which I spent less than a year in an apartment with my mother and father before moving to South Florida. I spent most of my childhood there. We lived in Ft. Lauderdale until I was in second grade, when I moved to Davie. Partly through my fifth grade year, we moved to Boca Raton, probably my favorite Florida location. I could have really laid roots down there. It wasn't long until our family moved to Marietta, Georgia, at the end of my Sixth Grade year. It was rough moving around, but fortunately we stuck around in Georgia long enough for me to grow fond of it.

If I could call any part of Georgia home, it would be Athens, where I went to college for four years. It was the first time I'd ever lived on my own, away from my family. I met the most amazing people there, friends I still speak to today. I was never dissatisfied with Athens, until the end. After four years, I just had to leave.

I used to have a Web site before this one. I had an intensily personal Blog which is (hopefully) worlds different than this one. At the time, I was grappling with my post-graduation plans and trying desperately to find a job after getting a late start in the resume game. I had some repeat phone interviews that gave me hope of finding work, but as July marched forward, I never got that emancipating phone call and I had to accept the fact that I was going to have to make other arragements. I ended the Blog on the note that I was leaving Athens, partically defeated and unsure of my future. I moved to Ohio, with my mother, for what could have been a very long time.

Leaving Georgia was a critical junction in my life. Conceivably, I could have stayed. It would have been easy for me. My friend, Genevieve, told me that I could live with her if I had to. I could have found some sort of work in Athens. I could have compromised on my insistance of finding work outside of the South. On a day like today, I wonder what my life would be like now if I had not left Georgia behind.

I think I would be somewhat happier, in some sense. One regret I have of leaving is missing my good friends for which now I must go to great lengths to see. It would be nice to see some people more often, even it means having to live in the dirty South. I think I would have eventually found a job. I could be living in a small, Southern town even more obscure than Visalia. Heck, I could be in Augusta, a somewhat acceptable Georgia city, still partying with my friend Leena and cavorting with my glorious sorority girlfriend Laura (prospects I would have weighed seriously had they been on the table).

Ultimately, though, I feel leaving Georgia was the best decision for me. In leaving, I proved I could do it, I proved that I could change my circumstances and survive in a new place completely on my own. If I had stayed in Georgia and not heeded my desire to leave, I feel a part of me would have been compromised. I think I may feel trapped, almost relegated to the South and incapable of leaving to pursue my dreams of a better place.

While Visalia is no Washington D.C. (my idealized post-Georgia refuge), I still made it here. I know that when it comes time for me to move on again, I will remember how difficult it was to leave Georgia and how I nonetheless acheived it. I know that if I am unhappy here, I can move elsewhere. I know this because I have done it before.

I don't know if I will ever go back to Georgia. Lately, I have been thinking about Graduate School, and Georgia is on the short list of places I'm considering. While it would be a pleasure to go back and cavort with friends I so seldom see, I wouldn't predict a comeback. I'm having too much fun out here to make any promises.
