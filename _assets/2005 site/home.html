<p><b>July 9, 2006</b>: I have recently finished a Web site for my cousin, you can view it <a href="http://lauramariejones.com/" target="_parent">here</a>. If you are intersted in my talents and would like to hire me to build a site, please contact me via my e-mail below.</p>

<div class="sectionhead">Welcome to endlessone.com</div>
<p>Thank you for visiting my professional website. Unfortunately, this form of the site is no longer useful for me and will be changing in the next several months. I expect to launch a full website next summer that will be much more interactive than this.</p>
<p>You will find more information on my career aspirations there. There will be more dynamic examples of my web design work. I will include a link to a more varied array of page design samples. Also, an updated resume will be available.</p>
<p>As far as this portal, it may be eliminated in the next couple of months as I begin to test my new site.</p>
<p>Again, thank you for showing an interest in me. Come back in the future to see what I am up to.</p>
