<div class="sectionhead">Welcome to endlessone.com</div>
<p><img class="front" src="nick.jpg" width="150" height="150" align="left">Thank you for visiting my professional website. I have established this space to display examples of my web design, page design, and writing. As a recent graduate and an aspiring web designer, editor, and writer, I hope that very soon I will be applying my skills to an employer that can benefit from my potential.<br>
<br>
I graduated in May with degrees in Journalism and English along with a minor in Spanish. During my college years, I wrote and edited for a magazine and also worked for the daily student-run independent newspaper, the Red & Black. In my coursework for Advanced Newspaper Design, I learned to apply the basic principles of good news design. With my fresh experience and willingness to innovate, I hope to further distinguish my skills in editing and design.<br>
<br>
You will find much of my coursework and extracurricular work here on the website. I have also posted links to sites I have designed myself.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in my work and would like to speak with me about a possible position, please visit the resume page for information on how you can contact me.<br>
<br>
Thank you for visiting.
