<div class="lefttitle">Web Design</div>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I have had a passion for web design. For the past four years I have designed my own personal web page. I have also constructed a web site for a client to display coursework photography.<br>
<br>
By combining my distinctive design taste with my skills in web design, I have produced succinct, content-driven web sites.<br>
<br>
I look forward to applying these skills in the work environment.</p>

<p>"The Photography of Laura Jones" illustrates how my innovative design and the artistic depth of the content can meet to communicate the merits of the professional's work. This site was used to display coursework photography for potential employers. The site utilizes Internet Explorer Chroma filters to achieve transparent background for text, so it is <strong>best viewed in Internet Explorer, preferably on a PC</strong> (can't stress this enough).</p>
<p>Ms. Jones has recently relocated to Las Vegas and I have been working on a new web page to meet her needs.</p>
<div class="sectionhead" align="center"><strong>Other Web Design Examples</strong></div>
<p>In addition to Ms. Jones's website, I have maintained a personal web page for four years. Currently, I am also producing a new site for Ms. Jones.</p>
<p>I would like to develop my web design talents by continuing my freelance efforts, sharpening my existing talents and experimenting with different types of web enhancing elements.</p>
