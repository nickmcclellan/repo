<div class="lefttitle">Writing</div>
<p>I have always had a desire to write. My main objective for obtaining my English degree was to sharpen my critical thinking and writing skills.<br>
<br>
The writings samples I have compiled convey some of my academic, creative and professional objectives in writing. As you can see, I do not limit myself to one style.<br>
<br>
As a lifetime writer, I hope to continue to sharpen my skills.</p>
