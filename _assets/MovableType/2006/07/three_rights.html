<p>I haven't gone many places since my marathon last month, so I figured I would venture out this weekend. Some very good college friends were visiting San Francisco and I couldn't miss the opportunity to see them. I jumped into my car (after forgetting like 3 essential items before leaving) and finally I was off.</p>

<p>I've been to San Francisco twice before, and as a non-California native, I think I finally got it right this time. The first time I visited I came with a friend who matriculates at Stanford University in Palo Alto. We took the Caltrain up and ventured to Fisherman's Warf, Pier 39 and Ghirardelli Square. We had a fabulous, long day, but we hit most of the tourist traps that offered little lasting satisfaction. Bummer.</p>

<p>For New Year's, I went with a friend from Sacramento to party it up in the city. I thought for sure we would see the better parts of the city, seeing as alcohol would be involved. It was very rainy on New Year's Eve, but I made it to San Francisco in plenty of time. My friend, however, was rerouted several times because of landslides on the interstate, so she was 4 hours late! I was stuck in the city, all by myself, on New Year's Eve! I ventured around where I had landed (which was, oddly enough, the one place I wanted to see on my first visit, the Castro district) and spent copious amounts of time perusing Safeway and plugging away on my computer at Starbucks. When my friend finally did show up, we had a fabulous time, but I feel like I could have done more.</p>

<p>This time around, my friends and I poked around the Haight Ashbury and it was very much worthwhile (enough for me to shrug off parking illegally and incurring a $60 parking ticket). For any of you who aren't away, the Haight Ashbury is this area in San Francisco where all the hippies went to die. I saw so many old hippies! Also, lots of dogs strapped to parking meters on the street, psychedelic painted vans and all sorts of beatnik-themed shops (and a few too many corporate sellouts, sadly).</p>

<p>We ate at this very cool sandwich place and I got this delicious lettuce, fried green tomato and eggplant parmesan sandwich. We looked at some of the shops, I got a comfy shirt from American Apparel. We went to Amoeba Music where I feel like we spent a whole hour looking and listening to music. I finally picked up the new Snow Patrol album as well as <em>Republic</em>, an older New Order album that was on clearance for only $3 used. I also noticed the Flaming Lips had released a special album entitled The Fearless Freaks, which according to the album's intro was released on a limited basis at SXSW. It contained a haunting live version of "The Observer," one of my favorite Lips songs, as well as a rare track titled "Enthusiasm for Life Defeats Existential Fear."</p>

<p>After this, I drove my friends back to their hotel and I took on the arduous task of leaving the city. It was hard enough getting to Union Square when I arrived. You might find this hard to believe, but for a left-leaning city like San Francisco, you can't make any left turns. It makes it very hard for a newbie like myself to find his way out of the Labyrinth by instead of making a left turn, having to make three right turns.</p>

<p>It was great visiting, I wish I didn't have to leave so soon. It would be nice spending the night again. I did venture to my favorite Safeway to buy some Soy Crisps. It's a shame I ate them so quickly...</p>
