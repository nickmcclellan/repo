<p>That's the number one thing I find annoying about people asking me about the marathon. They expect me the boil down a five hour and eighteen minute experience into just a few words. It's impossible! So many things happen to you during a marathon, and it took me a few days to process the whole thing myself. Well, I think I'm ready to write about it, so here goes.</p>
<p>I didn't actually look at the course map until a week before I ran the race. For some reason, knowing anything about the race was immaterial to me until I raised enough money before my fundraising deadline (by the way, I raised $2,640 for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society). Once that was squared away, I started to actually consider running the marathon which, surprisingly, was a very funny thing. When I first looked at that map, I started laughing out loud. We run all over downtown San Diego, and when that's all done with, it's still only 10 miles! There's 16.2 miles of hell right after that!</p>
<p>Team in Training did a send-off for us. I brought tofu, rice and veggies to the potluck, but not many people had much (too bad, more for me). We got our singlets and race info. Early Saturday morning we met at the Holiday Inn on Plaza Drive. We took a slow bus to San Diego and my mentor gave me some useful advice for running my first marathon (which he had done only months earlier).</p>
<p>Sometime before or after going over the Grapevine, I was listening to &quot;The Wand&quot; off the new Flaming Lips album, tapping my feet on the ground, when I started thinking to myself...<em>I forgot my running shoes!</em> No joke. Worst possible thing you could do before running a marathon, and it happened to me. For a split second, I thought to myself, &quot;How the hell could you do something so stupid?!&quot; But a second later, I regained my composure and started to think of a solution to my problem. I would just have to buy a new pair of shoes at the Expo.</p>
<p>San Diego is very nice. It reminded me of Atlanta with lots and lots of sun. I frantically combed over the Expo looking for a New Balance booth, but I had to settle on a pair of Mizunos that actually looked very similar to the shoes I had been running in all season. After I got my timing chip, Rock 'n' Roll Marathon commemorative shirt and number, I went back to the hotel for a nap before heading out to the TNT Pasta Party at the convention center. After filling up on carbs, I was off to bed.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessone.com/blog/sd_course_map_06.gif"><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/sd_course_map_06.gif" width="275" length="355" hspace="10" align="left" border="1"></a>Up until that point, it was all still a big joke. I was still laughing about it at the Pasta Party, a mere 10 hours before the race started. But on the race day morning, there's nothing left to do but run. I got dressed, headed out to the bus at about 3:45 in the morning and got to the start line around 4. We had about two hours before start, so I just laid there, listening to my iPod and waited. I was in such a daze, I really felt like I could run the whole day, so I'm glad I wasn't super tired and pessimistic or it would have been so much more difficult.</p>
<p>Once we were all corralled at the front, there was no turning back. I was in corral 12, but unlike the Peachtree Road Race, which takes almost 45 minutes to get from your corral to the starting line, it was only about 7 minutes after the actual start time that I was off and running. The first few miles were not too difficult. I just ignored the new shoes and pretended not to care. I was so focused on the bands playing at the side of the road and the spectators that I didn't even notice how slowly the mile numbers trickled by.</p>
<p>I thought that maybe I would be so preoccupied at the beginning thinking about the incredible distance I was trying to surmount, but I was really ambivalent at that point. I was just in a daze, thinking about a lot of different things. I mostly took the race in 2 to 3 mile increments. At mile 2 I had some Powerade. At mile 5, I took a PowerGel and had some water. And then 2 miles later, I took some more Powerade. It's easier if you think of the race like that instead of taking on the whole behemoth at once.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I hit mile 11 that I started to have some problems. I started getting a blister on my foot, which I mostly ignored. I was also hitting a point in the race where the course got kind of boring (we were running on an Interstate!) so I started to drift. I would walk through all the water stations, but I started walking 2 minutes instead of just one. I got to see my coach at around this time, so that was great motivation to keep me going up to the half.</p>
<p>The race dragged on from here, and around mile 18 I started doing intervals of walking and running. One of my team members was running at a pretty consistent pace, so she kept passing me while I was running and I kept passing her when I would start up again at a 9 minute pace. We tried to keep each other motivated, and it was great to get that encouragement at that point in the race.</p>
<p>At about mile 21 and 22, we hit this point where we did a small loop and sort of double backed on the course. I was so finished at this point, it was at this moment that I hit my &quot;wall.&quot; It was pure will power that drove me on from here. I tried to run to mile 24 and walk to 25 and put up a final sprint through to 26.2, but I mostly did my intervals. I got some encouragement from my coaches and some pointers on the finish line that were very useful.</p>
<p>But at this point, you got to realize, I was a physical wreck. I had been doing intervals for a while, and it had gotten to be so difficult to switch from running to walking and vice versa. Every time I would start running again, it was like I was pulling my legs out of stiffening concrete. I was so ready to collapse.</p>
<p>After we entered to Marine depot, my coach told me that when I saw a tunnel, I could expect to see the finish line just beyond it. Once I saw the tunnel, I was so determined to finish, I quit walking and start sprinting to the finish. I think I got to about a 6:45 pace, my best of the entire race &#8212; I was so through with it. Once I passed over the finish line, I swear it was such a rush. You think you would have something amazing to punctuate that moment, but I was so relieved and I could quite honestly have burst into tears at the moment if I had tried hard enough.</p>
<p>See, that's the thing. I learned in that moment why people are crazy enough to run marathons. I didn't want to cry because I was sad. I didn't want to cry because I was depressed, either. I wanted to cry, I believe, because I was mourning the fact that this marathon was so difficult. I took myself to my limit and then pushed myself four extra miles, and for what? There was no reclining chairs at the finish line, there was no handsome reward (except for this really nifty medal they gave us). All there was was this incredible feeling that I had survived something physically grueling and the promise that I would recover from it. I felt like, had this been some life or death situation, where I had survived some horrible ordeal, like being stranded on some mountain or something, I would experience the same exact feeling. Equal parts relief, exhaustion and triumph.</p>
<p>I got myself a bagel, (a medal), some blister relief shoes and my personal things. I called my mother and a few of my friends and then made my way back to the hotel room for a much deserved nap. After you run a marathon, you feel not unlike a midget on stilts &#8212; I felt like I could fall over at any moment. Short distances, like hunting around the TNT Victory Party for a vegetarian alternative to ribs and chicken, became major endurance treks. Oh, if I could have just sat down for 3 days...</p>
<p>But I made it. Recovery is going well, I started running again on Monday (I know, I'm crazy), and I am even planning on running a marathon again sometime. I would like to get myself more prepped for the next time around, though. I was just running this one to finish. Next time around, I want to break 4:30 :-)</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who supported me in my marathon goal! I couldn't have done it without you! </p>

I remember you didn't like the tread mill at the time.  What you have accomplished is simply awesome (and I mean that in the etymological sense, not in the teenage "that's so cool" sense)and I have great respect for your achievement.  Love ya! </p>
