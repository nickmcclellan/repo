                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p><img alt="control.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/control.jpg" width="300" height="442" align="right" class="insetright" />I've been dying to see this movie for months. And finally, the celluloid gods smiled down on me.</p>

<p>See, I live in a "small town." Well, it's not that small really, but it's far from what some might consider civilized society. I usually associate this with decent concert venues, a multitude of delicious restaurant fare (especially vegetarian) and most importantly a decent independent cinema. I mean, come on! I lived in Dayton, Ohio, the armpit of American civilization (and interestingly enough my birthplace), and even they had a kick ass independent cinema!</p>

<p>Well, Visalia finally brought a decent independent film to town. At the beginning of the month, <em>Control</em> came to town. For two nights only, the black-and-white film by noted photographer Anton Corbijn, came to Visalia and I was front and center during the first showing. The film chronicles the formation and demise of the band Joy Division, a post-punk British rock band whose influence can be heard in many of the artists that climbed to prominance in the 80s and beyond.</p>

<p>The film focuses its narrative on Ian Curtis, the ill-fated lead singer who desperately wants to escape his drab life in Macclesfield, England. Soon after joining musicians Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner, Curtis finds what might be his golden ticket. After adding Stephen Morris and dropping the name Warsaw, Joy Division is born. The band rocket to success in England amongst contemporaries as the Sex Pistols and Iggy Pop.</p>

<p>Things turn sour for Curtis as he is diagnosed with epilepsy and has to undergo a brutal drug regiment in order to handle the demanding tour schedule of Joy Division. He also becomes swept up in a love affair with journalist Annik Honor√©, causing significant strain with is wife Deborah Woodruff, who lives in Macclesfield with her and Curtis' daughter.</p>

<p>Of course, the plot of the film spirals to inevitable end of Curtis, who hangs himself on the eve of the band's American tour. This tragedy was a great blow to music, as the world will never know what potential Curtis would have had if he could have risen above his internal struggles. So true for other musicians as well.</p>

<p>What separates this film from the parade of other musical biopics is Corbijn, who has photographed and filmed musicians for much of his professional career. Responsible for album art such as U2's Joshua Tree and music videos such as Depeche Mode's "Personal Jesus," Corbijn makes this film just about the coolest I have every seen. The first half of the film feels like a photographer's portfolio, as even routine scenes of crossing the street are infused with such artistry that would take your breath away.</p>

<p>But the best thing about this film is the music. Not only does it introduce you to the wonderful band Joy Division, but also the artists which influenced the band's development. Oh, to live at the dawn of the 80s. I can think of so many worse things. If you have any sense in your brain, this will bring you back to the film over and over again.</p>

<p>The demise of Joy Division led Hook, Sumner and Morris to form New Order, which carried on in the shadow of Joy Division, influencing and changing the course of music in its own right. I've always been a fan of New Order, but not so much Joy Division. Happily, after this film, that has changed.</p>

<p>Pick this one up, definitely.</p>

<p>New Order, one of the most enigmatic and inventive bands of the last 30 years, have finally called it quits. The band formed from the band Joy Division after the suicide of Ian Curtis. They have produced hits such as "Blue Monday," "True Faith," "Crystal," "Age of Consent" and "Bizarre Love Triangle," by far my favorite. Bassist Peter Hook announced the band's split on his MySpace blog on Wednesday:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=180575671&blogID=262679181&MyToken=c77a2624-ef19-44e9-8db5-ce4cc439be11">life goes on!</a><br>
<a href="http://myspace.com/180575671">http://myspace.com/180575671</a>

<p>well here we go again another action packed week.</p>

<p>i suppose it was the interview with clint boon that started it all off hed asked me for a few words on perry farrells satellite party single dogstar [which he thought was great] so i went on and lo and behold mentioned the N>O> split so i suppose because it was me sayin it it was out at last. im relieved really hated carryin on as normal with an awful secret so lets move on shall we?</blockquote></p>

<p>It was as recently as Friday night that I was driving with Natalie rocking out to "Age of Consent" on the lonely drive back from Fresno. I've even turned her on to the band, burning her a copy of <em>Power, Corruption & Lies</em>, the bands seminal 1983 album that beget "Blue Monday," which still influences artists in the realm of Trance and House music.</p>

<p>New Order is part of my own personal trifecta of musical groups that I'm always citing: garbage, New Order and The Cure. Garbage announced Friday that their long-expected greatest hits album <em>Absolute Garbage</em> would be hitting stores soon and The Cure have been riding rumors of a new album since the whole of 2006. I had heard New Order was keen on releasing a new album from their <em>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</em> recording session, but now that is a big question.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time New Order has ducked from the music scene. Between the release of <em>Republic</em> and the recording of <em>Get Ready</em> in 1993 and 1998 respectively, New Order seemed a lost relic of the '80s. Hopefully they can demonstrate the resilience and fortitude to reunite and forge another album to close out the decade, or at least bring us into the next. They are talented and timeless musicians and I am very sorry I may never have the opportunity to see them play again.</p>

<p>For now, I'll leave you with the video for "Krafty," from the <em>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</em> album, which helped to rescue me from a endless, consuming depression.</p>

It's been a while since I've bought an album that has just wowed me. I don't buy music that often and there are very few albums a year that make it on my must-have list. The two albums I have recently purchased, The Killer's <em>Sam's Town</em> and the Scissor Sister's <em>Ta-dah</em> were very good, but nothing has blown me away like Nada Surf's 2003 album <em>Let Go</em>.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is not one I have bought yet, though I am only a glance at the music store away from snatching this us. My friend Ali (who I am so happy to say I'm going to see this weekend in Sac-of-tomatoes) sent the mp3's to me via AIM. At first, it was just to supplement my Nada Surf collection, which included a few stray songs, "Popular" and "Bacardi", as well as their 2005 album <em>The Weight Is A Gift</em>, which I liked a lot.</p>

<p>The album came out amid very little promotion and would fit most accurately in the indie scene. I don't remember hearing any song from the album back in '03, but from what I understand, the track "Inside of Love" got moderate airplay overseas, but obviously not enough to overcome to oft-spoken phase, "Nada Surf? Those guys that did 'Popular?'" They are so much more than "Popular."</p>

<blockquote><em>Let Go</em>
<ol>
<li>Blizzard of '77
<li>Happy Kid
<li>Inside of Love
<li>Fruit Fly
<li>Blonde on Blonde
<li>Hi-Speed Soul
<li>Killian's Red
<li>Way You Wear Your Head
<li>Neither Heaven nor Space
<li>L√† Pour √áa
<li>Treading Water
<li>Paper Boats
</ol></blockquote>

<p><em>Let Go</em> is a classic indie-rock album. Every track on the album is inspired and absolutely unique. In the past year, I have had many experience, and it seems with every one of them I accompanied it with a track from this album. In my eternal running effort, "Inside of Love" was just one of a myriad of songs that brought me outside to train weekly for the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon last June. "Neither Heaven nor Space" and "Treading Water" are songs I picked up shortly before my hikes up Alta Peak and Mt. Whitney respectively. I can't help but listen to those songs and think about the heights I reached. Palling around with Natalie, my fabulous roommate, I have partied out to "Blizzard of '77," "Hi-Speed Soul" and even the slow-paced "Blonde on Blonde," which is featured in our favorite Queerstrokes movie <em>Summer Storm</em>.</p>

<p>But I think it was "Fruit Fly" that put me over the edge. Ok, this song is written exactly about what you think it is. The guy leaves a bag of fruit on the table way too long, and when he throws it away, he laments on the fate of the wayward fruit flies that remain. Of course, the flies chime in with buzzing guitars and great enthusiasm:</p>

<blockquote><em>Geometric patterns<br>
Smearing out of control<br>
Only have enough gas left<br>
For the beer can to the bowl<br>
What can you do but go on?</em><br>
<br>
"Fruit Fly"<br>
Nada Surf</blockquote>

<p>This album is just so freaking original and it gives me so much joy. Currently rocking out to the slow jam "Killian's Red," just because it's a great song. </p>

<p>I don't know why I get such a rush from albums everyone else has long forgot. Like last night, on my way to go out after work I pop in New Order's <em>Power, Corruption & Lies</em>, their breakthrough album from 1983. I can't think of anyone else who might have the slightest interest in "Age of Consent" (but maybe the track "Blue Monday"), but still, shouldn't I be rocking out to Beck or something? My taste in music is so strange, I just thought I'd share.</p>

<p>Anyways, pick up <em>Let Go</em> if you haven't already. If you are into Nada Surf, you won't regret it.</p>

<p>A few nights ago, for some reason, Tears for Fears' '80s hit "Head Over Heels" came up in conversation. Since someone on the copy desk didn't recall ever hearing the song, I proceeded to queue it on YouTube for all to hear. After everyone cleared out, I actually sat down and watched the video to that song, which was very odd. I submit it here: Is this really a music video? Was Tears for Fears being clever or have these music video clich√©s truly left us as we progressed in time.</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
