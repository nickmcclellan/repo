<p>There's no reason why I shouldn't have written this a month ago but I have just been on a break. 26.2 miles takes a lot out of you, and so does working 50 plus hours a week. Things are finally slowing down now and a lot of interesting changes are coming down the pipe. Before I go into all that, it's important that I at least address my major accomplishment, at least once before it fades into obscurity.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, March 25, and I woke up at my sister's friend Tyler's apartment feeling just a tiny bit uneasy about the race. I had spent the three weeks prior taking it real easy. After finishing a grueling training schedule, I had hoped to keep up the pace in the weeks closing in on the big day, but pain in my leg had forced me to rein in my ambitious plans. I woke up that morning thinking that maybe I had eroded a lot of the ground I had worked so hard to gain footing upon. Part of that was true.</p>

<p>Regardless, I could only race with the body I had and not the body I wish I could have had. My leg was thankfully not bothersome on race day and I made my way down to the MARTA station in Midtown Atlanta at the fine hour of 5:30 in the morning. The race was an hour and a half away.</p>

<p>I arrived at 6 a.m. and called Marilia. She had it real rough, a lot worse than me. I'd done this before. A marathon for me would be 26.2 miles of deja vu. Sure, it was going to be rough, but at least I knew I had once stood (barely) at the finish line. For Marilia, finding the finish was not a done deal. Also, catching the train on time was also missing from the cards â€” she arrived 10 minutes before the race. I tossed her her things, gave her a Tylenol 8-Hour, a kiss and I told her I loved her and good luck. It was her race and I couldn't run it for her. Besides, I had a race to run myself.</p>

<p><img alt="marathon2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathon2.jpg" width="256" height="384" align="right" class="insetright" />It wasn't until the mass of people started to finally eek its way to the start line that it finally hit me: I was really running this. I got a chill down my spine and I felt something I didn't expect I'd feel in the warm familiarity of the brisk Atlanta morning: I was in this all by myself. Sure, Marilia was probably a half-mile behind me there, but just like the first race, I ran this one alone. The track was familiar. My sister was a text message away, but I was still in this for myself. I somehow thought that running on the streets of Atlanta would be like seeing every neighbor and friend cheering me on, that somehow an envelope of everything I remember from my years in Georgia would whisk me joyfully to the finish line in a rush of joy and triumph. It wasn't like that at all. I had to run every single one of those miles and all the city really afforded me the comfort of was a few moments along the lines of, "Oh, Decatur...I've been there."</p>

<p>Well, I didn't have a cheering section, granted, but I didn't have one in Yokohl Valley either and I had some of my best runs out there. I could do this. The early race went very well. I kept up a very great pace and walked through many water stations for maybe 45 seconds or less. The only major train wreck came from the race itself â€” no Powerade! It was promised but the race barely delivered. At best we'd get a heavily watered down sprinkling of Powerade powder and at worse we got no water at all! Between mile 3 and mile 8, there was no water at all! And the worst part of it all was the signs promising water that didn't actually deliver until 3 miles later! It was awful, but it was a real boon for me. I never walked substantially until the half. I was in prime form.</p>

<p>Sadly, the hills of Decatur hit my pride hard and I began to conserve my energies. Conserving began to weaken my resolve and I started to scale back my goal from 4:30 to 4:45 and 4:50 (4:59?). I walked a lot toward the end and I only have myself to blame. Besides that, water stations were never reliable and Powerade was absolutely no where to be found in the second half of the race. I had relied very much on Gatorade in my training so I'm almost certain that had an effect on my energy. How much, I'm not certain, but I still tried to stick it through.</p>

<p><img alt="marathon3.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathon3.jpg" width="255" height="384" align="right" align="insetright" />In the end, I finished the race in 5 hours and 4 minutes â€” a full 15 minutes faster than I did in San Diego almost one year ago. It was a fabulous end to a marathon effort. I am very pleased with my finish and I only hope to roll back my time 15 or 30 minutes more in my next race. My goal is to surmount a marathon again before the end of the year. I have my eyes on the Sacramento race in December but I may also try for a summer race along with a quicker training schedule.</p>

<p>Also, I am considering rearranging any future marathon training schedule. Distance is no longer taboo for me. Fourteen miles is a drop in the bucket, and 18 to 20 is also very doable, even now after slumming it for almost a month. I would like to start running longer distances and working on speed in my future training. I know I can make 4:30, I just need to chip away at it more and more.</p>

<p>For now, I'm taking a serious break. My leg pain really worried me and I think I've been overdoing it so long. I think I may have slipped into a postrun depression too, which is kind of unsettling. An almost, "What's the point?" feeling has settled over me. I run so much, it's like there is no end. The race was the end, in this sense, so what next? I'm still thinking, but I know I will be running again soon. Maybe I need a special treat, like a new iPod to bring me into play again. I just know I'm not through. I will be running a 5K on May 5th at the very least. I may try for an exotic half-marathon somewhere in California. I just need to rearrange a few things and soon I'll be laced up and on the run again.</p>

<p>If you have ever experienced something similar, please offer up some pointers. I'd love to get myself out of this post-run depression and get back on the road.</p>

<p>So that's that. More on some of the other stuff later. Right now I'm going to enjoy the rest of my evening and listen to some tunes. Later.</p>

I was born in Ohio, grew up in Florida, spent 10 years living in Georgia, 3 months in Ohio and now I live in California. I enjoy running, film, Web design, reading and working out. I like to blog about politics, news, film, life in California and whatever bizarre things that are happening in my life.</div>
