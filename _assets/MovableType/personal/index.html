                              <p>I am happily settled in Columbia, Mo., and my move couldn't have gone better. My car, which has driven all across California several times as well as all the way from Ohio, arrived safe in sound in the same state from which I embarked nearly three years ago. The move was kind of hectic but after some TLC, my new apartment is positively fabulous. I'm getting oriented and trying to find my footing here academically and professionally, but for the most part things are going well. I should be really excited, but to be honest, I feel so subdued. It's just me, after all. I'm just waiting for the fun to begin.</p>

<center><img alt="coming.png" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/coming.png" width="551" height="168" /></center>

<p>One thing I've been working on for several weeks is a new blog. I'm moving from MovableType to WordPress and I'm launching this week. I plan on bloggin a lot more (I know, you've heard that before), but this time I mean it. I have more time, I think, and I am anxious to sharpen my blogging prowess. I want to become a more respected voice on politics, news, film and all the crazy junk I write about. And I want to grow in a lot of other different ways too. We'll see, I guess.</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for reading and hopefully you'll be reading more and more! Expect some downtime, but in no time everything will be up at nicksblog.net.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

                     <a id="a000120"></a>
                     <div class="entry" id="entry-120">
                        <h3 class="entry-header">Leaving Las Visalia</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p>Three years ago, I began a new chapter in my life when my college experience ended. On Aug. 1, 2005, I left Athens, Ga., to live with my mother in Ohio. It was a difficult change to make but it eventually led me to my new home, Visalia, Calif., where I began my career as a journalist, serving as copy editor at the Visalia Times-Delta newspaper. After over a year of work on the copy desk, I began to show an interest in multimedia, prompting my editors to create for me the position of multimedia reporter — a position which afforded me the opportunity to produce video content for our newspaper's Web site. I have been in that position for over a year now, leading me to my next big change. It's August 1 again and I'm going home — again.</p>

<p>It's kind of a rush, to say the least. I find it rather ironic that this point of the year beckons me back to Ohio. Though it is true that I am moving to Columbia, Mo., to attend graduate school at the University of Missouri-Columbia, I am traveling to Ohio to pick up my mother, who will help me move into my apartment in Columbia. The journey begins at 5 p.m. August 1, when my employment with Gannett ends. I will drive to Las Vegas to see my college friends Padmini and Braniff. I will spend Saturday with them before embarking early Sunday morning for however far I can drive down Interstate 70 in one day. On Monday I assume I'll be in Kansas, on my way to Ohio. I'll drive past Columbia and into St. Louis, where I will pick up my sister. Together we will go to Brookville, Ohio, where we will rest and wait for my mother to finish her night shift at the hospital. Tuesday afternoon, the three of us will head back to Columbia, get a hotel room and rest before moving the things I packed this past weekend into my new apartment.</p>

<p>So, yeah, that's the plan. It's really ending. My time in California has come to an end. More experiences in this wonderful state are to come, I am certain, but this detour is necessary. Graduate school, the next chapter in my life, will afford me many opportunities that Gannett and the Times-Delta will not. I will have the opportunity to develop my new media skills beyond the editing prowess and content management understanding I've mastered at the Times-Delta. My dedication to coding and Web design will be re-invested and invigorated — at least I hope. I aim to be finishing up an internship at a major media or new media corporation or Web site by this time next year. I will be cultivating the connections necessary to acheive the career goals I have set for myself in the next 5 years. Hopefully, by the end of that time, I will have re-located to my dream location — Washington D.C. — covering politics and employing my skills for a company that values my skills, intelligence and experience.</p>

<p>That's the dream. And it all starts today, August 1. I have been waiting for this day long before I knew it would come this day, this time, this year. I always knew I would be leaving the Times-Delta. I knew that the Central Valley was not the place for me. I love the mountains, I love the Sierra. I will miss Yosemite. I will miss the Central Coast. Los Angeles will alas quake without me. And I will continue to curse San Francisco, who not only litters my car window with parking tickets but exceeds in thwarting my flirtations with alternative transportation (translation: My bike was stolen last month on Market Street in San Francisco). But all of this is not enough to make me stay. I must move on. Finishing graduate school is something I have known I must do. Now the time has come.</p>

<p>As for my blog, big changes are coming. More on that when I make it a little further from California.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading. See you on the other side.</p>

                              <p><img alt="lastinu.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/lastinu.jpg" width="300" height="900" class="insetright" align="right" />Our lives are full of different distractions that bring us joy. I have been lucky to stumble on a few, many of which continue to distract and amuse. I enjoy listening to the band garbage, though they remain in what seems like an endless hiatus. I have seven seasons of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" to watch here at home, though a new comic book series named "Season 8" has continued this obsession for me. But, for the last six years, I have enjoyed a different kind of pop culture delight: Inuyasha.</p>

<p>It started for me as a late night excuse to avoid homework. I was still a college student at the University of Georgia and like many of my peers I would stay up late watching Cartoon Network's Adult Swim. At 12:30 a.m. every night, Inuyasha would come on, and as much as I resisted, I soon became sucked into the story. The anime cartoon chronicled the adventures of Kagome, a middle school student in Tokyo who stumbles upon the entryway to a door to the past — the feudal era of Japan, 500 years in the past to be exact. There she resurrects a half demon, Inuyasha, and together they go on a "collect the pieces" quest, which is an often repeated story gimmick in Japanese manga.</p>

<p>Well, it's been over 11 years and about two years since I picked up on the continuation of the manga version of Inuyasha, which is the ongoing storyline that the anime was adapted from. The past nine weeks have brought us the final volume of Inuyasha, where Naraku is finally killed and the Shikon Jewel is dealt with once and for all. It's sad to see the series end, but it's so refreshing that such a long standing story can be given such an appropriate send off.</p>

<p>Basically, if you're looking to be spoiled, Inuyasha and Kagome wish away the Shikon Jewel only to be separated by time again. As Kaede says, Kagome appeared with the Shikon Jewel and she disappeared with it as well. Three years pass and Kagome graduates high school, considering her future. She realizes why she has been unable to reach Inuyasha across time and makes the difficult decision in her heart to give up her live in the modern era and live permanently in feudal Japan.</p>

<p>The manga ends there, with epilogues revealing that Sango and Miroku marry and have three kids, Kohaku beginning to develop into a powerful demon slayer and Shippou training to become a powerful fox demon. The cutest part of the final chapter would have to be Kagome's heartfelt exchange with Inuyasha's older brother Sesshomaru, where she calls him brother-in-law. This is the perhaps the chapter's only clear implication that Kagome and Inuyasha have indeed decided to live on together romantically (though there other obvious implications that lead to this assumption). We're not given a kiss between the two, but their characters are allowed to drift happily into the sunset.</p>

<p>It might not be my chosen ending, but I'll take it. I always hoped that Naraku, the series antagonist, would live on forever coveting the Shikon Jewel. Kikyo, Inuyasha's resurrected ex-girlfriend, would curse him and drag him willingly to hell, the only place they could ever be together. Shattered and destroyed, Kagome would return to her time broken hearted, but forever remembering Inuyasha and regretting her sad fate. Thankfully for the fangirls and boys, that didn't happen.</p>

<p>I actually have a couple poems I wrote about the series Inuyasha, which I hope sometime I will bring to the surface of this incarnation of my Web site. For now, I've finally begun work on what may be my final poem about the anime/manga series, chronicling Kikyo's perspective of my vision of the fates of the series protagonists. I may save that for this blog or perhaps for my next blog's introduction. Who knows, we'll see.</p>

<p>Anyways, that's my sendoff for Inuyasha. It was a fabulous series and I will miss looking forward to a new and exciting chapter every week. Now what am I going to do!</p>

<p>Today there was a bombshell: Naraku, the villainous antagonist in the Inuyasha manga, has been annihilated! With one shot of Kagome's arrow, he's been finished.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, I think it was a few months ago that I announced the untimely death of Kohaku, the one-time protector of the final Shikon jewel shard. Well, it turns out the little bastard survived (some loophole involving a dead miko's enduring light).</p>

<p>Well, Naraku is definitely dead, right? Well, that's hard to say. The coolest thing about Naraku's death is it appears he's taking Kagome with him. A few issues back, Naraku's last remaining detachment, Byakuya of the Mirage, used his mysterious blade to cut Kagome. It had recently absorbed Inuyasha's Meidou attack, which dispatches an enemy straight to hell. Mysteriously, Byakuya's attack didn't do anything. For the past three issues, everyone has been waiting anxiously to see what wound he had inflicted.</p>

<p>As Naraku fought desperately against the combined force of the Inutachi and Sesshomaru, he finally faced the purity of Kagome's arrow, allowing his body and the jewel to at last be purified. Earlier in the battle, Kagome mused about the true purpose of Naraku's quest to gather the jewel shards. What wish did he want the jewel the grant? The woman he truly wanted, Kikyo, was dead, so that wish was not granted.</p>

<p>As Naraku hovered above the well through which Kagome magically appeared, returning the jewel to the feudal era, he conceded that his true wish could not be granted, so he made another. His wish would be granted the moment his life was extinguished. As it turns out, Byakuya's strike was integral to this wish: With Naraku dead, a path to hell opens behind Kagome.</p>

<p>OMG, how cool is this manga? This is freakin' Hades and Persephone! What is going to happen next?!</p>

<p>I'll be sure to tell. The manga is on the verge of ending, possibly in the next two months! Sadness :'(</p>

<p>Well, for once, I'm actually doing something this Christmas. After two years of night shifts on the copy desk, I'm spending a week with my family in Ohio. It's pretty fabulous, but it took a hell of a lot of aggravation and stress to get where I am this Christmas Night. As I imparted just yesterday to a friend...</p>

<blockquote>I left in time for my flight, but not before an absolutely hellish experience. For one, I must have hit something in the road with my car in the hours before I left for the airport because my fender has been bent which has made opening the driver's side door an excruciating experience. I have no idea how this happened, and since I had to leave at 2 a.m. Sunday morning for the Los Angeles airport, I had no time to deal with it.

<p>Then the cat got out an hour before I had to leave. I had to wake up my roommate to help me look for him and leave slightly late before he showed up shivering at the door. (Oh, and I had to double back to get my "Showgirls" DVD, which I will be watching with my mother over the holiday).</p>

<p>And on top of all this, the scary movie fog emerged in Tulare County at 7 p.m. Saturday night, making my drive down Highway 99 an absolutely horrific experience. I survived, made my flight, but sadly my Sunday was consumed by 20-minute naps and a flight experience akin to the sensations a small animal must feel being trapped in a cage.</p>

<p>But, after a harrowing week of breaking news related to the Tulare County Sheriff's detective's death and funeral (including 11- and 13-hour days on Thursday and Friday), this object is finally at rest.</blockquote></p>

<p>These special days, as I mount many ambitious plans for my future, I am noticing it's harder and harder to hold on to my hard-earned cash. One of the reaons this is so is directly related to the little nuissance that wandered into my apartment a few months ago: Sue.</p>

<p>Yes I have a cat now. He is a little bastard but I love him. Natalie and I were having a few drinks, toasting her recent ascension in the newspaper world, when she heard what she described as two cats fighting. I went downstairs to investigate and out of the bushes romped out the source to all my financial woe. He was an emaciated little feline and Natalie was happy to share some kibble (our first mistake). Ever since, he has not left my apartment (except of course for that wonderful day we had his little balls chopped off).</p>

<p>I have to say, after a few months, I am really taking a liking to this cat. He really does love me a bunch (he's curled up next to me as I write this entry). As much as I wished he would have just moved on those first few days, it's kind of nice to have a pet at last. I always knew that if I was going to get a cat, the cat would have to find me.</p>

<p>As for why we named it Sue, only Natalie and I know the true story. But as you can guess, it has a little something to do with a little diddy by Johnny Cash. Let me know what you think of my boy named Sue!</p>

<p>To follow up my Google-favorite entry, titled <a href="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/2006/07/kikyos_dead.html">"Kikyo's dead!"</a>, I have to announce the passing of another hallmark Inuyasha character: Kohaku.</p>

<p>If anyone has been keeping up with the goings on of the Inuyasha manga, you have got to be stoked. So many plot points are becoming neatly tied into little knots all up and down feudal Japan. To name a few, Inuyasha has finally bested Sesshomaru as far as the disputed Tessaiga and Sesshomaru himself has resurrected his long-missing left arm and in its grip was his own daiyokai sword, Bakusaiga. Kagome has delved into her spiritual self to reveal why she has always been such a pussy — the reason being because the dark force in the Shikon jewel named Magatsuhi has sealed her spiritual powers. And the loving duo of Sango and Miroku have risked their lives to sustain their only weapons against Naraku, Sango strengthening her Hiraikotsu and Miroku dangerously pushing his body to its utmost limit, with a line of shoki inching closer and closer to his heart.</p>

<p>Needless to say, our heroes have been very busy. And in the most recent installment, Chapter 528, Kohaku, damned brother to Sango who was revived by a shard of the Shikon jewel, overcomes his many sins and grabs hold of his false life, vowing to defeat Naraku and purify the jewel once and for all. After freeing Kagome, who had characteristically been captured by Naraku, Kohaku stands triumphant, vowing from now on, he would live his live like it were his own.</p>

<p>It is in that moment that a discarded piece of Naraku's flesh, like a magic bullet, shoots into Kohaku's back and out his neck, CAPTURING THE SHIKON JEWEL SHARD AND KILLING HIM! This is humongous news for Inuyasha fans! With Kohaku's death and a lily piece of Naraku flesh darting up to momma Naraku with a jewel shard surprise, that can only mean the manga's end is nigh!</p>

<p>I get a lot of comments asking where to go to see Inuyasha scanlations. Well, click <a href="http://freelance.110mb.com/">here</a> and <a href="http://adinuyasha.thebrokenconsole.com/">here</a>. They are great!</p>

<p>More to come, I promise!</p>

<center><img alt="halfdome.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/halfdome.jpg" width="558" height="418" /></center>

<p>Natalie and I went hiking up Half Dome last weekend. It was part of my super weekend in Yosemite. It all began on Friday evening after Braniff and Padmini came to visit for the weekend for National Parks adventures. We went up to Yosemite and found a nice campsite and roasted up some soy dogs and soysauge and rode the weekend along as it drifted away, like the pristine constellations that wafted in and out of the endless sky. I haven't been anyplace like Yosemite Valley in the two years I've lived here, it was amazing. It was a microcosm of everything that the Sierra has to offer.</p>

<p><img alt="nicknathike.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/nicknathike.jpg" width="350" height="282" align="left" class="insetleft" />On Sunday, Natalie came up for our big finale. I might not have mentioned, but Natalie was awarded a fellowship with the Metcalf Institute, so she is moving to Rhode Island this week to begin her studies and her eventual placement at the Providence Journal. It's a real bummer, she's been my best friend for a year now here, and I'm really going to miss her. Since we have been talking about tackling Half Dome since October of last year, we had to take the trip while we could.</p>

<p>This hike was unlike anything I have experienced so far. For one, instead of tackling a 16-mile hike in a day (much like my 22-mile hike up Mt. Whitney, which took 16 hours), we decided to split it up over two days, camping at Little Yosemite Valley, which is about half way to the summit. Because of this, I had to rent a large pack so I could carry the food, sleeping bag and tent for us. It was very rough to say the least.</p>

<p>On the way to Little Yosemite, we took the Mist Trail, which brings you up close to Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls, some spectacular sights. Unfortunately, though the trail is relatively short, the elevation gain is brutal, so I tired very easily carrying my large pack around. I was dying to get to Little Yosemite, where, once I arrived, I quickly assembled the tent and laid back on my new sleeping bag for a snooze.</p>

<p>That evening, Natalie and I shared our food with fellow campers and scored some tasty potatoes and a shot or two of tequila. In the morning, though we started out two hours after we had intended, I was slow to keep up with Natalie, who was on a rampage like always. We started at 7:30 and reached the cables by 9.</p>

<p><img alt="thecables.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/thecables.jpg" width="300" height="881" align="right" class="insetright" />The cables are something else. Sure, they are the most dangerous part of the Half Dome hike, but Natalie and I agreed the section from "the step" to just before the cables was pretty scary. Bascially, after climbing all these steps and making it to at least the point that you can begin to see the end, you have to scale these semi-steep granite slabs without any indication of direction. Natalie and I mistakenly opted for a course on the right, which was very grainy, where one slip would have us sliding down the mountain. Luckily, we were alright.</p>

<p>You absolutely need gloves on the cables. If I didn't have them, I would be toast. As long as you have a firm grip on the cables and are able to pull yourself steadily up the very steep granite dome, you can do just fine. My biggest annoyance was Natalie's stop-and-go pace up the dome. I would be right behind her and she'd swat me away from her wooden plank. But if I waited, she'd be five or six planks above me and I'd have to scale the cables by myself without anyone nearby to help.</p>

<p>The view was spectacular. The best thing about the trip was on Saturday, when I was with Padmini and Braniff, I looked out into Yosemite Valley from the Tunnel View. By Monday, I was looking out toward the same tunnel from the very top of the Valley. You can't beat it.</p>

<p>The hike down was dramatic, to say the least. Natalie and I pulled it together, though. It was a great weekend, but by the end of it I was getting sick of all that fresh air and dirt under my fingernails. But I still can't complain too much — though it can be a real drag, living in the Central Valley, so close to the Sierra, certainly has its perks.</p>

<p>So Natalie moved out on Sunday. If you aren't clear on who she is, I mentioned her <a href="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/2006/12/drunk_chick_at_a_party.html">here</a>. She's basically the reason that I stopped writing in my blog so often. She's my best friend in California and it hasn't quite sunk in how much I'm going to miss her. Thankfully, I replaced here (roommate wise), so I don't have to focus on the negative aspects of her move (that being the negative effect it's going to have on my financially). I'm really happy for her, but already I'm felling that vivacious and adventurous spirit she inspired within me deaden.</p>

<p>But that won't last. Even though people in my life drift in and out, I like to think that I take of piece of them with me. Though I won't get to see Natalie every day and rampage across the state with her (Los Angeles, Sequoia National Park, Fresno, Santa Cruz, Sacramento and Half Dome to name a few), I can already feel that little piece of Natalie within me finding its place. I have my reusable shopping bag ready to go and florescent light bulbs are all over my shopping list. Oh, and I cleaned the kitchen today...but that habit won't last. I guess I'll always be me.</p>

<p>My computer is on the fritz again so I will be back, new and improved...well, all over again. So woopie! If you've been wondering what I've been up to, go to the <a href="http://www.VisaliaTimesDelta.com/Video">Times-Delta video page</a> and you're sure to see I've been busy.</p>

                              <p>An interesting thing came up in the debate between Republican candidates for President Tuesday night: blowback.</p>

<p>I found something very interesting in the film I watched the other day on that very subject. I wish I could express myself more clearly tonight, but this is something that I think is very important and it's something that I have always suspected since the very first few days after 9/11. Chalmers Johnson, a CIA expert, had some very interesting things to say about "blowback" in the documentary <em>Why We Fight</em> (which have been conveniently posted on <a href="http://www.collectedthoughts.com/blog.aspx?id=11462">this blog</a> for you to see for yourself):</p>

<blockquote><img alt="chalmers.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/chalmers.jpg" width="200" height="302" align="right" class="insetright" />There is a direct connection between events that happened more than 50 years ago and the War in Iraq today. In 1953, the prime minister of Iran, Mohammed Mossadeq became extremely irritated the British were ripping off his country's national resources, he wanted a greater share in it. The British came to the new president, Eisenhower, and asked for help on this. Eisenhower very conveniently declared Mossadeq to be communist and we then set the CIA to overthrow him. 

<p>The result was we brought the shah to power and he created an extremely repressive regime that within 20 years had led to a revolution against him. The Ayatollah Khomeini creates a government that is violently anti-American.</p>

<p>In the after-action report by the CIA on what they had done in Iran in 1953, they said "we're going to get some 'blowback' from this."</p>

<p>We then made a puppet out of Saddam Hussein in Iraq, who was a friend of ours. He was an asset in the CIA's computers. We did so because he was anti-Iranian. He was very fearful that the revolution in Iran would spread into his county. He therefore went to war with Iran. The war was extremely bloody, went on throughout the 1980's. Unfortunatly for Saddamm Hussein, he began to lose the war.</p>

<p>At that point, in comes the United States in the form of Donald Rumsfled sent to Saddam Hussein by President Reagan to tell him, "We will provide you with intelligence, we will supply you with the weapons you may need thorough covert means." It is why cynics in Washington say "We know Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. We have the receipts."</p>

<p>This is what we mean by blowback. He remained a friend of ours right up to his invasion in the summer of 1990 of Kuwait. We became alarmed when he invaded Kuwait that he could also go on and invade Saudi Arabia itself, the largest reserves of oil on Earth. We stationed troops in Saudi Arabia. It was a mistake in every sense of the term.</p>

<p>Remember, Osama bin Laden had said, "I resent the government of Saudi Arabia for using Americans to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraq." At that point we began to fear we were going to lose our position in Saudi Arabia. Well the second largest source of proven reserves on earth are in Iraq. This leads us now to demonize our previous ally and to prepare the American public for the thought that we must take him out.</blockquote></p>

<p>Presidential candidate and Texas Representative Ron Paul brought up the issue of "blowback"  in the debate last night and has since been blasted by conservatives for daring to suggest 9/11 was in any way our fault. I believe he handled himself very well in harsh light day on Hannity and Colmes last night (hat tip to <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/05/16/ron-paul-schools-hannity-on-blowback/">Crooks and Liars</a>).</p>

<p>I never understood why it was so outrageous to think that the terrorists who attacked us on that horrible day had some defensible vendetta against the United States. I for one do not believe we should lump "terrorists" into convenient categories such as "evil-doers." I certainly don't think they have a legitimate excuse to attack Americans, I'm just saying their reasons, given their unique, individual experiences with U.S. foreign policy seem to explain why a certain group of people in this world hate us.</p>

<p>They don't hate us because women can vote. They don't despise us because we have the right to speak freely. They have simply experienced the day-to-day hell that has been inflicted, either directly or indirectly, by our government's actions in the world. Look at what happens in Iraq day in and day out and tell me you can't understand why someone would take arms against our country (or dare to attack us on our own soil). Again, not to say I defend their reasons...I simply acknowledge that they have a position.</p>

<p>I think what Ron Paul said last night at the debate is what Americans need to hear in this national contest: honest, frank conversation that seeks to uncover the root of the problems that our forces are facing today. Maybe if we considered things like "blowback" when we decide to unilaterally impose our will on another country, things like 9/11 would not happen. <em>Again, wrongs made by elements of the military-industrial complex and not everyday Americans who somehow invited tragedy on that fateful day</em>.</p>

<p>I find this incredibly entralling and it would be even more interesting to see more of this in our national debate.</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/obituaries/16falwell.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin">Jerry Falwell, Moral Majority Founder, Dies at 73</a><br>
By Peter Applebome<br>
<b>New York Times</b>

<p><img alt="falwell.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/falwell.jpg" width="298" height="340" align="right" class="insetright" />The Rev. Jerry Falwell, the fundamentalist preacher who founded the Moral Majority and brought the language and passions of religious conservatives into the hurly-burly of American politics, died yesterday in Lynchburg, Va. He was 73.</p>

<p>His death was announced by Liberty University, in Lynchburg, where Mr. Falwell, its founder, was chancellor. The university said the cause had not been determined, adding that he died in a hospital after being found unconscious in his university office yesterday morning.</p>

<p>Mr. Falwell went from a Baptist preacher in Lynchburg to a powerful force in electoral politics, at home in both the millennial world of fundamentalist Christianity and the earthly blood sport of the political arena.</p>

<p>As much as anyone, he helped create the religious right as a political force, defined the issues that would energize it for decades and cemented its ties to the Republican Party.</blockquote></p>

<p>Am I sad that Jerry Falwell is dead and gone? Hell no. He was a hateful, narrow-minded man who empowered a generation of hateful, ignorant, like-minded bigots to rise up against innocent people they disdain and refuse to accept. Would you honor the life of a racist man if you were black and witnessed first-hand the effects of polarizing hate perpetuated by that one man?</p>

<p>I find it insulting to read <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2007/05/15/breaking-jerry-falwell-in-gravely-serious-condition-after-being-found-unconscious/">certain red blogs</a> that are playing "gotcha!" with other left-leaning sites for taking a shots at the holy man. If my prayers would be for anyone, it would be for the man's family and loved ones. They are the ones who deserve mercy, but not that hateful man, one who spoke these shocking words after one of our country's most tragic events:</p>

<blockquote>I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America. I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.' ~ Jerry Falwell, September 11, 2001</blockquote>

<p>In the coming years, that man will be remembered more for his hateful, polarizing rhetoric against gays and lesbians than for his upholding of the faithful tenets of Jesus Christ. Anyone who hesitates in this fact will grow to regret it in the coming years and decades. This man is a dinosaur and the world is better now that he has passed.</p>

<p>New Order, one of the most enigmatic and inventive bands of the last 30 years, have finally called it quits. The band formed from the band Joy Division after the suicide of Ian Curtis. They have produced hits such as "Blue Monday," "True Faith," "Crystal," "Age of Consent" and "Bizarre Love Triangle," by far my favorite. Bassist Peter Hook announced the band's split on his MySpace blog on Wednesday:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=180575671&blogID=262679181&MyToken=c77a2624-ef19-44e9-8db5-ce4cc439be11">life goes on!</a><br>
<a href="http://myspace.com/180575671">http://myspace.com/180575671</a>

<p>well here we go again another action packed week.</p>

<p>i suppose it was the interview with clint boon that started it all off hed asked me for a few words on perry farrells satellite party single dogstar [which he thought was great] so i went on and lo and behold mentioned the N>O> split so i suppose because it was me sayin it it was out at last. im relieved really hated carryin on as normal with an awful secret so lets move on shall we?</blockquote></p>

<p>It was as recently as Friday night that I was driving with Natalie rocking out to "Age of Consent" on the lonely drive back from Fresno. I've even turned her on to the band, burning her a copy of <em>Power, Corruption & Lies</em>, the bands seminal 1983 album that beget "Blue Monday," which still influences artists in the realm of Trance and House music.</p>

<p>New Order is part of my own personal trifecta of musical groups that I'm always citing: garbage, New Order and The Cure. Garbage announced Friday that their long-expected greatest hits album <em>Absolute Garbage</em> would be hitting stores soon and The Cure have been riding rumors of a new album since the whole of 2006. I had heard New Order was keen on releasing a new album from their <em>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</em> recording session, but now that is a big question.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time New Order has ducked from the music scene. Between the release of <em>Republic</em> and the recording of <em>Get Ready</em> in 1993 and 1998 respectively, New Order seemed a lost relic of the '80s. Hopefully they can demonstrate the resilience and fortitude to reunite and forge another album to close out the decade, or at least bring us into the next. They are talented and timeless musicians and I am very sorry I may never have the opportunity to see them play again.</p>

<p>For now, I'll leave you with the video for "Krafty," from the <em>Waiting for the Sirens' Call</em> album, which helped to rescue me from a endless, consuming depression.</p>

<p>There's no reason why I shouldn't have written this a month ago but I have just been on a break. 26.2 miles takes a lot out of you, and so does working 50 plus hours a week. Things are finally slowing down now and a lot of interesting changes are coming down the pipe. Before I go into all that, it's important that I at least address my major accomplishment, at least once before it fades into obscurity.</p>

<p>It was Sunday, March 25, and I woke up at my sister's friend Tyler's apartment feeling just a tiny bit uneasy about the race. I had spent the three weeks prior taking it real easy. After finishing a grueling training schedule, I had hoped to keep up the pace in the weeks closing in on the big day, but pain in my leg had forced me to rein in my ambitious plans. I woke up that morning thinking that maybe I had eroded a lot of the ground I had worked so hard to gain footing upon. Part of that was true.</p>

<p>Regardless, I could only race with the body I had and not the body I wish I could have had. My leg was thankfully not bothersome on race day and I made my way down to the MARTA station in Midtown Atlanta at the fine hour of 5:30 in the morning. The race was an hour and a half away.</p>

<p>I arrived at 6 a.m. and called Marilia. She had it real rough, a lot worse than me. I'd done this before. A marathon for me would be 26.2 miles of deja vu. Sure, it was going to be rough, but at least I knew I had once stood (barely) at the finish line. For Marilia, finding the finish was not a done deal. Also, catching the train on time was also missing from the cards — she arrived 10 minutes before the race. I tossed her her things, gave her a Tylenol 8-Hour, a kiss and I told her I loved her and good luck. It was her race and I couldn't run it for her. Besides, I had a race to run myself.</p>

<p><img alt="marathon2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathon2.jpg" width="256" height="384" align="right" class="insetright" />It wasn't until the mass of people started to finally eek its way to the start line that it finally hit me: I was really running this. I got a chill down my spine and I felt something I didn't expect I'd feel in the warm familiarity of the brisk Atlanta morning: I was in this all by myself. Sure, Marilia was probably a half-mile behind me there, but just like the first race, I ran this one alone. The track was familiar. My sister was a text message away, but I was still in this for myself. I somehow thought that running on the streets of Atlanta would be like seeing every neighbor and friend cheering me on, that somehow an envelope of everything I remember from my years in Georgia would whisk me joyfully to the finish line in a rush of joy and triumph. It wasn't like that at all. I had to run every single one of those miles and all the city really afforded me the comfort of was a few moments along the lines of, "Oh, Decatur...I've been there."</p>

<p>Well, I didn't have a cheering section, granted, but I didn't have one in Yokohl Valley either and I had some of my best runs out there. I could do this. The early race went very well. I kept up a very great pace and walked through many water stations for maybe 45 seconds or less. The only major train wreck came from the race itself — no Powerade! It was promised but the race barely delivered. At best we'd get a heavily watered down sprinkling of Powerade powder and at worse we got no water at all! Between mile 3 and mile 8, there was no water at all! And the worst part of it all was the signs promising water that didn't actually deliver until 3 miles later! It was awful, but it was a real boon for me. I never walked substantially until the half. I was in prime form.</p>

<p>Sadly, the hills of Decatur hit my pride hard and I began to conserve my energies. Conserving began to weaken my resolve and I started to scale back my goal from 4:30 to 4:45 and 4:50 (4:59?). I walked a lot toward the end and I only have myself to blame. Besides that, water stations were never reliable and Powerade was absolutely no where to be found in the second half of the race. I had relied very much on Gatorade in my training so I'm almost certain that had an effect on my energy. How much, I'm not certain, but I still tried to stick it through.</p>

<p><img alt="marathon3.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathon3.jpg" width="255" height="384" align="right" align="insetright" />In the end, I finished the race in 5 hours and 4 minutes — a full 15 minutes faster than I did in San Diego almost one year ago. It was a fabulous end to a marathon effort. I am very pleased with my finish and I only hope to roll back my time 15 or 30 minutes more in my next race. My goal is to surmount a marathon again before the end of the year. I have my eyes on the Sacramento race in December but I may also try for a summer race along with a quicker training schedule.</p>

<p>Also, I am considering rearranging any future marathon training schedule. Distance is no longer taboo for me. Fourteen miles is a drop in the bucket, and 18 to 20 is also very doable, even now after slumming it for almost a month. I would like to start running longer distances and working on speed in my future training. I know I can make 4:30, I just need to chip away at it more and more.</p>

<p>For now, I'm taking a serious break. My leg pain really worried me and I think I've been overdoing it so long. I think I may have slipped into a postrun depression too, which is kind of unsettling. An almost, "What's the point?" feeling has settled over me. I run so much, it's like there is no end. The race was the end, in this sense, so what next? I'm still thinking, but I know I will be running again soon. Maybe I need a special treat, like a new iPod to bring me into play again. I just know I'm not through. I will be running a 5K on May 5th at the very least. I may try for an exotic half-marathon somewhere in California. I just need to rearrange a few things and soon I'll be laced up and on the run again.</p>

<p>If you have ever experienced something similar, please offer up some pointers. I'd love to get myself out of this post-run depression and get back on the road.</p>

<p>So that's that. More on some of the other stuff later. Right now I'm going to enjoy the rest of my evening and listen to some tunes. Later.</p>

I felt like Nomi Malone walking into Ver-sayce for the very first time: My first trip to Vegas since my "Showgirls" awakening. This weekend I went to see my good friends Padmini and Braniff, who moved to Las Vegas last year after graduating UGA.</p>

<p>It's quite extraordinary. I only have Jeremy to blame. Ever since that DVD took a spin, I have been devoted to the crazy film that is a considered a camp classic as opposed to the abysmal film most people remember. There are many memorable scenes, but none as outrageous as the Spago scene. Shortly after I disembarked from McCarran, Padmini and I ventured to the hallowed film landmark that is the Forum at Caesar's Palace. There I was on cloud 9.</p>

<p>The highlight of the trip would be asking the waiter at the ritzy Spago retaurant for chips, even though they were not on the menu. When they were brought to the table, I couldn't help but relive that awesome scene...</p>

<blockquote><strong>Crystal:</strong> Do you like brown rice and vegetables?<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> Yeah.<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> You do?<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> Sort of...<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> Really?<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> Worse than dog food. It is!<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> I've had dog food.<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> You have?<br>
<strong>Crystal:</strong> Long time ago. Doggie Chow.  I used to love Doggie Chow.<br>
<strong>Nomi:</strong> I used to love Doggie Chow too!<br>
<em>[As if the wall that had once separated them had been felled by wave of Doggie Chow, Crystal raises the chip in her hand and Nomi touches her chip to it and they toast chips.]</em></blockquote>

<p><img alt="vegas2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/vegas2.jpg" width="300" height="318" align="left" class="insetleft" />It was like everything I dreamed it would be. Afterward we went to the Ver-sayce and I couldn't help but notice that the photo I took resembled a doorway to heaven, likely the same image that came to Nomi's mind when she first laid her eyes on the establishment. If only the sight of expensive dresses could bring me to the heights it brought her, but I will be just fine living vicariously through the acting of Elizabeth Berkely.</p>

<p>Well, now that I've gotten over the Showgirls-related goodness (we took a photo outside of the Cheetah too!), I can talk about how wonderful my trip was as a whole. Padmini was so wonderful and I had such a great time going around with her and Braniff. Never have I seen such a complete picture of Las Vegas. Oh so often, tourists are relegated to the two or three miles they decided to walk along the Strip. There's so much more to Vegas than that. There's the renowned Thai restaurant we went to on Friday evening. There's the delicious vegetarian Chinese restaurant Braniff and Padmini took me to before we went to "Mamma Mia." And then there's Red Rock Canyon, a beautiful natural landscape that not even California can claim.</p>

<p>We also enjoyed many things on the Strip. I got to see the aquarium conservatory at Mandalay Bay. There was the fountain at the Bellagio that played "All The Jazz" from "Chicago." And the premium outlet where I spent too much money. It was truly the vacation that I never expected. I would have been perfectly happy with chilling at the apartment with Turtle (the cat) watching a movie with friends.</p>

<p>So that was my vacation to Vegas. It was wonderful and I can't wait to go back again (I hear there's a marathon in December). And I really can't wait for Padmini and Braniff to come visit me. There's nothing like sharing the Sierra with friends.</p>

<p>And I swear, marathon entry this week!</p>

<p>P.S.: Video bonus, Padmini's sister's commercial for Swami Pretti Dance Studios. Fabulous! All it's missing is a star wipe, but the bubble wipe almost just as good!</p>

I know I haven't chimed in with an update really since I started my whole post-20-mile slow down. There really hasn't been much to report besides this nagging pain in my leg that I'm praying isn't as bad as I fear it could be. I took things really easy on myself for the past two weeks. I feel very lazy though, I am kind of itching for a good run. It would have been nice to get a few more training runs in, but I want to be 100% on Sunday.</p>

<p>I'm on the plane writing this now, actually, and there is a woman sitting on my row who has taken on the same goal that I have been considering: running a marathon in all 50 states. It's an incredible goal, and when I mentioned it in my typical blabbering manner to the man who sold me the shoes I'm going to wear in the race on Sunday, he laughed out loud. "Who would want to do that??"</p>

<p>I need to keep the long runs up though. I must admit I really enjoy my Saturday runs. Though I'd much rather get sleep, There is something so calming about lacing up at 6 a.m. and trotting down Yokohl Drive alone. It's breathtaking and I always come home feeling incredible. Regardless of what happens Sunday, how can I not do this again? Why wouldn't I want to committ my adult athletic life to something spectacular that only a very select few could ever hope to accomplish. It's these goals that keep me going, these personal feats that provide me with great personal pride.</p>

<p>But that's the day after the day after tomorrow, isn't it? Shouldn't I be more concerned over the fact that my friends have noticed a slight limp in my step the past two weeks? Shouldn't I be wary of all those extended breaks I took at every water stop in Yokohl Valley? Is there anything more I can do?</p>

<p>The race Sunday will be great. I'm expecting, in light of my sometimes sluggish sum pace on my training days, I will finish between 4:40 and 5:00. That's commendable, but I want to do better. I still somewhat consider that a lazy marathon (but an improvement on my first).</p>

<p>I think I might surprise myself tomorrow. While I did take the water stops slowly while training for Rock 'n' Roll Marathon last year, I also walked a whole lot more than I did this year. I ran at a brisk pace for the majority of all my runs this time around. I also showed up to an impressive amount of mid-week training runs. I followed the schedule very closely, so I may find that even walking through the water stations on Sunday will still bring me to a 4:45 finish (maybe even 4:30). I'm just trying to be realistic and not get my hopes up.</p>

<p>In concert with running my second marathon and marking a second state off my marathon list (only 48 states left!), I will be visiting Georgia, where many of my dear friends still live. I'm looking forward to this very much and I'm thrilled I will have the opportunity to share this race with the people I care about. I'm especially proud of my friend Marilia, who will be running her first marathon on Sunday. I can't wait to see her sprint across the finish line. I just hope her experience will be as positive as mine has been.</p>

<p>This is a dream come true for me, I've looked forward to this weekend since last summer when I was bemusing crazy thoughts with Marilia on a Sunday evening. It's amazing how far I've gone. I've run over 300 miles since November 20th. I've been so committed to this, I'm so stoked to see it finally come full circle. Please wish me well and thank you so much for your support!</p>

<p>It feels strange to be on the other side of March 3rd. It really wasn't anything more than my 20-mile run, but last year that meant so much to me.</p>

<p>When I took on the 20-mile run in preparation for the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon in San Diego, I had never really run more than a few feet over 15 miles. I had taken a serious stab at the 16-mile run when I was visiting in Georgia last May, but it was very half-hearted. It was more a tour-de-force of my former stomping grounds. I ran all the way from downtown Athens to my old apartment and beyond. I walked often and when I returned to my friend Padmini's house, I scoffed at my recently-acquired GPS personal trainer that said I had only run 15 miles (of course now I can testify to the accuracy of that nifty device).</p>

<p>This year, I have made it to the top of the hill at mile 8 on more than one occasion. I have begun to frequent the water stops that I no longer need to set my odometer when I'm driving ahead to place my water stops. Twenty miles, to me, represents no more than two miles more than last week, and that's somewhat disappointing.</p>

<p>I almost think that the 18-mile run was more difficult. It was such a nonstarter. Still having the same problems: too much rest. I'm going to run the remaining training days without stopping for water. I can easily run an 8-mile run without water (I think I'm overly hydrated as it is). The last Saturday run — only 10 miles — I can bring the water-bottle pouch I bought for the last marathon if I need it. I know during the race I won't have the opportunity to sit on a stump and take a breather, so at least any sluggish time won't be as wasteful as standing still for 5 minutes. It's going to be cool...</p>

<p><img alt="marathontable305.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathontable305.jpg" width="300" height="315" class="insetright" align="right" />One thing I did do last week was skip my mid-week runs. I lost a total of 11 miles on my training schedule, but it was totally worth it. At this point in the training last year, I was having shin splints and I was in bad shape. This time around, my legs are aching all the time. Now that I'm through the thick of the training, I just need to keep them warmed up and ready for the big day. There was no point subjecting them to unnecessary strain in advance of the big 20-mile Saturday. I knew I was going to make it, with or without the extra training.</p>

<p>The photo I included this week is the "T." When I was training with Team in Training, I always imagined it stood for that since we parked a few hundred feet from that sign. Now, when I see it rising over the hill, I know the run is almost over. Now that I'm slowing down in anticipation for the actual race, it's sad to think that the training is really coming to an end.</p>

<p>I was gushing about my weekend plans this Friday in the newsroom. I really only had one major thing on the agenda: run 18 miles at Yokohl Valley. This guy who I work with, a real cynical guy, asked me, "Why?" I told him I was training for a marathon. He asked again, "Why?" And I told him it made me feel good. And he asked again, "Why?" I think I blubbered something about accomplishing something incredible, and blah blah. He just brushed me off and told me, "You're crazy."</p>

<p><img alt="marathontable226.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/marathontable226.jpg" width="300" height="315" class="insetright" align="right" />I don't know if he's right about that. I must be crazy to trump a zillion more pleasant things to do with my weekend by insisting I spend nearly 4 hours slaving in the sun trying to beat the clock. I don't know, it seemed to make sense at the time.</p>

<p>Unlike the week before, I've been doing really well this past week. When I laid out that 122 miles on that little .jpg graph last week, it made me feel more inclined to complete my miles for the week. Of course, whenever I complete my plan for the week, I always feel good. Since it's been up and down the past few weeks, I guess I really wanted to feel like I was pulling it together for the big day. That day, of course, is this Saturday.</p>

<p>Last year, when I was training for the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon in San Diego, I never ran the 18-mile training day. I did 16 miles in Athens when I was visiting in Georgia, but that was hardly comparable to what I accomplished this weekend. I remember walking a great deal and I don't think I even completed 16 miles. I was just above 15 when I finished. This past weekend, I kept myself above my goal 10:17 pace with the exception of one mile, which included the most grueling hill of the entire circuit. I let it slide.</p>

<p><img alt="yokohl2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/yokohl2.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="insetleft" align="left" />My only problem at this point is the water breaks. The only way anyone can really finish a marathon for the first time without extensive experience is by breaking it down into small pieces. The way I see it, I'm just running two miles until the next water break. When I get there and am refreshed, I take on another two and possible take a gel to help increase my energy. This has been a real problem on days like Saturday. After hills like the one I just mentioned, I tend to sit on a stump sipping my Gatorade and taking a break. During the marathon, that's not an option.</p>

<p>I will probably break a few times for my 20-mile training day — I have to. It's so long, it's probably impossible for me to take it all in one gulp. I think once I finish this grueling day and throttle back to shorter runs. I may try to scale back my break times. During the marathon, there being no stumps to sit on, I will probably have to get by with an occasional stroll through a water stop or a light jog.</p>

<p>Anyways, I did take pictures as I promised. I may share some more next week. I can't believe how good I looked before taking on the day! It's amazing how much eighteen miles takes out of you.</p>

<p>But, I can honestly say, it was worth it.</p>

I had intended on updating my progress every week as a way to blog about something very interesting to me as well as to coach myself through the training. Sadly, that never materialized, but with just a scant 122 miles left in my trek, better late than never.</p>

<p>Training for a marathon is a very amazing feat. Pulling together all those numbers to come up with 247 miles run since late November is staggering. I had to add up the runs again to be absolutely certain I didn't make a mistake. They really do add up.</p>

<p>When I started training this time around, the marathon itself was cemented firmly in the center of mind. I knew running 4 or 5 miles each training day had a point because it was going to make that first stretch of the marathon that much easier. After a while, though, the marathon drifts in your mind and you begin to take each week for what it is, almost forgetting all these miles amount to something. I'm at the point in my training when that once-sought goal is beginning to rise again.</p>

<p>This Saturday's 16 mile run was not very successful. Granted, I did the run, but I kept thinking during the run that my heart just wasn't in it. I've been working long hours at work with little return. I'm having to accommodate weekly runs by waking up at 3:45 in the morning in order to get them out of the way before I have to go into work. All of this weighs heavy after a while and when you finally get to the one day a week you get off (I was supposed to have the weekend off, but that changed), you realize all you want to do is sleep. I walked a bit of the run because I was just exhausted. I'll make it up next week.</p>

<p>Anyways, back to the larger point: the goal. This past Saturday was the first in a line of the most intense training days I will have before the marathon. The next two runs will be 18 and 20 miles respectively, and they are very important. At mile 8 this past weekend, I sat sipping my Gatorade thinking, "I'm only 2 miles away from 20 miles," meaning only 2 miles from the 10 mile mark, the halfway point for my longest run of the training. I can't wait to get there.</p>

<p>After that point, the marathon itself will begin to crystallize for me. My trip to Atlanta will be a double-edged sword: I get to see my friends and family, but I also have to tackle a 26.2 mile behemoth. I know that by the end of that 20 mile run, I'm going to be ready to comprehend exactly what I need to do to make that goal.</p>

<p>To do better this week, I am going to try to wake up early instead of taking the run later in the afternoon. I think I will have more energy then. Here's hoping! We'll see how it goes...</p>

<p>Next week I'll try and bring my camera to share some sights from Yokohl Valley and maybe even Rocky Hill.</p>

<p>Hooray! I'm not dead yet! But I did need to take a lengthy vacation. My computer had a nice time getting it's brain replaced in Tennessee. I, on the other hand, wallowed on my roommate's computer playing Sextris, watching films like My Own Private Idaho and To Kill A Mockingbird and listening to albums like Nada Surf's Proximity Effect and Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. You have no idea how much blog fodder I've had to give up in the past month. I mean, Anna Nicole Smith died! When will I ever get to blog about something that huge again?</p>

<p>Anyways, I am really sorry I have been so scarce. I had no idea that it would be such a big deal, I actually heard from people saying they were wondering why I had stopped blogging. And it wasn't the usual suspects.</p>

<p>Well, I've come up with a personal goal for the year (or at least the next three months). I am aiming for four updates a week, each on different subjects, and they will go as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monday, marathon/personal blog: I had planned on writing about my progress in training for the Georgia Marathon but that just kind of sputtered right out of the gate. I'm still trying to remember to bring my camera to such exotic locales as Yokohl Valley and Rocky Hill so that I can share the sights and scene of my training experience. Just so you know, I'm progressing very well, and despite skipping this last weekend to accommodate my roommate's birthday rampage, I am certain reaching my goal of a 4:30 marathon is within my reach.</li>

<p><li>Wednesday, movie/music blog: There have been a few films I have seen in the past three months that are certainly worth sharing. If I haven't seen anything good recently, I may reach back for some of those picks or I may begin to feature some of my less favored movie picks. Anyone up for a screening of Gigli (like I would Netflix something like that)? Also, I'd like to blog about some albums I'm listening to, so when appropriate, you'll hear the music.</li></p>

<p><li>Thursday, politics/news blog: Depending on what's going on, I may pick an obscure story of the week to highlight or perhaps follow up on some obscure appropriations bill in the House. Someone's got to protect the Pentagon's right to relegate our liberal, San Francisco-values speaker to her connecting flight in Denver. This is when I'll do it.</li></p>

<p><li>Friday, news/California blog: On this day, I'll feature the story of the week. Odds are, it will probably be local. For this week, I'm inclined to the <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070212/NEWS01/702120323">(non) story</a> of this girl who was missing for a few hours on Sunday that had webgoers at the <a href="http://visaliatimesdelta.com">Visalia Times-Delta Web site</a> on the edge of their seats. Someone has to bring these stories to light because no matter how many Drudge tips I send, I'm dead to him.</li></ul><br />
And hopefully more than that. Sometimes blond women who can hardly be labeled as a model, actress or entertainer die and people like myself feel they have to comment as soon as it happens. Just to quench anyone's thirst of what I might have brought to light in such a hypothetical situation, I imagine I would have composed a sonnet exploring her various "achievements" (Don't believe me? It wouldn't be <a href="http://endlessone.com/thursday/journal/spring04/2-22-04journal.html">the first time</a>).</p>

<p>But I'll start all that tomorrow. For now, I have to reformat my hard drive because despite sending my computer to get a new motherboard because the AC adapter was for some reason charging the battery intermittently, I somehow wound up with a bad hard drive. Wow...and something about a bad CD/DVD-ROM too...what the hell? </p>

<p>A bit of advice: Don't hand your computer to strange postmen. You'll end up regretting it.</p>

<p>Later</p>

<p>I was watching Family Guy last night and I saw something that reminded me so much of my fabulous roommate Natalie. For anyone who doesn't know Natalie, she's this great person I met in California. She's been such a great friend these last few months and we've had a great time tearing it up in Visalia, Fresno and recently Sacramento.</p>

<p>She moved in this last October and, if you read the blog, her entrance corresponds with my sudden drop-off in writing in this silly thing. I mean, two of the entries I have done in the last 24 hours were done in her absense and I was only able to tweak out my President Ford tribute while she was sleeping on the couch.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'm really glad to have a friend like her and I look forward to spending even more time with her next year. We'll be swimming in men next year, I just know it! More on Natalie later if I am able to push out this year-in-review thing I've been throwing around in my head...</p>

                              <p>Another Christmas is over and, sadly, this was the second Christmas I spent alone. I know, doesn't that sound depressing? It's really not. it's kind of understandable even. When I moved to Visalia in 2005, Christmas was less than two months away and I had three months until I could take any vacation. Spending Christmas at work was a pretty easy conclusion to come to. I didn't resent it. It sucked, but it was life. In exchange, I got to move to a fabulous new place and get the escape I had so desired.</p>

<p>At the same time I was grabbling with the fact that I couldn't see my family then, I was jotting down a vacation for this very week. I wanted the few odd days I had left of vacation for the year to pile up here so I could spend at least 2006 with my family. Unfortunately, a senior coworker put all his chips down and won out (but not before quitting a week before taking the vacation, effectively preventing me from spending the holiday with my family when I very well could have). Since that avenue was blocked, I looked to New Year's and on Friday I'm gone.</p>

<p><img alt="joey.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/joey.jpg" width="300" height="225" class="insetright" align="right" />It's only four days off coupled with a weekend, but I think it will be enough. I'm flying home to Ohio to be with my mother for a few days. Just like my Georgia trip earlier this year, I am so excited about this trip. The one thing I almost can't stand about living here is the lack of familiarity. Everyone here seems to have some place to call home. They have some enclave to which they can return to. For me, all of that is no less than 2,000 miles over the Sierra. It's very seldom that I feel fulfilled by the familiar.</p>

<p>Having the opportunity to go back is like a breath of fresh air. I am looking forward to throwing Joey's tennis ball around my mother's backyard and harassing that little dog in the fresh layer of snow. I got my mother some thoughtful gifts and I look forward to seeing what she thinks of them. I can't wait to see my grandma and wish her a Merry Christmas in person and thank her again for all she did for me last year. </p>

<p>Dayton represents to me this mysterious, marginal place. I was born there but I have never had a real connection there. Answering the question, "Where are you from?" has always presented a problem for me. Looking down the runway now, setting aside any other plans I would have for New Year's (and they range from a fabulous wedding to imploding of a Showgirls landmark), I realize Ohio has become something new for me. Now, I am just happy I am going home.</p>

<p>And in three months, I just get to do it again...</p>

                              <p>On the heels of my entry discussing the revelation that soy makes men gay, I am not surprised to see this coming:</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.ajc.com/health/content/shared-auto/healthnews/bhvr/600136.html">Kids with high IQs grow up to be vegetarians</a><br>
<strong>HealthDay</strong>

<p><img alt="vegetarian.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/vegetarian.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" class="insetright" />As a child's IQ rises, his taste for meat in adulthood declines, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>British researchers have found that children's IQ predicts their likelihood of becoming vegetarians as young adults -- lowering their risk for cardiovascular disease in the process. The finding could explain the link between smarts and better health, the investigators say.</p>

<p>"Brighter people tend to have healthier dietary habits," concluded lead author Catharine Gale, a senior research fellow at the MRC Epidemiology Resource Centre of the University of Southampton and Southampton General Hospital.</p>

<p>Recent studies suggest that vegetarianism may be associated with lower cholesterol, reduced risk of obesity and heart disease. This might explain why children with high IQs tend to have a lower risk of heart disease in later life.</blockquote></p>

<p>It's really funny how the story caught a lot of buzz in the newsroom. I am, shocker, the only vegetarian in the building to speak of (as far as I know). There are plenty of ex-vegetarians, and they are always asking me what's going to push me back to the dark side. I have no idea, honestly, I think when my boyfriend cooks me a big turkey for Thanksgiving or someone sends me a Chick-fil-A chicken biscuit express mail that I'll cave.</p>

<p>Being a vegetarian is positively fabulous. For one, it's always fun to take the moral high ground. I personally do it for nutritional reasons, but I have not shuttered at the idea of wagging my finger when it's funny or convenient. I mean, I cringed running in Yokohl Valley passing all the beef cattle. It's sad to think of all the delicious hamburgers that came from those doe-eyed fatlings.</p>

<p>Next Friday, for our newspaper's holiday party, I am bringing in plenty of fake chicken for everyone. It's going to be delicious, I'll be sure to convert someone or at least get some pompous brat taste the nugget and complain all party on how it tasted like tree bark or something. Oh well, those carnivores are too stupid to understand anyways.</p>

I have neglected my blog for two straight weeks now. And it's not like I don't have things to write. I totally have plans. Three entries have been percolating — one on The Color Purple, the second movie that made me cry; one beginning a series of entries about my training for second marathon; and another one on this album I've been listening to the past year, Nada Surf's Let Go, which is just flippin' awesome.</p>

<p>Anyways, for now, I'm going to chime in with a beautiful photo of Marilyn Monroe. I added Gentleman Prefer Blondes recently and I can't wait to see it. Of course, I must first sift through the latest season of my favorite lesbian show and throw back another disk of the Golden Girls. But for now I can bask in beauty of Norma Jean.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe, but I have been a Californian for a year now. A year ago today I pulled my car up to my new apartment after a week of driving across America. I left my mother, grandmother and Joey in Miamisburg, Ohio and for four days made my way across Interstate 70 to the great state of California. It was an exhilarating experience, one I had been waiting on for so long. I wanted so much after graduation to go some place new and different. Fulfilling that goal was a terrific rush.</p>

<p>A year later, I'm still in the Valley. My apartment is so much more than just the exhumed contents of my packed car and the futon I assembled on my first night in my new apartment. I am so much more than that green, young copy editor from Georgia. I have accomplished so much since I've arrived here. </p>

<p>In just one year, I have bought furniture and things for my apartment, trained and completed a marathon, climbed the tallest mountain in the state and even fulfilled my promise to my good friend Nicole and made it all the way to France. I'm so thankful for the opportunities afforded to my since I got my job. I feel I have purpose and direction which a year ago were things I desperately sought. My life here is invigorating and I look forward to what the next year has to offer.</p>

<p>A year from now, I hope things will be very different. My goal is to apply to graduate school in the fall with an assistantship at a school in California or hopefully in Washington D.C. or New York (two places I have dreamed to have lived). Before I do that, though, I hope to achieve more in New Media at my newspaper. On the Saturday after Thanksgiving, I will begin training for my next marathon, the Georgia Marathon on March 25 in Atlanta, Ga., which I will be running with my friend Marilia. I am also ironing out the details of a trip to Las Vegas with my friend Jeremy to see our fabulous friend Padmini and visit the hallowed landmark The Cheetah, where they filmed the film classic "Showgirls." I'm going back to Ohio early this January to see my mother and grandmother. I may also be going to see Jeremy in Ann Arbor, Mich., next year.</p>

<p>Apologies, setting goals like this keeps me motivated and keeps things interesting. Like I said, I accomplished so much this last year, and if I hadn't laid out so much I probably would have just wasted away in the boring Central Valley.</p>

<p>Well, before I go, I thought it might be interesting to share my iTunes Top 25 Most Played playlist over the past year. Here it is:</p>

It's pretty sweet, check it out.</p>

                              <p>Sorry about that stupid idiotic thing I posted last night. My grandfather did pass away yesterday and it was very troubling, but I should point out I am at peace about it. I'm am doing just fine (I had just a bit too much wine and I watched a depressing episode of Buffy).</p>

<p>By the grace of God, I actually spoke to him yesterday. I hadn't spoken to him since I visited in May this year. I told him about my marathon that I ran in June and also my grueling hike up Mt. Whitney in August. He used to live in California so he was aware of the mountain. I told him I loved him and that I would be coming back to Georgia in March to run the Georgia Marathon and I was looking forward to seeing him. That's not going to happen but I find I cannot feel bad about it. It's incredible that I spoke to him the day he died and I was able to make peace with him and tell him that I loved him. It's truly incredible.</p>

<p>I'm in Reno this week and I will post some pictures later. I had a bad sinus headache coming over the Sierra today. My coworkers made fun of my ravings for veggie dogs (don't ask why the subject of my vegetarianism came up in conversation, it always seems to be a hot topic). Tomorrow is going to be a long day and I may do some gambling tomorrow evening. I won't win anything, but what the hey, I can try.</p>

<p>Thanks for your kind words, I'm doing just fine. I loved my grandfather, but he is in a better place. I may be going to his funeral at Arlington Cemetery, so maybe I will reflect on him then. Right now, I am just still absorbing it. But I'm doing just fine (I just need to stay away from my computer as well as my cell phone if I decide to have a lot of wine again).</p>

<p>Good night (what did people think of my France pictures?? They are <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aliensexfiend/sets/72157594312998403/">here</a>, go see them!)</p>

<p>Some of the France posts are up. I have pictures <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/aliensexfiend/sets/72157594312998403/">here</a>. I'm sorry, but this week is kind of complicated. It's been kind of rough. I had a lot of wine tonight because, I don't know. I've been watching "The Body," an episode of Buffy. It's sad.</p>

<p>I'm going to Reno tomorrow probably. I'm not sure what to think about it. Leave me a message, that would be nice.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have to think of something else, like sleep or running. I like to sleep and run.</p>

<p>Good-night.</p>

I am on the train from the Orleans train station, Les Aubrais Orléans, and headed to la Gare d'Austerlitz...I think. It's hard to tell, of course, but I'm sure that's where I'm going. I've just left Nicole and it was very sad to depart. I had a fabulous time being with my friend and seeing just a glimmer of her life in France. I know that if Nicole was in America, I would be in constant contact, and I'm glad that I was able to at least see her in France since I cannot see her often in America.</p>

<p>The past few days have been pretty incredible. I knew that I would regret not taking the oportunity to explore Paris so I was sure not to neglect seizing upon that this Thursday. Originally, the intent of all this was for Nicole to be out of classes and for the two of us to spend as much time possible exploring France or just cavorting around Angers. Her sudden move to Orléans changed that so my vacation became a more subdued, leisurly habitation of Orléans accented by Nicole's companionship and wonderful cooking.</p>

<p>I'm glad things worked out this way. My vacation to Georgia several months ago was so rushed, I had almost no time to relax (with the exception of the one night I got to stay at the Hotel Mary-Kate). I'm glad I got to spend time in Orléans exploring and taking it easy. Since Nicole was in class on Thursday for most of the day and I didn't want to have to tag along (sitting through French Administrative Law is pretty damn boring, especially if you don't know French), so I took the train to Paris.</p>

<p>I was scared at first. It was the first time I had ever traveled by myself in a foreign city. I'm so glad I seized the opportunity because I had a wonderful time. I enjoyed myself most shopping by the Arc de Triomphe. I got a Louis Vutton bag for Melinda as I promised and was able to replace my camera's memory card. I got some fabulous photos walking through Paris, by the Louvre and on the way to the Eiffel Tower.</p>

<center><img alt="eiffel1.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/eiffel1.jpg" width="400" height="215" /></center>

<p>Standing beneath the Eiffel tower, I was of course tempted to make the ascent. It was sort of a spiritual calling &#8212; I remember the first time I topped the Eiffel tower when I last visited Paris about six years ago (pictured above). I felt so excited and awed by the experience. I couldn't pass it up this time around so I spent the 11 Euros for the timeless thrill. </p>

<p>Afterward, as I had used up all of my Paris time, I had to scoot back to Austerlitz and head back to Orléans just in time to miss dinner. It was worth it though. I'm glad I went. Had I listened to my inhibitions, I probably would have stayed in Orléans, too fearful of making the solo trip. It was a great thing for me and by the end of the day, when ever a silly Parisian came to talk to me in French, I didn't even sweat saying, "Oh, I don't speak French." In fact, I probably looked more Parisian than ever. Well, maybe...</p>

<p>Long flight ahead, I'll write again about the trip after I've arrived in San Francisco. Au revoir!</p>

                              <p>Bonjour from France! This is actually my second entry since my vacation has started, but since Nicole practically lives in the dark ages, without Internet, this is the first time I will actually be able to post something to my blog.</p>

<p><img alt="class.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/class.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="right" class="insetright"/>Well, I'm alive and well. My time in France so far has been very restful and pleasant. I arrived in Paris early Sunday and made my way to Orleans to meet up with Nicole. Orleans is a fabulous city and I am very happy to know that such a small town can still be very vibrant and interesting (unlike certain Valley cities I know).</p>

<p>Right now, Nicole is plugging away in some boring French class and I'm in the university library on the Internet. Ah, precious Internet...you have no idea how annoying it has been trying to pick through world events with my limited understanding of French while watching the evening news. This morning, for example, I figured the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, had addressed the United Nations, but I had no idea what he said. They even dubbed ol' Dubya in French and I couldn't overhear what he was saying in plain English. Also, The screen kept scrolling this text "Thai PM declares state of emergency" and "Tanks surround compound of Thai PM," but the newscaster would never elaborate on the story. How frustrating...</p>

<p>I've been kicking around the idea of going to Paris tomorrow by myself, but I still am not sure I'm ready to take the plunge. I think it would be good for me and would give Nicole and Alain a break from babysitting me (though it is nice to have the flat to myself for a nice nap -- this is my vacation after all! The past two mornings I have been up to run with Nicole, and boy is she fast! The first day it was like a 30-minute sprint, I could hardly keep up! Today I could tell she slowed down for me...I was really hoping to school her too. I guess I still have a lot of training to do.</p>

<p><img alt="joan.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/joan.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left" class="insetleft"/>As for the rest of the week, Friday I will probably go shopping with Nicole. I have been so impressed with the beautiful French people and how wonderfully they dress. I think the era of the T-shirt has ended for me, I really need to learn to dress with more style. Hopefully Nicole can help me out.</p>

<p>I should also note that I have really enjoyed the French food Nicole and Alain have treated me to. Every day, for breakfast, lunch and dinner, Nicole has prepared exciting, inventive and delicious meals. Every day at noon, it is a tradition for the French to have a hearty lunch. From Nicole's flat in Orleans, you can hear the cathedral bell ring at noon every day and watch the school children scurry home for this very important meal. </p>

<p>Unlike American meals, French meals traditionally come in courses. At first, I thought Alain and Nicole were throwing a bunch of food at me because they thought I was hungry. At the end of the meal I finally realized it was all part of the tradition. Most meals start of with a sort of appetizer. Today, Nicole and I had steamed zucchini and French bread. For the entree, we had pasta with tomato sauce and cheese -- delicious. And for dessert, Nicole had some cheese and a nectarine and I enjoyed an apple. Every meal has been like this and the three of us usually spend an hour together talking and enjoying the meal.</p>

<p>Well, apologies that I have no pictures yet. Sort of a technical problem I explained earlier but will post later. I will be sure to posthumously color up this entry, but for now this is what you've got. I will try to post again later this week. Thanks for the well wishes, I will see you all soon!</p>

<p>Greetings from France. I'm not certain when this will reach the world wide web, but I am writing it anyways. It's Monday night now at 10:56. I have been in France for almost two days now, and it's fabulous!</p>

<p>I am not taking the tourist route this time around. Staying with Nicole in Orléans has been a great experience. Seeing the people of France go about their normal, day-to-day lives is very interesting. It's nice to see how a whole different world behaves. Also, I must admit, French people are so attractive and dress very nicely. I told this to Alain, Nicole's boyfriend this morning when we were preparing to pick her up from the University...I'm not sure he got the compliment. I guess high fashion is just the minimum.</p>

<p><img alt="cathedral.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/cathedral.jpg" width="300" height="225" align="left" class="insetleft"/>We went to a large cathedral today &#8212; requisite of any trip to France it seems. It was very beautiful (made me a little proud to at least have some tacit understanding of a higher power unlike <em>some</em> atheist French people I know). I said a prayer, lit and candle and awed over the exquisite surroundings. A kind old Frenchman approached us and shared some of the history of the Cathedral. Apparently, when the structure was being built, Joan of Arc used to pray at the site when it still was an old Roman Christian chapel. Joan of Arc apparently liberated England's siege of Orléans in 9 days. She still has a strong presence in Orléans.</p>

<p>I think tomorrow will be more low key than today was. I'm sure Nicole has many more classes to attend. She's in law school of course! We are going running early in the morning and I'm aching for a good jaunt. Any excuse to see some more sexy French men...</p>

                              <p>I've been pretty busy this last week. On the behest of the newspaper, I took upon myself my second Flash project: <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/news/multimedia/miracleleague.swf">"Miracle on the diamond": The Miracle League of Visalia</a>. It was my first reporting assignment for the newspaper. Though the emphasis for me was the audio and Flash editing, the most intimidating part of the assignment was actually going on location and getting the story. I have to say, despite my reservations, it went really well.</p>

<p>The Miracle League of Visalia is a baseball league for special-needs kids that plays twice a year, 16 weeks a year. The organizers of the program were inspired by the first Miracle League established in Conyers, Ga., which they learned about from a segment on HBO's Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel. I watched the video in preparation for my interview, and it was pretty inspiring. </p>

<p>These kids spend their whole lives sequestered from the rest of the world, denied living a normal childhood just because they are different. The Miracle League makes it possible for special-needs kids to play baseball on their own teams.</p>

<p>I was so inspired by the men and women who make something like this possible. The man responsible was so humble, he asked me specifically that his actions not be played prominently in the presentation and that the focus remain on these amazing athletes. I tried my very best to make that possible and I believe I produced a fine presentation. It is a vast improvement on the Mt. Whitney presentation, as I was able to include the navigation buttons. I hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>As far as the Web site, I have been working on it on and off this week. The blog is completely prepared and all I must do is prepare the auxiliary pages that will include my portfolio and past Web sites. It looks very cool, I can't wait to publish it. You can expect it on Thursday night, hopefully.</p>

<p>And in less than a week, I will be in France! I will post something about that later. Oh, and running is going fabulous, though I have to run a day early this week. Friday is going to be insanely busy...and don't get me started about Saturday. I will spend about 10 hours on the ground the whole day!</p>

<p>I know, it's so unlike me to be self-aggrandizing, right? I have been meaning to get to it all summer, but it has been over a year since I've had a bone fide Web site. Granted, this little place came about because I wanted to have a blog again, but it's so insignificant. I am capable of so much more.</p>

<p>Well, I'm happy to say that this morning I finally got off my toushie and put something together that has gone surprisingly smoothly. I'm so excited about it, I think I will likely have it ready before I take off to Paris for a week (which is coming up in just less than two weeks from now!)</p>

<p>The site will consist of mostly this blog. Past Web sites I've done have been pretty personal, and though I will link to those sites, I want to continue in the direction this site is going in. I think the content is so much better than what I used to churn out.</p>

<p>There will also be links to my online portfolio of work and information on hiring me to build a Web page of your very own. Stay tuned! Hopefully I won't be so crazy busy with running and packing that I will have something together very soon.</p>

I know I have resolved to running the inaugural Georgia Marathon, but that's like months away. I can't even start seriously training for it until November (which, damn, is so much sooner than I think, you know?) For now, I'm so looking forward to my next vacation...</p>

<p><img alt="eiffeltower.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/eiffeltower.jpg" width="275" height="367" align="right" class="insetright" />On September 16, on what will be a grueling, unpleasant day, I will be flying to Paris, France. I've been meaning to do this for so long! Almost a year and a half ago, when I was visiting my expatriate friend Nicole in Marietta, Ga., I promised her that that summer I would go to see her Angers, France. Sadly, my search for a job went on a bit longer than I had hoped, so I had to nix the trip for that year. Since I am happily employed and have a second week of vacation to spare (my first week was spent seeing friends and family in Georgia), I am going to Europe!</p>

<p>It's not going to be one of those frou-frou trips you might be thinking about. While I will be spending some time in Paris, I will be mostly hanging out with Nicole in Orleans, which is not very far south of Paris. We've been exchanging e-mails and I'm getting more and more pumped about my trip. The last time I saw her, over a pitcher of margaritas at Taco Mac, I promised to enjoy some fine French hops with her (I am not a fan of beer so she will have the opportunity of deflowering me). That's really all I have in mind to accomplish while I'm visiting, but I'm sure she has some ideas for me as well.</p>

<p>I have been ruing the day of my departure, how exactly I'm supposed to get to San Francisco at 8 a.m. has confounded me. I know I can just park in long-term parking, but that's not very appealing to me. A coworker has offered to take me along with her to catch my flight but I may have to take a train back to Visalia. It's kind of exciting...</p>

<p>So yah, just to say what's next for me, it's France! A whole week in France. I'll be sure to post photos and chime in now and then (God knows I won't be able to work a phone card). Au revoir!</p>

<p>It's absolutely crazy to think that a week ago I was still on Whitney. I've had a week to think about the experience (and produce a special Flash presentation of it for the Visalia Times-Delta which you can view <a href="http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/news/multimedia/Whitney.swf" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>

<p>Several months ago, I was asked by Laura at work if I wanted to join her and others on a hike up Mt. Whitney, which she had surmounted less than a year prior at the time with another copy editor from the paper. I enthusiastically agreed, seeing it as an opportunity to do something truly unique in Tulare County. Mt. Whitney it just at the corner of the county in Sequoia National Park between the county and Inyo County and Inyo National Forest. Since I was in the midst of training for a marathon, the thought of topping a 22-mile hike up a 14,505 foot mountain seemed like a piece of cake. I was so wrong.</p>

<p>Hiking Mt. Whitney is not picnic. Aside from the head-pounding altitude, there are 96 relentless switchbacks that are seemingly never ending and so very discouraging. It took 16 hours to get off that freaking mountain, and in just a scant few paragraphs, I will attempt to boil down the experience for you.</p>

<p><img alt="whitney2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whitney2.jpg" width="275" height="367" align="right" class="insetright" />We left for the hike on Saturday morning at 4 a.m. We didn't start the hike until 24 hours after this point, but it was important that we arrive to receive our hiking permit first thing in the morning and have a day of camping to acclimate ourselves to the vicious altitude (which, by nominal standards, isn't that bad. I mean, it's no Everest). You would think since Mt. Whitney is in the county, it would be a short drive away. Also, since it's the tallest mountain in the state and the whole 48 contiguous United States, you might think you would see it from my living room window. All not true. Mt. Whitney is on the far eastern side of the Sierra Nevada and Visalia is nestled on the Western side of the range. We had to drive south to Bakersfield to go around the whole freaking range an into Owens Valley, a graben.</p>

<p>Once we made it to Lone Pine, a small town ness led at the base of Mt Whitney (which was in plain view at this point), we went to get our permit. Interesting note about Lone Pine, it is where most of the Westerns during the Golden Age of Hollywood were filmed.</p>

<p>With permit in hand, Laura, myself and Tiffani (my boss at the paper) made our way up to the Whitney Portal where we were to camp. It was a short drive and my car handled it well (though it nearly overheated). The trail begins at 8,000 feet (Owens Valley, a high desert, is 4,000 feet). I wasn't being hammered by the elevation at this point and I spent most of Saturday relaxing, taking in the scenery and preparing my hiking pack.</p>

<p>We started out at 3 in the morning, waking up and having breakfast. The sky was absolutely breathtaking. I have never in my whole life seen such a complete view of the sky. Looking up at that moment made me wish we had reached the summit at midnight. It was truly amazing.</p>

<p>Starting the hike was pretty easy. The first three hours breezed by, and soon the sun was up and we were approaching Trail Camp. Most hikers will hike from the portal to Trail Camp before making the final ascent up the mountain. Oh, but not us...we had to do it on one day!</p>

<p><img alt="whitney3.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whitney3.jpg" width="275" height="367" align="left" class="insetleft" />Once I reached the Whitney zone (which required the permit) and Trail Camp, the switchbacks were pretty difficult. They weren't too frequent until beyond Trail Camp, where an endless parade of switchbacks eventually made me a very unhappy camper. At this point, my head was throbbing from the elevation, we were much higher than we were at Alta Peak (nearly 12,000 feet in elevation). I would have to stop at several points just to take a breather until the pounding subsided (which quickly reached its fevered pitch whenever I started the ascent again). I was pretty far ahead of the others (Laura quit early on but Tiffani and her boyfriend Ethan were still with me), but as the elevation had more of an effect on me, I had to slow down and hike with the group.</p>

<p>We reached Trail Crest, a feat in of itself, and we entered Sequoia National Park on the western side of the mountain. I thought we were nearly done, but the trail continued for another two grueling hours (but minus the switchbacks, thankfully. Just a steady steep grade, oh joy!) At times during this point, Tiffani and Ethan were far ahead of me, as the elevation wreaked havoc on my head. I caught up though.</p>

<p>After what seemed like forever, we finally reached the summit and I plopped myself on a rock and enjoyed some lunch. Some fearless birds came along and shared some of my lunch with me, it was pretty cool. But, as is all too true with hikes like this, reaching the top is only half of the story. The hike down was just brutal.</p>

<p>I reached the trail head at just after 8 p.m. (we reached the summit at 1 p.m. but didn't leave until 2 p.m.) The hike down was by far the worst part. I relied heavily on my filter water bottle since I had run completely out of bottled water. By the time I reached Trail Camp, I had so many blisters on my feet, but I knew resting every few hundred feet would only mean my blistered would get worse having to endure longer on the mountain, so I tore it up on the way down. I didn't care how much my feet hurt, I wanted to be off that mountain as quickly as possible. I was so relieved when I reached my car, I felt like bursting into tears, that's how significant the moment was.</p>

<p>So, having reflected on the hike, I feel confident in saying the hike was so much worse than running a marathon. Granted, it was only 22 miles, but you have no idea how long a hiking mile is until you've actually tried it. It's no picnic. Also, at least the marathon was over in 5 hours. If I have to spend 16 hours on a mountain more than 2 miles from a comfortable tent and sleeping bag ever again in my life, it will be too soon.</p>

<p>But, who am I kidding? I said I'd never run a marathon again, and just this week I resolved to run the inaugural Georgia Marathon with Marilia on March 25, 2007. Who knows, I may be taking a trip up Whitney next year.</p>

<p>If you feel up to it, do let me know.</p>

<p>A year ago today, it was my first day in Ohio after leaving Georgia after ten years. My time in Ohio was brief and fairly uneventful, but leaving Georgia was such a huge thing for me, it's just been on my mind. I'm glad I left, though. I feel like leaving proved to me that I could go anywhere. I'm sure one day California will seem dull, and knowing I have left Georgia with much success will mean that I could conceivably go anywhere. Anyways, that's my Georgia piece. Short and painless...</p>

<p>We're hiking up Whitney this weekend. Still not sure if we're doing it in one day or two. I'm aiming for one, which will be rough, but at least I can make it to work on Monday.</p>

<p>Since the Whitney portal is on the eastern side of the park in Inyo County (and there is no direct way to the east side without going around the whole mountain range), it's going to take us probably 4 hours just to drive there. We get to drive through Tehachapi, which was this neat city I blazed through when I was going from Vegas to Visalia. </p>

<p>I had a dream about Mt. Whitney last night. Something about it being almost like some rest stop in the highway, like those fiber glass dinosaurs on the side of some interstate. I know I'll be fine, hopefully it can help jump start my exercise routine which has been languid these past few weeks. The heat here has been positively unbearable, it's hard to motivate yourself to do anything.</p>

<p>Anyways, kudos to Shirley for this entry's photo element. I keep listening to "Cup of Coffee," and this photo always reminds me of that song.</p>

<p>Oh, and Diaspora sucks (ain't that right Jeremy).</p>

<p>P.S.: I thought I would post more pictures from Alta Peak. Check them out at my Flickr page <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aliensexfiend/">here</a>. One of these days I'm going to have to put in a module, maybe Padmini will have to show me how...</p>

                              <p>Sorry I've been so scarce. I had a positively dreadful week last week. After my hike up Alta Peak and the excruciating sunburn I received because of it, work was such a drag. Monday and Tuesday was just unbearable, I somehow made it through to the end of the week. I had to work on Friday night, which is always a bore, but this weekend I had the distinct pleasure of seeing my good friend Padmini in Southern California.</p>

<p>Padmini is involved with Teach for America and she is teaching a class of bright kids in a Compton middle school, and from the way she tells it, these kids are very lucky. Granted, they struggle in an unequal education system where they have been neglected for years, but thanks to the dedication and hard work of Teach for America teachers like Padmini, they have a fighting chance.</p>

<p>I had the lucky opportunity to whisk her away from this god-saving work for a superficial day out on the town. We went to this delicious Indian Food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard. I hadn't eaten anything all morning, and though I was not sure what I was eating exactly, I had every bite. It was fantastic.</p>

<p><img alt="walkoffame.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/walkoffame.jpg" width="275" height="258" align="right" class="insetright" />Afterward, we parked down by the Kodak Theatre and took a stroll down Hollywood Boulevard. We sorted around through American Apparel and took a stroll down the Walk of Fame. I am sad to say I did not find Humphrey Bogart on the walk, but I did see Marilyn Monroe! She's in front of McDonald's, but as Padmini said, it's was probably not always there.</p>

<p>The weather this weekend in California was positively scorching so after some water and a milk shake (and another trip to American Apparel) we headed back to Long Beach, where she is staying. We hooked up with B.J., another friend of mine from college, and we ventured to yet another vegetarian restaurant. Au Lac. We all shared vegan lobster, salmon and sweet and sour chicken. Afterwards, we went to a great tea shop and played some games. I must point out that I dominated every game of Connect Four and there was significant cackling involved with a sinister game of Uno (which I also won, at least once).</p>

<p>I stayed over the night and after a delightful drive through gay Long Beach, we had some bagels and I headed home. It was the most fun I've had in Los Angeles by far. I'm looking forward to seeing Padmini at her new digs in Las Vegas. Maybe some day, after she's made it as a successful teacher and performer at the legendary Cheetah gentleman's club, I'll let her take me on in Connect Four again :-)</p>

<p>But I'll still win... </p>

<p>I'll be sure to update more this week. I'm planning some stuff on this persistant heat wave, maybe the Bush veto, the violence in the middle east, but sadly, no more <i>InuYasha</i>. I'll only beat that dead horse if it comes back from the dead...again.</p>

                              <p><img alt="altapeak.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/altapeak.jpg" width="275" height="242" align="right" class="insetright" />Of all the things I could have done Sunday, the <em>last</em> thing on my list was climbing an 11,240 foot mountain. I could have slept in, partied it up into the wee hours of the morning in Fresno Saturday night or even talked to my long-lost expatriate friend who lives in France (who actually called when I was on the hike!) I guess, having lived so close to Sequoia National Park for so long and still not having the pleasure of visiting, my curiosity got the better of me.</p>

<p>I have hiked a few mountains in my day. Compared to the peaks I see just outside my window every morning, you could more accurately describe my past experience as mounting glorified hills. California mountains are no joke. I was a big fearful the altitude and terrain would be a challenge for me, but I can honestly say I did quite excellent. It was quite a ride though.</p>

<p>In preparation of my Mt. Whitney hike on August 6th, I went with a friend from work to tackle Alta Peak, a 6-mile hike. We started out from Visalia at 6:30 a.m. and didn't make it to the trail head until 8:30. The drive up was fantastic. You take 198 through the foothills and finally along side the Kaweah River into Three Rivers. From there, it's up until you get to Sequoia Park and then up several windy roads. You could see Moro Rock as we drove higher up into the park. Finally we got to the Giant Forest and I got my first glimpse of the world's largest trees.</p>

<center><img alt="altahike.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/altahike.jpg" width="350" height="263" /></center>

<p>We started at Wolverton and the first hour and a half just flew by. We hiked through about 2 miles of woods and it was fairly easy. We saw a deer right on the onset of the hike and I got a nice picture of its butt. Once we made it to Panther Gap, you could see out into the mountain range, it was pretty spectacular. We passed this rock that's supposed to look like a bear, but it looked like a big rock to me. The hike sort of dragged at this point and I got pretty annoyed at the steadily sharper grades as we approached Alta Meadow. I told my fellow hiker who had only talked me into the trek a day earlier that I had several four letter words saved for her once we finished this hike.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean 'fun' with two N's?" she retorted. Yeah. Right.</p>

<p>After Alta Meadow, a mere two miles from the peak, it started to suck. The grades became as severe as 19% and it became very difficult to keep a steady pace without taking frequent breathers. The altitude never gave me more than some sinus trouble and some shortness of breath, but I gave myself the benefit of a doubt if I felt too strained. Better to take it easy the first time.</p>

<p><img alt="whitneyfar.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/whitneyfar.jpg" width="300" height="186" align="left" class="insetleft" />We finally got to the point where the tree started to disappear and the peak finally <em>seemed</em> to be in sight. Even this late in the summer there remained pockets of snow all around the peak. It was a relief to put a pile of that on my head. As I ascended, there would always be a pile of rocks blocking my view of the top and it would always seem to be just beyond them. I'd push it to get up to the rocks but there always seemed to be <em>another</em> outcropping, which quickly became very annoying. Finally, with the site of a fellow hiker triumphantly perched at the peak, I bee lined it straight to the summit.</p>

<p>It was quite a view. There were a lot of flies, that was annoying, but you've got to give it up for the view. I even saw Mt. Whitney in the distance. It's amazing to think I will be at the top of the Sierra Nevada range in just a couple weeks.</p>

<p>Long story short, the descent was easier than the climb, but descending the steep grades was very bothersome for my knees. I almost slipped several times. I tore it up through most of the trail and we made it out a whole hour earlier than planned.</p>

<p>I wish I had more adventurous friends and family that would be willing to share an experience like this with me. I too often hear people complain about how they could never accomplish such a feat. It really isn't that bad, you never know you can accomplish something as daring as a mountain hike. I remember thinking Kennesaw Mountain back in Georgia was so incredible, but this was 10 times the difficulty as that. It's an incredible feeling surmounting a height like Alta Peak. I can't imagine what Whitney is going to do for me.</p>

<p>In the aftermath: I have a nasty sunburn, my legs were surprisingly filthy (I wore long jeans!) and I am thinking I might do it again next weekend to further train myself for Whitney. We'll see how that goes, I'd like to see a friend of mine in Long Beach, so maybe it will be a SoCal weekend instead of another day touching the sky.</p>

<p>God I love California.</p>

                        <h3 class="entry-header">She's still dead</h3>
                        <div class="entry-content">
                           <div class="entry-body">
                              <p><img alt="light1.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/light1.jpg" width="275" height="325" class="insetright" align="right" />I know I should just get off it, but come on...she's really dead! I mean, I know I said she was going to die last week, but the bitch exploded into a blaze of light and souls. I don't think anyone walks away from that.</p>

<p>I mean, there are some many things I could be writing about, but I can't help it. There's a budding war in the Middle East (one we didn't actually start), Valerie Plame is suing Karl Rove because Patrick Fitzgerald is too much of a pussy to indict him and I am faced with the daunting reality that I may actually die hiking up Mt. Whitney in less than a month (more on that later).</p>

<p>And all of this is going on and I still can't stop thinking about Kikyo. I mean, it's not like the death of Superman or anything, but it's like a damn Greek tragedy. You know the kind. She's like the tragic hero, except in this case everyone refers to her as the tragic priestess Kikyo. She's doomed to fall in love, falter in her sacred duty and suffer an untimely death. And even after all that happens, after she's brought back a vengeful, walking-clay pot of her former self she's still brought down like a dog. It's just typical.</p>

<p><img alt="light2.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/light2.jpg" width="275" height="313" class="insetleft" align="left" />It isn't the first time one of my favorite heroines has bitten the big one (twice even). We all remember Buffy, don't we? At the end of season 1, they pull that whole, "she's fated to die at the hands of the Master" crap and sure enough, she falls into a puddle and "dies." Luckily, someone was paying attention in CPR and she dodged that bullet. We all thought she was home free.</p>

<p>But then, four years later, when she should have just thrown her sister off Glory's twisted Tower of Babel, she makes up some crap about their blood being the "same Summer's blood" and chucks herself to her own untimely demise instead. I, of course, ignorant of Internet spoilers, didn't see it coming and was completely blind sided. Fortunately, slayers are more like the phoenix than the lamb, and she was back with bells on by the end of the next episode.</p>

<p>Let's have a reality check for just a moment. Yeah, Kikyo has drifted up into the sky among a convoy of soul collectors, but who says this is the end? I mean, she's been stuck down before, who says she can't come back as a phantom or a vision? Who says she can't be some possessing spirit? She could come back from beyond on a visit and provide key insight in our hero's bleakest moments and then drift back up to wherever it is clouds of souls go.</p>

<p><img alt="light4.jpg" src="http://www.endlessone.com/blog/light4.jpg" width="310" height="150" class="insetright" align="right" />Anyways, it's over now. The manga can now march in a new direction. With Kikyo out of the picture, I guess Kagome should give Inuyasha maybe a month to mourn for his twice-dead lover and then swing in for the rebound. I mean, they look <em>exactly</em> the same in the manga, it shouldn't be hard for him to adapt.</p>

<p>Well, she said not to mourn, so it's time to move one. Hopefully there will be no moving scenes in next week's issue and I won't feel compelled to waste this space talking about it. Here's hoping!</p>

<p>I can't believe it. I mean, who would have seen it coming? It appears the tragic priestess Kikyo has died. Or is dying, whatever.</p>

<p>Ok, so why is this a big deal? Well, I don't know. Kikyo is the lost love of anime/manga character InuYasha. Technically, this isn't the first time she has died (and it might not be the last), but since the manga is steadily marching toward its big conclusion, I am forced to consider that this is indeed Kikyo's swan song.</p>

<p>I got into <em>InuYasha</em> about 2 and a half years ago out of curiosity. A friend of mine was very into anime, this one imparticular, and all of a sudden I was pulled into the plot. The anime follows the adventures of InuYasha and Kagome, his friend and budding love interest, as they battle demons in feudal Japan. Kikyo was InuYasha's lover from 50 years prior who sealed him to a tree as part of a tragic betrayal involving mistaken identity and their easily broken love and trust for one another. It's a very mythic, captivating story (if you <em>really</em> try to get into it). It reminds me of the Greek myth of Eurydice, but that's another story.</p>

<p>Anyways, Kikyo comes back from the dead, and she's kind of a bitch at first, but eventually she cools down and gets her eye on the ball and dedicates herself to defeating the anime's primary foe, Naraku. The anime ends rather prematurely, as manga chapters come out once a week and after 167 episodes there were no more manga chapters to adapt. After the finale, the manga continues though, and it has for almost two years now.</p>

<p>I eventually found a great site last summer which posts translated scripts from the manga. I followed it through some pretty exciting developments, all up until this week. Having come face-to-face with Naraku and his twisted ambitions, Kikyo finally makes her attempt to destroy him and fails. His jyaki (weird Japanese word translated in the anime as miasma) overcomes her and starts to kill her. Passing her bow to Kagome and spending her last moments with InuYasha, it is presumed in the next chapter Kikyo's life will end...</p>

<p>And it sucks! I only bring this stupid thing up because Kikyo has been a sort of hero for me, in a sick, twisted way. Even though Kagome is the best woman for InuYasha, I have always been sympathetic to her cruel fate and have been rooting for the lost love to take InuYasha away with her into death. Even though that's not likely to happen anymore.</p>

<p>I wrote two poems about the anime. That's really crazy, but for some reason the story inspired something in me. The figures I explored then were InuYasha and Kagome, but I have not explored Kikyo's voice yet. I know she will be the last in this trilogy of poetry, but I have spent the past few months pondering what I have to say for her. On the one hand, she's so strong and composed. On the other, she is bitter for losing her life and having to go on living a frozen death. She's very seldomly forthright with her feelings, which makes me wonder if she would be sentimental at all. I'm still thinking about it, but maybe this development could give me some ideas.</p>

<p>Anyways, if you have any interest, I suggest you venture out onto the Internet and read the chapter. It's really sad to see her go...</p>

<p>That's the number one thing I find annoying about people asking me about the marathon. They expect me the boil down a five hour and eighteen minute experience into just a few words. It's impossible! So many things happen to you during a marathon, and it took me a few days to process the whole thing myself. Well, I think I'm ready to write about it, so here goes.</p>
<p>I didn't actually look at the course map until a week before I ran the race. For some reason, knowing anything about the race was immaterial to me until I raised enough money before my fundraising deadline (by the way, I raised $2,640 for the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society). Once that was squared away, I started to actually consider running the marathon which, surprisingly, was a very funny thing. When I first looked at that map, I started laughing out loud. We run all over downtown San Diego, and when that's all done with, it's still only 10 miles! There's 16.2 miles of hell right after that!</p>
<p>Team in Training did a send-off for us. I brought tofu, rice and veggies to the potluck, but not many people had much (too bad, more for me). We got our singlets and race info. Early Saturday morning we met at the Holiday Inn on Plaza Drive. We took a slow bus to San Diego and my mentor gave me some useful advice for running my first marathon (which he had done only months earlier).</p>
<p>Sometime before or after going over the Grapevine, I was listening to &quot;The Wand&quot; off the new Flaming Lips album, tapping my feet on the ground, when I started thinking to myself...<em>I forgot my running shoes!</em> No joke. Worst possible thing you could do before running a marathon, and it happened to me. For a split second, I thought to myself, &quot;How the hell could you do something so stupid?!&quot; But a second later, I regained my composure and started to think of a solution to my problem. I would just have to buy a new pair of shoes at the Expo.</p>
<p>San Diego is very nice. It reminded me of Atlanta with lots and lots of sun. I frantically combed over the Expo looking for a New Balance booth, but I had to settle on a pair of Mizunos that actually looked very similar to the shoes I had been running in all season. After I got my timing chip, Rock 'n' Roll Marathon commemorative shirt and number, I went back to the hotel for a nap before heading out to the TNT Pasta Party at the convention center. After filling up on carbs, I was off to bed.</p>
<p><a href="http://endlessone.com/blog/sd_course_map_06.gif"><img src="http://endlessone.com/blog/sd_course_map_06.gif" width="275" length="355" hspace="10" align="left" border="1"></a>Up until that point, it was all still a big joke. I was still laughing about it at the Pasta Party, a mere 10 hours before the race started. But on the race day morning, there's nothing left to do but run. I got dressed, headed out to the bus at about 3:45 in the morning and got to the start line around 4. We had about two hours before start, so I just laid there, listening to my iPod and waited. I was in such a daze, I really felt like I could run the whole day, so I'm glad I wasn't super tired and pessimistic or it would have been so much more difficult.</p>
<p>Once we were all corralled at the front, there was no turning back. I was in corral 12, but unlike the Peachtree Road Race, which takes almost 45 minutes to get from your corral to the starting line, it was only about 7 minutes after the actual start time that I was off and running. The first few miles were not too difficult. I just ignored the new shoes and pretended not to care. I was so focused on the bands playing at the side of the road and the spectators that I didn't even notice how slowly the mile numbers trickled by.</p>
<p>I thought that maybe I would be so preoccupied at the beginning thinking about the incredible distance I was trying to surmount, but I was really ambivalent at that point. I was just in a daze, thinking about a lot of different things. I mostly took the race in 2 to 3 mile increments. At mile 2 I had some Powerade. At mile 5, I took a PowerGel and had some water. And then 2 miles later, I took some more Powerade. It's easier if you think of the race like that instead of taking on the whole behemoth at once.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I hit mile 11 that I started to have some problems. I started getting a blister on my foot, which I mostly ignored. I was also hitting a point in the race where the course got kind of boring (we were running on an Interstate!) so I started to drift. I would walk through all the water stations, but I started walking 2 minutes instead of just one. I got to see my coach at around this time, so that was great motivation to keep me going up to the half.</p>
<p>The race dragged on from here, and around mile 18 I started doing intervals of walking and running. One of my team members was running at a pretty consistent pace, so she kept passing me while I was running and I kept passing her when I would start up again at a 9 minute pace. We tried to keep each other motivated, and it was great to get that encouragement at that point in the race.</p>
<p>At about mile 21 and 22, we hit this point where we did a small loop and sort of double backed on the course. I was so finished at this point, it was at this moment that I hit my &quot;wall.&quot; It was pure will power that drove me on from here. I tried to run to mile 24 and walk to 25 and put up a final sprint through to 26.2, but I mostly did my intervals. I got some encouragement from my coaches and some pointers on the finish line that were very useful.</p>
<p>But at this point, you got to realize, I was a physical wreck. I had been doing intervals for a while, and it had gotten to be so difficult to switch from running to walking and vice versa. Every time I would start running again, it was like I was pulling my legs out of stiffening concrete. I was so ready to collapse.</p>
<p>After we entered to Marine depot, my coach told me that when I saw a tunnel, I could expect to see the finish line just beyond it. Once I saw the tunnel, I was so determined to finish, I quit walking and start sprinting to the finish. I think I got to about a 6:45 pace, my best of the entire race &#8212; I was so through with it. Once I passed over the finish line, I swear it was such a rush. You think you would have something amazing to punctuate that moment, but I was so relieved and I could quite honestly have burst into tears at the moment if I had tried hard enough.</p>
<p>See, that's the thing. I learned in that moment why people are crazy enough to run marathons. I didn't want to cry because I was sad. I didn't want to cry because I was depressed, either. I wanted to cry, I believe, because I was mourning the fact that this marathon was so difficult. I took myself to my limit and then pushed myself four extra miles, and for what? There was no reclining chairs at the finish line, there was no handsome reward (except for this really nifty medal they gave us). All there was was this incredible feeling that I had survived something physically grueling and the promise that I would recover from it. I felt like, had this been some life or death situation, where I had survived some horrible ordeal, like being stranded on some mountain or something, I would experience the same exact feeling. Equal parts relief, exhaustion and triumph.</p>
<p>I got myself a bagel, (a medal), some blister relief shoes and my personal things. I called my mother and a few of my friends and then made my way back to the hotel room for a much deserved nap. After you run a marathon, you feel not unlike a midget on stilts &#8212; I felt like I could fall over at any moment. Short distances, like hunting around the TNT Victory Party for a vegetarian alternative to ribs and chicken, became major endurance treks. Oh, if I could have just sat down for 3 days...</p>
<p>But I made it. Recovery is going well, I started running again on Monday (I know, I'm crazy), and I am even planning on running a marathon again sometime. I would like to get myself more prepped for the next time around, though. I was just running this one to finish. Next time around, I want to break 4:30 :-)</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who supported me in my marathon goal! I couldn't have done it without you! </p>

It went well. 10 miles is a lot less than what we've been doing the last 2 months, but it still seemed like a lot to me. It's nice to be done with running for the day by 8 a.m. instead of 10.</p>

<p>I am in utter disbelief that I will be running a marathon in a week. I don't know what I was thinking in January, but I saw this to the end and I'm finally going to get what I've been waiting for. This year, so far, has been shaped by one thing: the marathon. </p>

<p>I knew I was going back to visit my friends in Georgia <em>before the marathon</em>. I know that, according to the little sticker on my car window, I won't have to change my oil again until <em>after the marathon</em>. Not having this huge block in the road is going to be dizzying.</p>

<p>I should point out that while I have a marathon to finish in a week, one major hurdle has already been cleared. I am certain I have made my fundraising goal for the event. Believe it or not, in exchange for training with Team in Training and gaining entry to the Rock 'n' Roll Marathon on June 4th, I had to raise $2,600 for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. That's a huge sum, and after months of stalling I finally got to it and the last week has been very successful.</p>

<p>I brought cupcakes along with hummus and pita bread to work as a friendly reminder that my fundraising deadline was the day following. I got great reception from my co-workers, and because most of them gave cash, I was able to clump all that money together and have the company I work for match the donation. If it weren't for that program, I know I wouldn't have made it.</p>

<p>I have been worried for months that my goal to run the marathon would be soured by my inability to make my fundraising goal. I knew when I signed up and when I went through recommitment that making the goal would mean I would have to learn to do things I am not comfortable with. Asking people for money is not my strong suit, but I swallowed my fear and convinced myself this was a good cause and people really responded. I'm still getting belated donations!</p>

<p>I ran with a woman this morning who is running her third Rock 'n' Roll Marathon next Sunday. Her father died of cancer and she heard that this was a very positive program to get involved with that would make a difference. I am so fortunate to not have a impetus like this. I just want to fulfill my goal of running a marathon. I feel like, though I am not personally affected by cancer, I have made a difference in the lives of people that are affected. That's going to make finishing this endeavor that much more significant.</p>

<p>Thanks to all that have made contributions to my fundraising effort! Please keep in mind that you can still make a contribution by clicking <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/tntccal/tntccalNMcclel">here</a>.</p>

<p>Wish me luck next week! San Diego, here I come!</p>

<p>Everyone has goals and resolutions. My new year's resolution is to run a marathon. It's a really dumb idea I got into my head last year after I ran in the Peachtree Road Race. That was an amazing experience, and even though 6.2 miles was well within my abilities at the time, the thought of running 26.2 miles seemed like it was impossible. I don't know why, but at that moment, I knew that at some point in my life I wanted to do it.</p>

<p>While I was looking for a job, I was considering moving someplace completely different than Georgia. When I landed in California, I thought that fulfilling my marathon goal would be a great task to take on that would help me meet other serious runners. On one boring evening back in February, I signed up to train with an organization called Team in Training, which helps train would-be marathoners and raises money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. Not only would I be fulfilling a life-long goal of mine, I would also be fighting for a noble cause.</p>

<p>The training has been grueling. Almost 2 weeks ago we hit our maximum training distance of 20 miles! That was not pleasant, let me tell you. I know that crossing that finish line is going to feel so freaking amazing, but waking up at the crack of dawn every Saturday for the past 4 months has not been a picnic. Oh, to be out on Friday night instead of woofing down carbs and going to bed early :-(</p>

<p>This week, we take on a simple 10 mile run and then we give it a rest before hitting the track in San Diego on Sunday, June 4th. I am so glad this is almost over. You have no idea what a burden training for a marathon is. I can't wait to have a spot of normalcy for a good rest-of-my-life.</p>

<p>Seriously, when people ask if I'm going to do it again, I shutter at the thought. I refuse to say I'm off marathons for good, but I would say if I ran more than eight miles in a two-hour period in the next three years, it would be too soon. We'll see how I feel after the marathon, though.</p>

<p>I have to say, it feel pretty good striking a major life goal from my list as well as fulfilling my New Year's resolution before summer. Isn't that usually a task given up sometime before Thanksgiving? Well, not for me :-)</p>

<p>Marathon training sucks, and hopefully you are spending your Saturdays doing something much more pleasant. If you want to lend a hand, though, my fundraising deadline is this Friday, May 26th! I need all the help I can get, so please, if you haven't already made a contribution, please send one my way. 75% of the funds we raise goes straight to cancer research. It's a great cause and your contribution is an essential part of my goal to complete the marathon. Please, send some love my way!</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute to my fundraising goal, please click <a href="http://www.active.com/donate/tntccal/tntccalNMcclel" target="_blank">here</a> to visit my donation page. Thanks a bunch!</p>

<p>Well, today I have to do some cross-training. Expect some more marathon news very soon!</p>

I usually finish second or third out of the entire South Valley team!]</blockquote>

                              <p>Greetings, and welcome to my new blog. I am Nick, and though this isn't the first incarnation of my blog (and it's certainly not the last), this is the first blog I have written in quite a while.</p>

<p>Last we left me, on that other Web site I used to manage, I was moving away. Well, for those who may have followed my adventures back then, you should know that I am living happily in California in the Great Central Valley in a city nessled at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. I am working for a newspaper as a copy editor and page designer. My life is quite different than when I was living in Georgia and going to school.</p>

<p>I'm writing a blog again because I miss it. I really like having the opportunity to design a Web page and produce content for it. This blog is just a basic one and will probably change a lot over the summer. I hope to make many nifty little design innovations and what not. But for now, this will serve as a place to let out some steam.</p>

<p>Ok then, as I stand here calling out into the vast emptiness of the Internet yelling, "I'm back!" and the few people that actually give a damn slowly return to read my musings, I'm just going to pretend I've just been dropped into the middle of a song. No reason to make a big production out of this.</p>

<p>It feels good to be back :-)</p>

<p>Nick</p>
