<body>Photos are primarily shot on location. All shots must be booked at least two weeks in advance. For a quote on a price, I'll need to know what kind of photos you'd like to have. Some shoots I am well suited for:

<li>senior portraits</li>

<li>headshots</li>

<li>editorial</li>

<li>private events</li>

<li>pet photos</li>

<li>band and CD cover</li>

<li>weddings</li>
Upon receiving the photos, I will retouch those selections and give you the final CD with everything included. Prints may also be included for a charge. Photos are processed within one to two weeks.

I do require a $50 sitting fee, regardless of the type of shoot you chose.

I'm located in Gainesville, Ga., and can travel if needed.

Please visit my contact page to get in touch with me.

Thank you for taking some time to look over my work, and I hope to be hearing from you soon.</body>
