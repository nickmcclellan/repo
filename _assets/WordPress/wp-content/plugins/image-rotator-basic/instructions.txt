Possible issues and things to check:

1. The plugin will not run the script if it cannot find the wp-content/header-images directory, if there are no pictures in the directory, or if the CSS ID tag for the header is incorrect.

2. You can see error messages in the 'Header Image Rotator' options page.

3. Make sure you check spelling and syntax.
