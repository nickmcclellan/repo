<p>Apologies for not updating in a while, I've been very busy this semester.  The summer is upon us once again, and <i>this</i> year I'll be staying in Athens.  I am planning on making as much money as possible this year, and it will be nice spending my free time with Matt and my many other Athens-bound friends.  Hopefully, assuming I have a good earning potential, I'll be replacing my shitty laptop at the beginning of the summer.  I may also try my hand at selling on eBay--<i>anything</i> to get my hands on some money.  I also plan on doing a few things at the Red & Black (assuming they'll have me).  Anyways, more on all that in the Blog.  This week, in celebration of Matt and my One Year anniversary, there are lots of Matt-related goodies.  Check those out.  Also, as promised, I have a new revamped Poems Page.  This one is actually good...no, seriously!</p>

<p>My site is named <a href="thursday.html">Thursday</a> after a poem I wrote during my senior year of high school. It describes a time in my life when I was dealing with many issues...issues involving sexuality, family, friends, and rejection. It was all terribly emotional and damaging, and that poem is my little souvenir.  It is really an explanation of how things seem at this place in time...I'm poised at a junction...between the horrible work week and the blissful abyss of the forthcoming weekend...between peril and pleasantness...spanning the beginning, crashing toward the end.</p>

<p>Here is a bunch of STUFF about myself. I really hope it's not boring...but then it had better not be! YOU CAME HERE TO SEE STUFF ABOUT ME, NOT MY BRAIN-DEAD FRIENDS! Enjoy!</p>

<ul>

<li><p>I'm an avid fan of the television program <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>. I'm slowly acquiring the entire series on DVD.  To learn more about the show and my thoughts on it, please visit my <a href="buffy.html">Buffy Page</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Since high school, I've been CRAZY about garbage, they are my most favorite band. Go to the <a href="garbage.html">garbage Page</a> to see my section devoted to the the music of my life!  Other than garbage, I really enjoy The Cure, The Flaming Lips, The Smiths, Patsy Cline, Kylie Minogue, Tears for Fears, and New Order</p></li>

<li><p>Yes, I'm gay, though I consider myself to be bisexual solely on the fact that I believe sexuality is a fluid thing.  I take alot of pride in being queer, but maintain that it is not all that I am.  The <a href="gay.html">Gay Page</a> offers some information on what it is to be gay and to be myself. (In other gay related news, I think Nathan Smorynski is hot)</p></li>

<li><p>I'm a writer.  For a good idea of my writing talents, you can check out my <a href="poems.html">Poems Page</a>.  Featured is the title poem for the website, <a href="thursday.html">Thursday</a>. To read the weekly exercise of my writing talents, please visit my <a href="journal.html">Blog Page</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I go to the University of Georgia. I really do enjoy things here, despite a gaping lack of diversity. I seem to manage though. If you're interested in learning more about the University, visit us at <a href="http://www.uga.edu">uga.edu</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>I am a board member of Lambda Alliance, the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgendered organization at UGA club here at the University. If you are a closeted individual at UGA, look at our site to learn more about us. It's a nice club to go to on Monday nights at 7, and you can come talk to me and see what's up. Visit <a href="http://www.uga.edu/lambda/">Lambda Online</a> to learn more about being gay and at UGA.</p></li>

<li><p>Other than Buffy, I enjoy many television shows, which include some fun cartoon programs like <i>Futurama</i>, <i>The Simpsons</i>, <i>Daria</i>, and <i>The Family Guy</i>.  Also, I watch alittle anime when it's really late and there's not much on.  I've been known to be into <i>Dragonball</i> and <i>Dragonball Z</i> and I am becoming acquainted with <i>Inuyasha</i> (thanks to April).  As far as hardcore TV watching, I'm still very involved with the Buffyverse, watching <i>Angel</i> on a regular basis.  You may also catch me watching <i>The Sunday Night Sex Show</i> from time to time.  Some of my favorite movies include <i>Amelie</i>, <i>Trois Colours: Rouge</i>, <i>Donnie Darko</i>, <i>Contact</i>, <i>Chicken Run</i>, and <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>.</p></li>

<li><p>My first dog, Brandy, was very important to me. She was put to sleep on June 14, 2001, and I miss her very much. Go to <a href="brandy.html">Brandy's Page</a> to see some wonderful pictures of her and to read about why she is so special.  You may also visit my <a href="pets.html">Pets Page</a> to see pictures of my cat Lily and my mom's dog Joey.  Both are very unique and hysterical.  Lily is the sweetest cat ever, and Joey is a prissy wimp.</p></li>

<li><p>I've worked at alot of places of the years.  I spent a year and a half at Kroger when I was 15.  I was a cashier and eventually became a U-Scan specialist.  I moved over to Target where I spent over three years working on the Sales Floor, in Electronics, as a Cashier (against my will), doing planograms, scanning markdowns, and preparing for inventory.  After ditching this, I moved to Taco Mac, a charming sports bar that features Draught Beer and Buffalo Wings.  I worked here during the summer of 2003 as a server, and there was alot of stress and nightmares (if you served, you'd understand).  Since this job, I've been in a limbo, working at Rich's - Macy's during the holidays, still quasi-employeed at Taco Mac, though looking forward to landing my first job in Athens.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>I think that may be it for 
now...what to leave you with? Well, I was thinking of giving my own 
garbage suggestion of the week or something. Check back next Sunday to see 
how I think this week is going to be as seen through the voice and sound of 
garbage!</p>
