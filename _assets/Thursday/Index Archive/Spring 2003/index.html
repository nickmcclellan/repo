<p align="left"><font face="HelvLight">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size="3" face="HelvLight">Finally, an update!  Obviously, I've decided to stop updating the main page weekly...no one looks at it anyways.  This week, however, I have something new to share--a new friends page!  It's not Ilya or Sonya because THEY AREN'T FRIENDS OF MINE AND THEY'LL NEVER HAVE A FRIENDS PAGE!  Well, maybe Ilya if he dumps Sonya and realizes he deserves more then some selfish freak maniac girlfriend.  I guess the sex is good...well, anyways, Marilia has a page now.  Also, the ever updated journal.  Expect those to continue through the summer.  Also, expect a reVAMPed Buffy page at some point in the future...and also FINALLY a link for that cherry icon.  What could that be...</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="3" face="HelvLight">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My site is 
  named <a href="thursday.html">Thursday</a> 
  after a poem I wrote during my senior year of high school.&nbsp; It describes 
  a time in my life when I was dealing with many issues...issues involving sexuality, 
  family, friends, and rejectio</font><font face="HelvLight">n.&nbsp; It was all 
  terribly emotional and damaging, and that poem is my little souvenir.&nbsp; 
  It is really an explanation of how things seem at this place in time...I'm poised 
  at a junction...between the horrible work week and the blissful abyss of the 
  forthcoming weekend...between peril and pleasantness...spanning the beginning, 
  crashing toward the end.</font></p>
