<p>The sky is curled around no moon tonight<br>
High in the dark, escaping us.<br>
Forgive these moments we discard<br>
The shadows beyond which we see nothing.<br>
I will follow constant behind your lead and surrender.<br>
It's not that we can't see this space<br>
It's that we choose not to.<br>
<br>
Coming down to the water after a rain<br>
to catch a sun set,<br>
I watched you then.<br>
Walking carefully through the mud bank<br>
avoiding every stone,<br>
and stepping into our canoe.<br>
We glide across the surface,<br>
drifting beneath the expiring sky.<br>
An orange glow pervades the scene<br>
and you sigh and half-smile.<br>
I watched you then, Kikyo,<br>
and you did not look at me.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you had your reasons.<br>
How you fist clinches and your teeth grit<br>
as his nails rip into your dress,<br>
cut into your shoulder<br>
and down your chest,<br>
just as you shiver when the blood comes down<br>
collecting in the heels of your shoe--<br>
And you think it was me.<br>
<br>
Seeing you stoop to the ground<br>
Beneath your wasted breath,<br>
Cursing me.<br>
I struggled to conceive a reason<br>
that you'd think I hurt you.<br>
And you cradle the folds of your dress<br>
bleeding, above your waist,<br>
where I held you.<br>
Your body, writhing in dirt.<br>
Filthy, dying, and in pain.<br>
<br>
You returned to me, years after your death<br>
Standing motionless in the water.<br>
Your hands, still against your side,<br>
while you stalk curiously past me<br>
like a breeze around a curtain.<br>
You pretend as if I did not recall<br>
your doubting smile, the wounding arrow<br>
and the permeating dusk.<br>
<br>
"Come with me," you whisper.<br>
"Cur, suffer me."<br>
<br>
High in the dark, a new moon waits.<br>
The sky curls above the forest<br>
where centipedes stalk quietly.<br>
The water parts as we advance,<br>
stepping deeper.<br>
<br>
Forgive my will, Kagome.<br>
You never had me.</p>
