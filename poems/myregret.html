<p>On a February evening, in a subway train,<br>
My choices have disarmed me.<br>
I stand alone—the one who listens—<br>
While a cold breeze enters the car.<br>
The woman beside me shivers against her partner;<br>
He smiles, pressing her closer.<br>
The man to my left prods his elbow into my side<br>
Moving his newspaper away from the shifting air.<br>
The cold brings tears to my squinting eyes<br>
I wipe them away onto my shoulder with my coat.<br>
My hand clinches the arm holster above me<br>
And I stare out into the window ahead.<br>
My translucent reflection appears to soar through the city<br>
Its lights cascade across my face<br>
The wind outside races by against my window<br>
Rushing a blast of flurries past.<br>
The subdued woman before me looks half-alive<br>
Her reflected eyes seeming splintered and broken—<br>
A part pressed in this train,<br>
and part crouching at your riverside.<br>
I see the people bustle beside my reflected self<br>
And I imagine you are standing here beside me,<br>
your hair wafting in the cold air<br>
Northbound, on a Friday night.<br>
<br>
On the mudbank of a sunken river<br>
In the heart of a silent forest<br>
I wait for you.<br>
At the edge of the water<br>
Kneeling in the fallen dust of your final steps<br>
I watch the sun’s dying light<br>
Laid upon the ripples you made in the water.<br>
My palms wipe the tears from my eyes<br>
and brush the dry mud from my skirt.<br>
I scream out to you, pleading that you’d regret<br>
pouring out my tears for you to live.<br>
I know your soft dying eyes can see me<br>
writhing in the violent dusk.<br>
<br>
You think I'm crazy.<br>
I'm just some stupid girl<br>
Lost at the edge of the water<br>
Wrestling with things I cannot change<br>
my shoes dug into the mud<br>
While you sink beneath the surface.<br>
Rays of milky light drift down and graze your cheek<br>
You can barely hear me in the echoing depth<br>
As your ears fill with water and your ear drums burst.<br>
<br>
You think that I don’t understand<br>
How pointless it was to love her<br>
though you earnestly tried.<br>
You think I’ll never respect<br>
The innocent seduction on that wobbling canoe;<br>
your shaking hand against her pleated blouse.<br>
And you think I could never fathom or comprehend<br>
The bitterness of her betrayal<br>
and the edge of her wounding arrow.<br>
I’ll never hear those hateful whispers<br>
she spit into your ear<br>
As she curled her legs around your thigh<br>
and promised you love in death.<br>
I am just a useless girl, of course<br>
mourning you in mud,<br>
ignorant and insensitive to the past.<br>
<br>
I can hardly see you now<br>
Dancing with her beneath the water<br>
Her brittle hands holding down your head<br>
Your hair frozen between her dead fingers<br>
As your image fades into reflected moonlight.<br>
I let out a rough sigh<br>
Clinching my fists in the dirt<br>
Whimpering as the last tear falls past my ear.<br>
I lie there for hours after the water calms<br>
My eyes soften and the tears dry<br>
The water bubbling softly beneath my exhaled breath.<br>
<br>
I remember hearing your muted cries<br>
as you laid stricken on my bedroom floor.<br>
Glancing at me through your wild, weary eyes<br>
Your shirt drenched in dried blood, pressed against your wound.<br>
I shook anxiously at your side,<br>
Petrified at what I presumed to feel<br>
Your head resting in the folds of my skirt—<br>
the starlight shone on your sleeping face,<br>
My fingers roaming through your smooth black hair—<br>
I should have known I was too stupid to love you.<br>
<br>
On that cramped subway train,<br>
Staring into the glass in front of me<br>
I am so close to the riverbank:<br>
Standing at the edge of the water<br>
Leaning toward the depth<br>
But I do not fall.<br>
My heart is still beating in my chest<br>
And I will not drown in the arms of my lover.<br>
I thought you would come for me<br>
But I thought foolishly then<br>
with the unbroken heart of a girl.<br>
<br>
This was not circumstance—a sudden ebb in the river.<br>
I am no longer the stupid girl at the edge of the water,<br>
Praying to the mysterious, shifting sky.<br>
I am the one who stares blankly into a cold glass,<br>
Living despite your wretched death,<br>
Pretending I am real.<br>
<br>
This was your will,<br>
your fevered glance—<br>
<br>
And this is my regret.</p>
