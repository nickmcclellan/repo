<strong>&quot;How is your new life?&quot; </strong>
<p><div class="pic1"><img src="photos/newlife/pic1.jpg" width="300" height="188">
<div class="caption">I got this picture from a photographer at the Times-Delta. This is the Sierra Nevada Mountains viewed from Visalia on a clear day. Breathtaking&#8212;first time I saw them I almost drove off the road. </div>
</div>...</p>
<p>I was a bit taken a back when Marilia's mother asked me that. She probably meant to say, &quot;How is your new job?&quot; but it must have come out wrong. But, then I thought about it. I do have a new life, don't I? It's very different.</p>
<p>I have been living in Visalia for about a month now. I have my own place. I have a full-time job. I even have furniture. I think the thing I can boast about the most would be my rice cooker. I absolutely love that!</p>
<p>My first few weeks in Visalia were hectic, but very interesting. I did end up getting the nice 2 bedroom, 1 bath I was gunning for. After pulling all of my stuff out of my car that Saturday, I drove around for hours looking for a futon to sleep on (at least until I had enough money to buy a bed and a mattress). It was an eventful day&#8212;some lady swung her door open when I was pulling into my Target parking space and I hit her door. Not even 48 hours and I'm involved in an accident. Great.</p>
<p>Work started on Halloween. That was freaky, considering a bunch of my fellow employees had dressed up for the occasion. The first person I saw when I walked in the door happened to be Frankenstein, prompting me to wonder if I had made the right decision coming all this way to work at a monster mash. Despite getting the creeps, I was scared that I would be overwhelmed and the paper would be disappointed with my level of experience. That wasn't the case. I didn't even design any pages the first day. When I finally did do some, I found I really did have a lot to offer.</p>
<p><div class="pic2"><img src="photos/newlife/pic2.jpg" width="300" height="220">
<div class="caption">This is a tree that grows in the middle of the road by my apartment. I run by it almost every day. I just think it's kind of cool. </div>
</div>
I have my own desk, phone and computer at work. If you can believe it, I have my own business telephone number! It's pretty cool. The coolest thing about my job is the fact that I have a brand new G5 Mac computer! It looks like a hummer, and I'm the only copy editor that has one! It's pretty nifty, even my bosses don't have one like mine.</p>
<p>Most of the time I've spent here has been preoccupied with collecting furniture for my  apartment. While I had some stuff left over from Athens, as far as necessary things like a bed and dining room table, I had nada. The first place I went was, of course, Ikea. After my first week at the Visalia Times-Delta, I went down to Los Angeles to see my friend Melissa who I went to high school with. She went with me to Burbank and went down to Hollywood Boulevard, where I was frightened by all these people dressed up as celebrities who tried to accost me. Once again, freaked out in California, but I survived. </p>
<p>A few weeks after that I got to see San Francisco for the first time. I went to visit my friend Amber, who goes to Stanford in Palo Alto. We took the Caltrain down into the city where I got flirted with at both the Safeway and the Ghiradelli shop. It was pretty neat, so many gay people! I can't wait to go party with some of my other gay friends. I also visited the Palo Alto Ikea to satisfy my new Ikea addiction (at long last netting myself a dining room table).</p>
<p>As far as life in Visalia, it's pretty sweet. I have money now! I can pay for groceries and I don't have to live off my credit card anymore. Every morning, I wake up at around 9 or 10, bring in my New York Times (when they decide to deliver it) and put on my gym shorts and shoes. I go out and run  about 4 miles and come back and do my push-ups and crunches before taking a shower. After that, I read my newspaper over breakfast, which is sometimes eggs and toast, but mostly just my tradition post-run meal of peanut butter sandwiches. After that, I usually run some errands, whatever it is I have to do before work at 2:30.</p>
<p><div class="pic1"><img src="photos/newlife/pic3.jpg" width="300" height="220">
<div class="caption">The Visalia Times-Delta is one of the oldest newspapers in the Valley. Maybe that's why the building looks like it was made in the 19th century.</div>
</div>For dinner, I come home and make any one of the many meals I've become accustomed to making in my kitchen. Mostly tofu. Since I've moved into my own place where I can make as much of a mess as I want, I find I make tofu about 3 times a week. I've got three blocks in the fridge right now! Sometimes I make it with pasta. Sometimes I have it with rice. That's probably my most favorite meal. I make it with rice and veggies (which I can cook together with  my nifty new rice cooker) and it's absolutely delicious.</p>
<p>So yes, I am enjoying my new life. This weekend I'm going out with this guy and Fresno, so chalk another California town to my list. That's probably the only thing that I really miss the most: friends. Though I call a whole heck of a lot of people back home, it would be nice to have people I can hang out with while I'm tooling around in Visalia. I'm sure I'll be assimilating into the area fairly soon.</p>
<p>Well, that's about all I can say about Visalia. I hope you liked my letters. This will be the last one, but if I feel like chiming in with an update before I launch my new Web site next summer, this is probably where I'll do it.</p>
<p>Even though I may be spirited away, you can always find me. I'm pretty easy to track down.</p>
<p>Love you guys. Later.</p>
