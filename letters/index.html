<div class="text">On July 30, 2005, I ended my personal Web site. After leaving, I promised that I would be back, someday.</p>
<p>Sadly, that day is not today. Though I am passively considering my next personal Web site, I remain committed to other priorities in my life. In the interim, since I so miss the opportunity to write and reflect, I have decided to write a few letters filling people in on my movements, all in anticipation of one day perhaps writing a blog again.</p>
<p>I may only post a handful of letters before launching <strong>endlessone.com</strong>. Expect my new full-blown personal Web site several months from now. Until then, enjoy whatever it is I have here.</p>

<div class="list"><a href="firstletter.html">October 23, 2005: The Flight from Athens</a>: I left Athens on July 31, 2005 in a yellow Penske bound for Dayton, Ohio. I was hoping my stay would be short, but it was ultimately 3 months before I was able to stuff all my things into my swollen Grand Prix and set off on my next adventure&#8212;my first job. But before I jet off to sunny California, take a look to see what crazy things I did while bumming around Dayton, Ohio.<br> <strong>Music:</strong> Namie Amuro - Come.

<div class="list"><a href="secondletter.html">October 24, 2005: Goodbye Dayton</a>: On my first day on the road, I said goodbye to my mother and grandmother, got in my car and started barreling down I-70. I drove through Ohio to Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. I marveled at the breathtaking scenery, as forest interior became rolling plains. Before resting today, I am submitting this letter all the way from Colby, Kan., so you can see what happened on the first day.<br>

<div class="list"><a href="thirdletter.html">October 25, 2005: Good Day</a>: With 1,000 miles far behind me, I started out the second day, ready to bridge the next great distance before me. After slinking into Colorado early in the morning, I quickly realized I had underestimated the considerably treacherous mountain ranges of Colorado and Utah. The drive was a real challenge, but once I pulled into my cousin's driveway, I finished my very good day.<br>

<div class="list"><a href="fourthletter.html">October 26, 2005: Planning for Tomorrow</a>: Before I could take the dive and start whatever it was I was starting in California, I stayed with Laura for a day in Las Vegas. Besides preparing a list of apartments to visit when I arrived in Visalia, I spent some quality time with my cousin and had my first experience with gambling. It was wonderful to see my cousin before taking on the last leg of my trip.<br>

<div class="list"><a href="fifthletter.html">October 27, 2005: From Vegas to Visalia</a>: It was definitely the most difficult day for me. Arriving in Visalia shortly before noon, I very nimbly explored the place that I would soon call home. Driving into the Valley was stunning sight and Visalia certainly had it's charms. After finding a place I thought would a perfect fit for me, I retreated to my hotel room&#8212;contemplating my new life in California.<br>

<div class="list"><a href="lastletter.html">December 4, 2005: New Life </a>: It's been about one month since I left Dayton&#8212;four months since I left Athens behind. Things are so different now. I have a real job, my own apartment and I'm very diligently collecting furniture for it. For what will likely be my final letter, learn about what life for me is like&#8212;in California.<br>
