<strong>&quot;Anyone who looks at me knows I am just a rolling stone...&quot; </strong>

<div class="caption">Once I bridged the Mohave Desert past Barstow, Calif., it was on to the plentiful Valley. Before I made it there, though, I had one last mountain range to traverse.</div>
</div>
I woke up this morning leaving Vegas behind. I really didn't want to go, I can't believe that a part of me was really dreading coming to Visalia, but can't help it. At least when I was driving to Vegas I was going  someplace where I would be with someone I knew. Now that I'm here, in California, I feel so lonely.</p>
<p>It's not so bad though. While a part of me shook with dread when I made my way across the Sierra Nevada mountains and the Mojave desert, there was a greater part of me that pressed hard on the gas pedal. I have wanted to do something like this for so long, it's shocking that it's really happening.</p>
<p>Driving out of Vegas was mildly interesting. Watching the casinos dissolve into deserts was something else. Also, if you needed proof that guys in Hootie and the Blowfish's careers were shot, I can confirm that they are playing casinos on the outskirts of Vegas...how lame is that? The casinos dwindled to one&#8212;on the border, and then all of a sudden I was in California. I shed a tear that I would not be traversing any new and different states.  After passing a curious agriculture checkpoint, I was well on my way to Visalia.</p>
<p><div class="pic2"><img src="photos/fromvegastovisalia/pic2.jpg" alt="pic1" name="pic1" width="300" height="225" id="pic7">
<div class="caption">It's not supposed to rain here often, but it was raining when I arrived. I took this picture of the Visalia sign as I was arriving in town. </div>
</div>
In Barstow, Calif., I got off I-15 and started down 58. That kind of slowed me down, it was kind of boring. The Mojave desert was nice, nothing as spectacular as driving through Utah and Colorado, but it kept me awake. Once I got to Bakersfield, I hit 99, which took me right into Tulare County. At this point I was in the Valley, which is very flat and mostly agriculture. As I approached Visalia, I started to see the Sierra Nevada mountains on the horizon&#8212;absolutely beautiful. It's a shame my windshield was covered in bug guts, I couldn't get many good pictures.</p>
<p>Once I got onto 198, which took me right into Visalia, I landed at a Motel 8 to get a room. Once I had that squared away, I was onto my apartment appointment. When I got there, the apartment I wanted was immediately vetoed by the real estate agent.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, you don't want that.&quot; she said. &quot;This one looks good for you,&quot; she said pointing to a 2 bedroom, 1 bath with no washer or dryer that I had listed on my makeshift guide to Visalia living. Apparently any place on the north side is unacceptable&#8212;even if it's only a smidge above 198, the tell-tale dividing line in Visalia.</p>
<p><div class="pic1"><img src="photos/fromvegastovisalia/pic3.jpg" alt="pic1" name="pic1" width="300" height="225" id="pic7">
<div class="caption">Doesn't this apartment complex look nice? I love the look of it. It looks like a wholesome place for me to live. The Spanish roof tiles are also very cool. </div>
</div>
The place she suggested was ok. I instantly thought to myself if I wanted to live at the bare minimum, this would be the place I could do that. The carpet looked like it was laid down in the 70's. Both of the bedrooms were almost identical the room I had in Athens on Highland Park Dr., aka, my seeming prison cell. The kitchen was ok, there was no washer and dryer, like I said. They did have this communal washer and dryer that looked like they were stashed in an outhouse. The good news, though, it only cost about 50 cents to do a load of laundry. Whether or not they worked well, that was another question.</p>
<p>Since not having a washer and dryer was sort of a deal-breaker for me, and I had finished earlier than I thought I would, I decided to head down to Evans Property Management since it was before 3:30. They gave me keys to two places: this one 2 bedroom, 1 bath with everything I was looking for and a loft out in the foothills that was cheap with all utilities paid.</p>
<p>The first place was great! I walked in and I knew it was what I wanted. I took lots of pictures. It was spacious, within my budget and it had a very nice washer and dryer. Also, the area was beautiful. I almost didn't want to go see the loft, but I did anyways. It was near Ivanhoe which, from what I could tell, was some city in the middle of vast fields of orange trees. I couldn't even find the damn place! It was obviously not for me. I was a little worried, though. I got lost in the foothills and was running out of gas.</p>
<p><div class="pic2"><img src="photos/fromvegastovisalia/pic4.jpg" alt="pic1" name="pic1" width="300" height="225" id="pic7">
<div class="caption">Could this be my new kitchen? We'll have to see tomorrow. I can see myself making many-a-Golden Bowl in this place, yes siree.</div>
</div>
I found my way out of the foothills and picked up an application for the first place when I got back to the management office. Now I'm sitting in my hotel room waiting for the pizza guy to come. After a long trip, I deserve some pizza.</p>
<p>I hope they will approve me for the apartment. I think I make just enough money a month for them to accept my application, but I'm not absolutely sure. And how am I going to pay for it? Can't say that I've got a lot of cash lying around for a deposit.</p>
<p>Despite all that, I am just at a loss at this moment. While I was just taking a shower, I sat down in the tub, as the water ran, with my arms crossed around my legs and I smiled to myself and laughed. If you would have told me 3 months ago I would actually have a job and would be moving across the country, I would not have believed you. I thought my dreams were sorts of far-fetched fantasies. I felt like if I was going to survive, I was going to have to settle for less.</p>
<p>Now, as I stand here after driving thousands of miles, alone in a state I've really never known before, I am so humbled and at peace. I prayed for months for this, and it's finally happening. Just knowing I was capable of this is such a surprise. I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, or in the future, but I am happy now. I think I've gone far enough.</p>
<p>For this trip, this is my last letter. I will write again after I'm settled in a month or so.</p>
