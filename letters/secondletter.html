<strong>"<em>...Good bye Nick</em>" &#8212;Dayton</strong>

<div class="caption">Driving through Illinois, I took several pictures of these clouds that were trailing a Noreaster heading to Dayton. They seemed like out stretched pointing back home to Athens.</div>
</div>
I'm sitting in a motel room in Colby, Kansas right now, but I don't believe it. I just drove one thousand miles, but for some reason, it still hasn't sunk in. I don't even know what's going to happen at the end of this week. I don't know why I'm having such a hard time accepting that my ambitious move to California is a reality.</p>
<p>When I left my Grandma's apartment, it was hard saying goodbye to Mom. I didn't want to come to Dayton, but she made it so much like home for me. I had forgotten what it was like to live with her. I haven't really lived with her since I moved to Athens 4 years ago. Also, I never really got to know her since she went to Ridgeview. She's so much more of a person now and she's happy. It's nice to get close to that again. Even if it was only for a precious handful of months.</p>
<p>Also, I am really thankful for what my Grandmother did for me. She put me up in her place for three months and she paid for so many gallons of milk, bags of Soy Chips and boxes of veggie burgers, fake chicken and veggie corn dogs. If it wasn't for her, I don't know what I would have done in August. I shutter to think that I could still be in Athens.</p>

<div class="caption">I'm not sure why I had such a perverse fascination for these bridges, but I took a snapshot of them every time I passed. At this point, I'm approaching Kansas City.</div>
</div>
<p>I took a lot of pictures today. It's very hard taking photos while driving briskly by at 60 miles an hour. I got a few good photos. I thought the clouds rolling across Illinois were so beautiful. It was like finger outstretched, pointed back home, to the South. Like God was reminding me where I came from.</p>
<p>For food, I didn't eat much. I stopped at Bob Evans, but I kind of wanted to go to Denny's. I know, Denny's is slightly more trashy than Bob Evans, but it's different, you know? It's not all bad. I've had so many plates of Bob Evans French toast the last few months, so I have to admit breakfast this morning was kind of boring. I read the newspaper, so that made up for it. I had Pizza Hut for lunch to my chagrin. I would have gotten something else, but the car was thirsty, so we had to compromise for this TS complex outside of Kansas City where all they had was a Pizza Hut and a Subway. I guess I could have gotten a sub, but my nearly-a-year-stint of vegetarianism has yet the afford me the ability to want anything else at Subway besides a meatball sub.</p>

<div class="caption">The good thing about driving West is, though you may never see the sunrise, you're always bound to see a fabulous sunset. I know Kansas is probably the most boring state to drive though, but you can't beat this scene.</div>
</div>
<p>I broke down and bought a car charger for my iPod. I don't know why I didn't do it sooner. It integrated so well into my car. My iPod is just right above my head and the charger has an extra slot for the FM transmitter, so now it fits right in the top compartment (which seems to be closer to the antenna). I didn't have any interference whatsoever! I hope that keeps up, I absolutely hate it when that damn transmitter starts crackling up.</p>
<p>Mom told me that she heard Kansas was boring, but I didn't think so. It's certainly <em>very</em> long, but the landscape was beautiful. The rolling plains were breathtaking. I also saw oil pumps, which was kind of odd. I wasn't able to get a good picture of them, sadly. I watched the sun set on the horizon. That was stunning. One of the many perks of driving West. Also, I guess it helped me to know I was going in the right direction.</p>
<p>That's enough for tonight. I should really be sleeping. Many mountains to traverse.</p>
<p>Adios.</p>
