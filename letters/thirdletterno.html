<strong>You Don't Want to Hear About My Good Day...</strong>
<p><div class="pic1"><img src="photos/goodday/pic1.jpg" alt="pic1" name="pic1" width="300" height="225" id="pic7">
<div class="caption">Waking up before dawn in Colby, Kan., I got to watch the sun rise in my rearview mirror. I have to admit, kind of an interesting juxtaposition.</div>
</div>
It's been a long day. I woke up from my suspended animation in Colby feeling like the drive might be a little less strenuous as yesterday's. Denver was a mere 200 miles away, Utah was about 200 miles after, and the many rolling miles of the desert would certainly be easy to race through. Oh, if only I hadn't underestimated Colorado...</p>
<p>Despite that, today has by far been the most beautiful day. Yesterday, as I moved from Indiana to Kansas, I saw the landscape change from forest interior to rolling plains. That was exciting. Today, I watched the plains become mountains, the mountains become plateaus, and the grasses become deserts. It was just stunning how a mere stretch of 5 miles seems to separate two completely different worlds (or climate zones, as that description is less figurative and more accurate). I had to stop twice to take pictures. I felt the scenery was worth more than just taking snap shots with one hand through my bug splattered windshield.</p>
<p>I wanted to stop in at the hotel for breakfast, but I'd have to wait 20 minutes early, so I got moving. It took a little over two hours to get to Denver. I thought I was a lot closer when I stopped last night, if I had known I was 200 miles away (and I should have known because a recent college graduate should know how to add), I would have  tried to land at another few towns over. Anyways, when I got to Denver, I really wanted to eat, but their exit signs lacked any lists of appropriate dining establishments. That was annoying, I didn't want to roam the streets of downtown Denver looking for an IHOP, so I kept going.</p>

<div class="caption">While I was driving <em>very carefully</em> through this beautiful mountain range near Vail, Colo., I had to stop  at a scenic point and take a few pictures. Absolutely breathtaking...</div>
</div>
Right outside of Denver you start going into the Rocky Mountains. That was a lot more difficult then I thought it would be. I mean, if I have to go up a steep hill on a bike, it's like complete hell, I'm not sure why I didn't imagine a similar situation for my car (especially considering I was driving up the side of a mountain). The Prix was very adamant about taking the up grade slowly so I had to floor it as I was in the way of a lot of other experienced Colorado drivers. It was really stressful, I hated going up hill. I was afraid my car might overheat.</p>
<p>But that's not the worst part! Going downhill was like riding a stagecoach into a deep gulch like out of one of those old western movies. Well, maybe not that bad, but since my car was so packed, it gave me a lot more momentum and made the car a lot harder to control. I had to be very careful that I didn't fly off the mountain when I raced into a turn. After a while, though, the turns and down grades got less severe and I was able to make it to the other side, no sweat.</p>
<p>On the way I passed Vail and the Aspen area. Lucky for me snow hadn't fallen much. I got out and took some pictures of the Vail area, it was so beautiful. There was snow on the mountain peaks and I even saw some geysers (but I didn't get a good picture of them). When I left the peaks of the mountains, I entered a more arid region of Colorado that lead into Utah. The desert was beautiful. After I got lunch at Grand Junction, it would be about 2 hours before I saw any other signs of life other than my fellow highway comrades.</p>

<div class="caption">When I cleared the mountains and I was heading down toward Utah, I noticed this beautiful scene in the sky. I was so lucky to be blessed with such good weather! </div>
</div>
I was able to pass this area pretty easily. I went by a place called Eagle Canyon, and after I passed a few scenic areas in lieu of getting to Vegas earlier, I finally caved when I saw a stunning cloud formation coming up over the mountains. I had called my cousin earlier and she said that she was getting rain. I figured I was seeing the same system that was affecting her. As I drove farther, eventually I was under it, drenched by the same rain that was affecting my cousin hours earlier. Geography can be so cool sometimes.
<p>After I got to Interstate 15, the trip seemed to go a lot quicker. I was only 2 hours from Vegas and I wanted to get there as quick as I could. The rain finally stopped, the sun set and in no time I noticed I was only about 10 miles from Vegas. It was then, like a midnight sunrise, the city appeared on the horizon. It was like the desert was embroidered in lights, it was so amazing! I knew the city was bright, but it seemed like ever neighborhood street and store parking lot was lit like the Vegas Strip. Going about 50 miles per hour and pissing a lot of drivers off, I tried my best to get a picture of the sight.</p>

<div class="caption">After Grand Junction, Colo., there was a stretch of about 180 miles where there was no civilization whatsoever. I stopped at a scenic point to get this gorgeous shot of Eagle Canyon in Utah. </div>
</div>
I landed at Laura's place at last and we headed out to the Star Trek Experience to ride the Borg ride (I know, first thing I do, I'm such a nerd). It was closed until 11 a.m., so we had small dinner there instead. It was so expensive! I would have liked to get a burger or something (veggie, of course), but that was like $15! What a gyp! I got a $7 appetizer of onion rings instead and called it dinner.</p>
<p>Laura's boyfriend Nick was there with her and we had a fun conversation. I told them about how Leena's friend Suresh described a woman receiving oral sex as "getting face," and that really seemed to entertain them. I don't know how we got on that topic, blame it on my exhausting, I suppose. We went home, I hopped into bed and that's the end of my good day.</p>
<p>Another thousand miles, if you can believe it. I'm happy I'm here with Laura, but I'm really scared about going into Visalia the day after tomorrow. Unlike Vegas, it's not like I have family greeting me. Also, I have no place to stay. Finding a place to live is going to be so stressful. I'm going to make some phone calls in the morning so hopefully I'll find something. I might also try my hand at a little gambling too.</p>
<p>I'm exhausted once again. Until tomorrow...</p>
