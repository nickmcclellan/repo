<strong>Dayton, Ohio &#8212; the armpit of America</strong>

<div class="caption">Oddly, I beefed up on my lunar phase knowledge during my stint as an Ohioan. Did you know you can tell where the sun is in relation to Earth based on the way the light shines on the Moon? Well, I'm convinced that is true!</div>
</div>
It has been a while since I've done this. At first, when I arrived in Ohio, I ached to keep writing. I almost resolved to write a personal blog each night, though probably never proliferating it. Sadly though, as the time drifted by, that ache lessened and the sort of listless misery that pervades Dayton soon became a comfort and all that didn't seem important anymore.
<p>I may have mentioned somewhere that the thought of going to Dayton, Ohio, was about as appealing as having nails driven through each one of my toes. I shouldn't have to say that I was not sublimely happy when I arrived. I was glad to leave Athens, though. I lived there for four years and the time had come to leave. I was so happy to be someplace different, but not necessarily thrilled about living with my mother again. I mean, if you can believe it, my mother lives with <em>her mother</em>, so you can see how my situation was especially pitiful.</p>
<p>The first thing I did when I arrived (after sleeping for almost twelve hours and throwing all my things into storage) was finish my web site. You might be surprised how freeing that was. Completing that effort was like dropping a ton of baggage. It took me a few weeks to get together everything I had intended, but when I had finished, it was everything I envisioned it would be. The sucky thing was, after I finished it, my computer crashed. Crap.</p>

<div class="caption">After an eventful day complete with a 1.6 mile walk down by the Germantown dam, Joey is all kinds of pooped, curled up in the pillows on my bed. Isn't he just the most adorable dog?</div>
</div>
<p>That was a headache. I had just reformatted the hard drive at the behest of some stupid Dell Representative I spoke to before leaving Athens who was convinced I had a virus. After replacing the mp3's I removed from the computer before the reformat (<em>cutting</em> them from my iPod instead of safely copying them), I suddenly lost functionality and was told I needed to replace the hard drive. The prospect of replacing my mp3's was sickening (though I had thankfully backed most of them up a year earlier). I wasted about two week messing with that, but to make a long story short, I was able to recover all my mp3's eventually and even add several new ones :-)</p>
<p>It was pretty boring the first month. I think the most fun I had in those early days was the one night a week I would get the energy to head down to Steak N' Shake to get a milkshake and fries with the dog. I'm sorry to admit, but Joey (my mom's schnauzer) was my best friend in Ohio. Oh, Jeremy was fabulous, you can't discount that, but it's not like he would worship the ground I walked on or wait on pins and needles for me to return home. Every morning, before I did anything, Joey expected me to take him outside to throw the ball and go for a run. I loved indulging that dog and all his innocent childish leanings. I was definitely a dog person in Ohio.</p>

<div class="caption">Joey on one of his more photogenic days. You can see Grandma if you look hard enough. This is her perch were she watches all her justice shows and smokes her cigarettes. I spent the least amount of time in <em>this</em> room.</div>
</div>
<p>I had a dog growing up, her name was Brandy. To be honest, though, she never really liked me. I mean, she preferred me to a stranger, but compared to the rest of my family, I was trash. That wasn't the case with Joey. I took him out sometimes four times a day throwing his ball and running around, and he just loved me for it. He eventually started giving my mother and grandmother a cold shoulder and lavishing me with all his affection. That really pissed them off, let me tell you. I wish I could have taken Joey with me. He was such a well behaved, good dog.</p>
<p>I have to give JJ a lot of credit (that's Jeremy's nickname over at the Kettering Foundation). Along with my mother, he really kicked my ass to start producing resumes again. While I would try my best the be optimistic and take chances, Jeremy was always there to offer the sobering reality of my dismal financial situation and not-so-promising job outlook. At one point, I even applied for a serving job in Dayton. I didn't want to be the guy who graduated from college just to wind up serving at the Italian restaurant in downtown Dayton, but Jeremy helped me to accept that possibility. </p>
<p>I helped Jerm set up his posh Ikea furnished apartment in the Oregon District of Dayton. Together we joined the YMCA and I pushed myself back up to my UGA personal best on the bench press. I even got myself out running every now and again. Jerm and I also ventured out on the town a few times. Gotta love those Dayton crack heads chasing us down dark alleys trying to sell us God knows what. I never really found my niche at the Dayton bars, but I did wind up meeting someone special.</p>
<div class="pic2"><img src="photos/flightfromathens/pic4.jpg" alt="pic4" name="pic4" width="300" height="225" id="pic4">
<div class="caption">This is some building in Oxford where one night Brandon and I did some stargazing. Also, on another pleasant evening, we went on a nice nature walk. I saw so many deer in Oxford :-)</div>
</div>
<p>His name is Brandon and he goes to Miami University, which was about 45 minutes away from Miamisburg. Our interests click real well. He is into some interesting movies. He showed me "Dead Poets Society" and "Best in Show". I showed him "Kill Bill Vol. 1", but I never got to watch Vol. 2 with him. Funny little side note, but while I was on my way out of Athens, I developed an unhealthy fascination with that film. I just love it!</p>
<p>We have been dating only a handful of weeks up to now. Just yesterday we got back from Columbus seeing his favorite band, The Dresden Dolls. The describe themselves as a sort of punk cabaret, and it was one of the best concerts I've ever seen! I fell in love with a lot of their songs, especially "Truce" and "Good Day." Brandon even got to meet Amanda Palmer, the lead singer, and he got a picture with her! His hands were shaking while he let down his things so I took the picture for him. We had a nice time. It's just a shame I have to leave.</p>
<p>Yup, while I didn't seem to find my lifeline out of Athens in the nick of time, I eventually found it in Dayton. For the past 3 months, I've checked JournalismJobs.com and the ACES listserv about every day. I'd usually see one to two listings that seemed promising. If I learned on thing this summer it was that I was that in most cases, I was not the most desirable candidate for a job. Don't get me wrong, I have a great deal of qualification, but the majority of newspapers looking for copy editors want someone that already has 1 to 2 years daily copy editing experience. I used what I learned in Athens and I would answer the ads stating that they would consider resumes from recent college grads. Thanks to this, I was able to snag at least a decent look over from more employers.</p>
<div class="pic1"><img src="photos/flightfromathens/pic5.jpg" alt="pic5" name="pic5" width="300" height="225" id="pic5">
<div class="caption">I got to know many of the rural roads like the one above which cris cross Ohio. Sadly, when I was in Visalia, I missed the leaves turning. Fortunately, they hadn't fallen to the ground, so there was still plenty of autumn to see.</div>
</div>
<p>One paper in Washington D.C. e-mailed me about a proofreading position, wanting to interview me over the phone, and I very studiously responded. Never heard anything back. I can't begin to tell you how annoying situations like that were (they e-mailed <em>me</em> requesting a phone interview!) I got a few responses from papers I had contacted back in Athens. I always appreciated an explanation along with my NO. I interviewed one week with two Gannett papers: The Visalia Times-Delta in California and the Newark Advocate in Ohio. I felt I bombed the California interview but improved significantly with Newark. I didn't want to stay in Ohio, but at that point, I was willing to take anything.  I just wanted to start making money and get the heck out of my grandmother's apartment. Funny how things work, sometimes: Newark never called me back. Visalia did and wanted me to fly me out for an interview.</p>
<p>I knew this was an amazing opportunity. Gannett is the largest newspaper company in the nation in terms of circulation and California was at the top of my list of places I wanted to move to. I felt like I had floundered so far in my interviews. I wanted to do everything I could to prepare. I talked to Fink, Martin, Jerm, Padmini, John Lynch, my mother&#8212;everyone. I got my suit cleaned, my mom got me some nice new shoes, and I studied tirelessly for the editing test that was certain to come up. If I was going to bomb this interview, I wanted it to be because I was not qualified, not because I wasn't prepared. </p>

<div class="caption">Another beautiful day in Oxford, Oh. I am not sure why I took a picture of what appears to be a hippo's butt in the local park. Even more pressing, why did the city planners in Oxford put a hippo's butt in their park?</div>
</div>
<p>On October 10th, I flew from Dayton to Dallas, where I caught a flight to Fresno. I took an hour shuttle to Visalia and was dropped off in front of the paper. I met the Presentation editor and got to know the newspaper staff. I asked a lot of questions and shared some criticism. After some dinner, I went to my hotel room to prepare for the next day and get some sleep. My interview with the Executive Editor couldn't have been better. I actually asked her more questions than she had for me! I impressed the News Editor when I admitted my favorite band was Garbage. I felt I struggled with the editing test, but I did catch a few tricky things. I left at the end of the day feeling confident I had done my best. The next day, I flew home to Dayton. When I arrived, on my way out to the gym with Jerm, I noticed I had a job offer waiting in my Inbox.</p>
<p>I accepted the job Monday. Tomorrow I am beginning the drive out to California.</p>
<p>My car is packed. I'm almost broke, but I have plenty of credit to get me started. I am excited, scared&#8212;you know the drill. I'm so happy I finally got a job. I looked forward to the feeling all summer. I mentioned once, in my last Blog, that I felt my dream of getting a job and being on my own was a fantasy. Now that I have obtained what I worked so hard to achieve, I just can't believe it. I'm going to be hundreds of miles from here in just a matter of days&#8212;hours even. I'm leaving everything I've ever known behind and I don't know when I will be back again.</p>
<div class="pic1"><img src="photos/flightfromathens/pic7.jpg" alt="pic6" name="pic7" width="300" height="225" id="pic7">
<div class="caption">The weather in Dayton was not very exciting in the waning summer and beauteous autumn. However, every now and again, you'd see a cloud like this in the sky.</div>
</div>
<p>I had an awesome time here. Being with Mom again was something I really needed. Her persistent love and support has kept me going where I felt others had let me down. I'm going to miss going out to lunch with her at Hooters, sitting down at the lake with her and Mike eating veggie dogs and, of course, lecturing her on why she needs to reformat her hard drive. I am going to especially miss my friend Jeremy. He's done so much for me, I wish I could be his Dayton buddy, going on about various Ohio oddities while frequenting the Y. I guess it's just not meant to be.</p>
<p>In the end, my flight from Athens was not as dire as I thought after all. I thought it was a retreat, but it was renewal. I feel very blessed that I got a job. I feel like my prayers have finally been answered.</p>
<p>And all it took was a trip to Dayton, the armpit of America. Ha ha, just kidding. It's really not that bad here. It's beautiful. </p>
<p>I have miles to go before I sleep, so I had better get some sleep while I can. I will a handful of letters about my trip until I arrive in Visalia. After that, I might write again once more before I finally decide on what to do for the new Web site.</p>
<p>Thank you friends, and I will see you soon...</p>
