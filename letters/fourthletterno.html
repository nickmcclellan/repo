<strong>You always lose something is Las Vegas. </strong>

If there's one thing that I feel I've missed the most after four years of college, it's family. So many things have changed since I've gone to UGA. My parents divorced. My mom fled the state to move and moved to Ohio. I cut off ties to my manipulating father. My aunt and uncle divorced. My uncle died.</p>
<p>In all that drama, while our family was falling apart, Laura and I have always stood by each other. My cousin has always been a close friend of mine. Both of us are about the same age. We've both had to live with parents that bullied and pushed us around. We both graduated college with no trodden path to follow. I feel like I identify with Laura most out of my whole family because I feel like she knows where I'm coming from. She knows, because we've both been there.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning in my grandfather's condo, which my aunt owns, but is currently occupied by my cousin who's looking for work on the West Coast. Nick, her boyfriend, left for his flight this morning while I was still sleeping. I woke up pretty early and called a few apartments in Visalia to set up some possible visitations tomorrow. When my cousin got back from taking him to the airport, the two of us left to get some breakfast.</p>

<div class="caption">Star Trek: The Experience is probably the only interesting thing to do at the Hilton (besides Paris Hilton). It's too bad they're both over-priced</div>
</div>
We went to a nifty little diner close to her place, somewhere near Summerlin. We talked about a lot of things. We talked about the family and graduation. We talked about life and why we were out as far as we were. I feel like the two of us understand that, since we've graduated, we want to grow beyond the pots we were planted in. We're looking for work so far from home because we want to see how well we can survive. I was really lucky to share this time with my cousin. I only wish I didn't have to leave tomorrow.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day, Laura accompanied me to the Las Vegas Hilton to try out the Star Trek Experience ride. You wouldn't believe it, but, when we got up there to pay for the ride, it turned out that tickets were $40 a piece! Not only did they make us pay for the Borg ride, which we wanted to do, but we had to pay for the boring Klingon ride and the stupid museum. I'm shocked to admit this, but while I really wanted to ride the stupid Star Trek ride, I wasn't going to pay that much to do it. So we left.</p>
<p>Instead of spending $80 on a thrilling but expensive Star Trek experience, I decided to let the casinos rape the money out of me instead. Oh, no, not <em>that</em> kind of rape. No, I'm referring the gambling, which is tantamount to rape, as far as I'm concerned. So you put a $20 bill in the machine and you make your bet. The slot machine does its thing and all of a sudden, bells and whistles go off and you've won! I got 20 credits! One thing though: I bet 40. Why would you get bells and whistles when you're not even winning, you're just losing slower than you would if you hadn't matched anything on the machine at all? I did not like gambling. I did not like it one bit.</p>

<div class="caption">Apologies for the crappy picture, but night shots are difficult for a mediocre photographer like myself. Honestly, I prefer to view Las Vegas from a distance. </div>
</div>
We went back to Laura's after I parted with my precious $80. I took a nap&#8212;you could imagine I was exhausted. After I woke up Laura and I worked on a few things with her resume and cover letter, then we got some pizza. When we got back, I braved searching through my car for the DVDs I packed months earlier in Athens so I could watch <em>Amelie</em> with her for the first time. I think she liked it, but like most dubbed films, it was hard for a first-timer to follow. It was good to hear Yann Tiersen again.</p>
<p>I have an appointment with a management company in Visalia tomorrow. There's also this apartment that sounds pretty interesting, I'll probably check it out if I get to the office before 3:30 tomorrow. I'm really nervous now. When I go to Visalia, I'll have no one. I will be on my own. At this moment, I don't think I can handle it.</p>
<p>Well, whether I'm ready or not, I'm going to go anyways. 6 hours drive tomorrow. Wish me luck. </p>
