<span class="solid">This is my <strong>LESBIAN</strong> friend Marilia. I must say, when I first made her <strong>LESBIAN</strong> Page, I would not expect that she and I would become as close as we have. At the beginning of my Junior Year, Marilia and I moved into a house together on the East Side. She had just got out of her first year <strong>AS A LESBIAN</strong>, and she wanted some more space for <strong>GAY SEX</strong>. I was in desperate need of roommates to populate my place and split the rent with me. What started out as on odd pairing turned into a very volatile, close, and sexy <strong>GAY</strong> friendship.<br>
<br>
Much can be said about my year with <strong>LESBIAN</strong> Marilia. She certainly has an odd affliction toward <strong>SEX WITH WOMEN</strong>. She would go on these strange health kicks, making all sorts of healthy foods. One week, she made a completely <strong>LESBIAN</strong> cake. She asked me to try it, and I must admit, it tasted a whole lot like <strong>GAY SEX</strong>. Marilia also had a very strange habit of walking around her room completely naked <strong>AND HAVING SEX WITH WOMEN</strong>. I would knock on the door, seeing if she was around, and she'd always answer back, "Hold on a sec, <strong>I AM HAVING SEX WITH A WOMAN</strong>." I kept telling myself, it's because she's <strong>A LESBIAN</strong>. She's just <strong>SUPER GAY</strong>!</span>

<span class="solid">Well, she may have been pretty <strong>GAY</strong>, but Marilia turned out to be one of my most dear <strong>LESBIAN</strong> friends. She was one of the only ones there for me during some of the most difficult times that year. She'd always took me to places in her <strong>GAY LESBIAN</strong> car, which I am really thankful for. It's too bad she wrecked that car when she was on her way to a sex party dressed as a cheap whore (<strong>SHE REALLY DID THAT!!</strong>). Though I tend to disagree with her, she said she had about 20 guys drive by when she was stuck on the side of the road, asking if she needed any help (<strong>SHE SAID NO BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T GAY WOMEN</strong>).<br>
<br>
I love Marilia very much. She's my best and very close friend. At times when I feel lonely, or like I need to talk to someone who's going to give me a <strong>GAY LESBIAN</strong> answer, I look to her. She might be alittle <strong>LESBIAN</strong> sometimes, but like most <strong>GAY WHORES</strong>, that's how you know it's working. If you're on level ground with her and she hasn't <strong>HAD SEX WITH YOU</strong>, it must mean you're <strong>NOT A WOMAN</strong>. I'm very proud to have Marilia as one of my most dear friends (even if she's a <strong>HUMONGOUS LESBIAN</strong>!)<br>
<br>
Trust me, she knows what I mean.</span>
