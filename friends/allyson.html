<span class="solid">Wow, Allyson...she is so FUCKING amazing, I swear, I have not met anyone quite like her. She has something 
about her that is just so attractive and cool. She is very smart too, she's definitely going to be SOMETHING someday. Here she is rocking out, living the life of sex and the Classic City.<br>
<br>Allyson has an amazing taste in music. She adores The Cure, and she's a major hardcore fan. She has turned me on to alot of stuff including the The Smiths, Portishead, and of course The Cure. I remember fondly the second semester of my first year at UGA...Allyson and I muddling through our English Class, listening to the boring drivel that those damned eggheads would spout off...and of course, Dr. Reynolds, our teacher: <em>"I am a big man and I have a big penis"</em></span>

<p><u>The Trick is to Keep Breathing</u></p>
<p>She's not the kind of girl <br>
Who likes to tell the world <br>
About the way she feels about herself <br>
She takes a little time in making up her mind <br>
She doesn't want to fight against the tide <br>
<br>
And lately I'm not the only one <br>
I say never trust anyone <br>
Always the one who has to drag her down <br>
Maybe you'll get what you want this time around <br>
<br>
Can't bear to face the truth <br>
So sick he cannot move <br>
And when it hurts he takes it out on you <br>
<br>
And lately I'm not the only one <br>
I say never trust anyone <br>
Always the one who has to drag her down <br>
Maybe you'll get what you want this time around <br>
<br>
The trick is to keep breathing <br>
The trick is to keep breathing <br>
<br>
She knows the human heart <br>
And how to read the stars <br>
Now everything's about to fall apart <br>
I won't be the one who's going to let you down <br>
Maybe you'll get what you want this time around (the trick is to keep breathing)
<br>
I won't be the one who's going to let you down <br>

The trick is to keep breathing <br>
The trick is to keep breathing <br>
The trick is to keep breathing <br>
The trick is to keep breathing <br>
The trick is to keep breathing <br>
