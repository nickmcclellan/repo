<span class="solid">This is my friend Dille. We've been friends since we were wee little freshman. I met her one fateful night at Tasty World. She was sippin' on a Smirnoff Ice and I thought she was such a bad ass doing it too. But she was so cool, God, was she cool.<br>
<br>
Did you know Dille along with a certain special someone else are the only persons to share a Friends Page on my website? Well, it's true. They even got the bestest garbage song ever, "Stupid Girl." Well, I just point it out to warn you of the hotness that is Dille. You gotta keep your eye on her (I know of several hombres y señoritas doing just that).<br>
<br>
There are many memories I have involving the two of us. There are of course the good ol' days back in 2001 when me and Missy used to come to O-house to see Dille and Leena. There was also that time at Boneshakers when I was sitting next to Dille and that crazy drag queen started to heckle us (mostly me) for ignoring her performance. That was scary. Oh, and then there was also that time when I ran into her outside Mary Lyndon during a fire drill. It always seemed like I was running into Dille, even on the sides of roads even!<br>
<br>
Well, it may have taken me a while to get a picture of her, but that doesn't mean she isn't special. Dille is awesome and I hope this little tribute will make her half as happy as she has made me by just being sweet to me these past four years. You rock girl!</span>
