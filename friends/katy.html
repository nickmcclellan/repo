<span class="solid">This is my friend Katy. Yup, we've been cool since the days back in P-town (you know, Powder Springs??) where we went to high school, and all that. I had lots of classes with Katy. I figure this came about because we were both just so smart and attractive, they had to bunch us all together.<br>
<br>
I mean, we had Spanish. I believe that's when I got to know Katy best. She was so smart and...multi-lingual. After that, there was that pesky little math class we had. Analysis. I mean, why would you call it Analysis? Well, we had fun balking at all the annoying egghead Juniors who thought they were so smart&#8212;but we showed them, didn't we Katy!</span>

<span class="solid">Katy's always been writing. She's a skilled poet, and she has a good heart, and she cares very deeply for her friends. I don't think anyone can beat that. Fun Katy memories: Talkin' about Buffy, riding around Marietta square with that guy who I...well, I don't remember his name, I had just met him :-/ Also, getting the money for the limo for our Senior Prom! That turned out to be quite the ordeal, but it all worked out in the end. We had alot of fun at Scalini's that night, with all the talking up. Definitely need to revist that place real soon.<br>
<br>
I miss Katy a bunch, and hope that some day soon we'll both be in Marietta at the same time (so we can get lunch, or something, right??)</span>

<p><u>Temptation Waits</u></p>
<p>I'll tell you something <br>
I am a wolf but <br>
I like to wear sheep's clothing <br>
<br>
I am a bonfire <br>
I am a vampire <br>
I'm waiting for my moment <br>
<br>
You come on like a drug <br>
I just can't get enough <br>
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more <br>
And there's so much at stake <br>
I can't afford to waste <br>
I never needed anybody like this before <br>
<br>
I'll tell you something <br>
I am a demon <br>
Some say my biggest weakness <br>
I have my reasons <br>
Call it my defense <br>
Be careful what you're wishing <br>
<br>
You come on like a drug <br>
I just can't get enough <br>
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more <br>
And there's so much at stake <br>
I can't afford to waste <br>
I never needed anybody like this before <br>
<br>
You are a secret <br>
A new possession <br>
I like to keep you guessing <br>
<br>
You come on like a drug <br>
I just can't get enough <br>
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more <br>
And there's so much at stake <br>
I can't afford to waste <br>
I never needed anybody like this before <br>
