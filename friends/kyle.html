<span class="solid">I remember the first day I met Kyle. We had been exchanging e-mails about him coming in to volunteer with Lambda and the Resource Office. I was sitting at the desk when this handsome blonde fellow walks in the door and introduces himself. I always thought of my volunteers as new friends and not just volunteers, but I had no idea that Kyle would become one of my kindest and dearest friends. He really is someone special.<br>
<br>
If there's one thing I can say about Kyle, it would be that he's one super Democrat! I mean, I feel alittle blue every election day, but this guys has got a blue on the brain 365 days a year! He even founded his own GLBT Democrat organization at UGA, the Stonewall Students (which was even featured in <em>The Advocate</em>). He has so much drive and ambition, it makes me naucious. I know Kyle can handle it, though. He's fucking hardcore!</span>

<span class="solid">I have had so much fun with Kyle of the last two years. He's a staple at Boneshakers and he makes going to that hole-in-the-wall worth it. He's also alot of fun at parties and he mixes the best drinks. He's also a snappy dresser, cigar afficionado, and an all around great guy. I mean, there's not much you can harp on this guy for, he's just too good (unless you count his addiction to Aqua Linda, but who can resist a good burrito??)<br>
<br>
The sad thing about leaving Georgia is saying good-bye to friends like Kyle. On the upside, I do look forward to coming down for every Atlanta Pride and partying with him in his stylish Midtown apartment. At least, with a fabulous friend like Kyle, I know where the party's at.</span>

<p><u>Queer</u></p>
<p>Hey boy, take a look at me
<br>Let me dirty up your mind
<br>I'll strip away your hard veneer
<br>And see what I can find
<br>
<br>The queerest of the queer
<br>The strangest of the strange
<br>The coldest of the cool
<br>The lamest of the lame
<br>The numbest of the dumb
<br>I hate to see you here
<br>You choke behind a smile
<br>A fake behind the fear
<br>The queerest of the queer
<br>
<br>This is what he pays me for
<br>I'll show you how it's done
<br>You learn to love the pain you feel
<br>Like father like son
<br>
<br>The queerest of the queer
<br>Hide inside your head
<br>The blindest of the blind
<br>The deadest of the dead
<br>You're hungry cause you starve
<br>While holding back the tears
<br>Choking on your smile
<br>A fake behind the fear
<br>The queerest of the queer
<br>
<br>I know what's good for you (You can touch me if you want)
<br>I know you're dying to (You can touch me if you want)
<br>I know what's good for you (You can touch me if you want)
<br>But you can't stop
<br>
<br>The queerest of the queer
<br>The strangest of the strange
<br>The coldest of the cool
<br>The lamest of the lame
<br>The numbest of the dumb
<br>I hate to see you here
<br>You choke behind a smile
<br>A fake behind the fear
<br>The queerest of the queer
<br>The strangest of the strange
<br>The coldest of the cool
<br>You're nothing special here
<br>A fake behind the fear
<br>The queerest of the queer
<br>
<br>I know what's good for you
<br>I know you're dying to
<br>I know what's good for you
<br>I bet you're dying to
<br>You can touch me if you want
<br>You can touch me if you want
<br>You can touch me
<br>You can touch me
<br>But you can't stop</span>
