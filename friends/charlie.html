<span class="solid">Charlie has been a friend of mine for about a year now it seems. I remember meeting him at Lambda in the spring or fall, I'm not quite sure I remember. I don't think I saw him that much though, I was all recluse when it came to Lambda. I became a much better friend to Charlie in the fall of 2002. I became a bit more brave when it came to Lambda then and talked to him much more. Charlie is actually a staple of Wednesday nights at Boneshakers. I always seem to see him there and he is such a joy to dance with. Charlie and the Pad actually had this strange bet last fall over which of the two were mentioned more in my Internet Journal. I think Padmini was mentioned more at the time though...not to say that Charlie is any less amazing, of course. They both equally rock my world. Charlie is an amazing guy and very sweet. He's certainly one of the nicest people I know.</span>

<span class="solid">Look! Charlie is all famous cause he's rubbing elbows with Mo Rocca! Yah, he's rubbing more then elbows ;-D At this point, I must warn you that it's probably necessary that you go to <a href="thepad.html">The Pad's Page</a> so you can judge which of the pages is better. Sure, the Pad is dead sexy and popular, but who can compete with Charlie's dance fucking abilities?! I can't make this decision!</span>

<span class="solid">Charlie's garbage song is very unique...during the Thanksgiving potluck, Charlie came running into the house with a bowl of mashed potatoes dancing to the Rocky theme...Rocky was a pugilist..."Begging Bone" has a lyric about a pugilist...sigh, I'm running out of garbage songs...</p>
<p><u>Begging Bone</u></p>
<p>You're just like a dog<br>
With your begging bone<br>
You're always chasing psychos<br>
Down those rabbit holes<br>
You like them the best<br>
Cause they are dangerous<br>
And they get off on you<br>
And your subservience<br> 
<br>
What can I do?<br>
Can't make a monkey out of you<br>
I can't keep you on a leash<br>
Can't lock you in your room<br>
I can't make you perfectly<br>
Suspicious of the world<br>
Can't teach you lessons<br>
That you never want to learn<br> 
<br>
You started to believe<br>
That you're completely unlovable<br>
Which makes us want to laugh<br>
Cause you're adorable<br>
You say you've been depressed<br>
But no doubt you'll get over it<br>
And get back on your feet<br>
Just like a pugilist<br> 
<br>
What can I do?<br>
Can't make a monkey out of you<br>
I can't keep you on a leash<br>
Can't lock you in your room<br>
I can't make you perfectly<br>
Suspicious of the world<br>
Can't teach you lessons<br>
That you never want to learn<br> 
<br>
It's ok to be afraid<br>
Of what's inside another mind<br>
An invitation to discover<br>
And explore the other side<br>
It's ok to be afraid<br>
Of finding out you really care<br>
Like a hammer crashing down<br>
Between the clouds out of the air<br> 
<br>
Pray that they come through<br>
Of course they never do<br> 
<br>
Of course they never do<br>
Of course they never do<br>
Of course they never do<br>
Of course they never do<br></span>
