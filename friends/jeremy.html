<span class="solid">This is my friend Jeremy. We weren't always friends. Yup, apparently, during our freshman year, we had a sort of falling out before we actually fell on, but everything has been awesome since then.<br>
<br>
He's always going somewhere, it never fails. Who knows how many times he's been to Russia, but he's also been to Cuba, Sicily, Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. (Ok, so he never went there, but I told him he should go...or at least it will be the continent I will beat him to).<br>
<br>
Jeremy is definitely among the smartest people I know. He also gets around! Oh yeah, you know what I mean! Jeremy knows EVERYONE, much like John. It seems that every time I meet someone, they have some strange connection to Jeremy. Also, Jeremy does know how to have fun! It's always nice to hang out with Jeremy and a nice bottle of Vodka (or a Chocolate Martini). Jeremy is also a very enjoyable person to share lunch with. Ah, what else...yes, Jeremy is also one with whom I have shared many interesting IM conversations. Here's <a href="../journal/spring03/2-16joex2001.htm" target="_blank">one</a> you can enjoy as well. Ah, yes, and one with whom I can gossip and share drama. Ah...the joys of having gay friends...Jeremy is certainly one my most favorites. :-)</span>

<p><u>Androgyny</u></p>
<p>When everything is going wrong<br>
And you can't see the point of going on<br>
Nothing in life is set in stone <br>
There's nothing that can't be turned around <br> 
<br>
Nobody wants to be alone <br>
Everybody wants to love someone <br>
Out of the tree go pick a plum <br>
Why can't we all just get along <br> 
<br>
Boys <br>
Boys in the girl's room <br>
Girls <br>
Girls in the men's room <br>
You free your mind in your androgyny <br>
Boys <br>
Boys in the parlor <br>
Girls <br>
They're getting harder <br>
I'll free your mind in your androgyny <br> 
<br>
No sweeter a taste that you could find <br>
Than fruit hanging ripe upon the vine <br>
There's never been an oyster so divine <br>
A river deep that never runs dry <br> 
<br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br>
What you need <br> 
<br>
The birds and the bees they hum along <br>
Like treasure they twinkle in the sun <br>
Get on board and have some fun <br>
Take what you need to turn you on <br>

Boys<br>
Behind closed doors and under stars <br>
Girls <br>
It doesn't matter where you are <br>
Boys <br>
Collecting jewels that catch your eyes <br>
Girls <br>
Don't let a soulmate pass you by <br>
