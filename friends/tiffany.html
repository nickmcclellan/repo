<span class="solid">Tiffany is someone I am very lucky to have known. Unlike most of the friends on my page, I did not meet her at UGA and I did not matriculate with her in high school. Tiffany came to me during a very difficult time in my life. Sometimes called "The Darkness," I also refer to it with its more recognized description, my employment at Dial America. If I did not have Tiffany, I would not have survived that hell hole!<br>
<br>
We met when we were training on the Trilegiant program (an awful aggressive selling thing I am glad to have purged virtually all memory of). We managed to get a few weekend shifts together, and while we were not taking calls, we talked to eachother very often. At the time, we were both involved in relationships, and she was one of only a handful of people I have had to admit to that I'm gay (thankfully most people assume, but with special persons like Tiffany, I let them know). We bonded over relationship things, mutual friends, and shared Dial America-related misery. When my relationship ended, Tiffany was a good friend and helped me in venting some frustrations.</span>

<span class="solid">Though I didn't stay at Dial America, my frienship with Tiffany has endured. Though we have rarely spent much time outside of 279 Williams St., the time we did spend was meaningful and we have kept in touch through e-mail. Oh, and if you consider how often we keep "in touch" subconciously, you'd probably have to consider this a "More-than-Friends Page."<br>
<br>
Tiffany is my friend because she's a beautiful, kind person with a good heart and a great personality. She has a way of making a gloomy situation bearable and she kept me coming back to work even when it had me almost depressed to tears. I was so lucky to have a friend like Tiffany and I hope I will always continue to have that joy.<br>
<br>
And, baby, if I don't see you that often, you know I'll see you in my dreams :-*</span>
