<span class="solid">This is Matt Stephens. We started dating on May 5, 2003 after a fateful trip to Atlanta to drop of the dorm stuff at the house of one of his friends. That night, four of us piled into bed together, and Matt kissed me, and I began what was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. We were together for almost a year and a half.<br>
<br>
In September of 2004, Matt decided it was time for him to leave. He wanted to escape Athens, which he blamed for his depression, and he sought to start over in Atlanta. He also admitted that he wanted to go even farther. I had a very difficult time with his decision to leave me and Athens, but despite my pleas, I said good-bye to him in January, 2005.<br>
<br>
I still love Matt, and he is my friend. I will always have a special place for him. I haven't spoken to him since January, but I hope that one day he will speak to me again.</span>

<p><u>Run Baby Run</u></p>
<p>Love can be so strange
<br>Don't it amaze you?
<br>Every time you give yourself away
<br>It comes back to haunt you
<br>Love's an elusive charm and it can be painful
<br>To understand this crazy world
<br>But you're not gonna crack
<br>No you're never gonna crack
<br>
<br>Run, my baby, run my baby, run
<br>Run from the noise of the street and the loaded gun
<br>Too late for solutions to solve in the setting sun
<br>So run, my baby, run my baby, run!
<br>
<br>Life can be so cruel
<br>Don't it astound you?
<br>So when nothing seems too certain or safe
<br>Let it burn through you
<br>You can keep it pure on the inside
<br>And you know what you believe to be right
<br>So you're not gonna crack
<br>No you're never gonna crack
<br>
<br>Run, my baby, run my baby, run
<br>Run from the noise of the street and the loaded gun
<br>Too late for solutions to solve in the setting sun
<br>So run, my baby, run my baby, run!
<br>
<br>Find out who you are before you regret it
<br>Cause life is so short there's no time to waste it
<br>
<br>So run, my baby, run my baby, run
<br>Run from the noise of the street and the loaded gun
<br>Too late for solutions to solve in the setting sun
<br>So run, my baby, run my baby, run!</span>
