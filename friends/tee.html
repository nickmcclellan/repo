<span class="solid">TcKoy is an amazing woman, and I truly miss the time I was able to spend with her on a daily basis back in high school. Though I don't have the opportunity to talk to her very often, I do take every opportunity to soak up any "Tee Time." When Missy and I were chillin' out in the Big Easy back during Spring Break 2003, we took some time out to see Tee at her school. It was alot of fun getting the chance to see her campus and meet some of her friends.<br>
<br>
Special Tee memories: Spending our mornings Senior year in front of the Senior building talking, fighting narrow-minded bigots in our Global Affairs class, being there to clap when I got my Model UN award to show those IDIOTS that I'm worth something! Also, cruisin' 
the adult book section in Borders and looking at all the adorable gay men, our late night chats when I was a little ol' Freshman in Russell Hall (like the time I got back from going out and the fire alarm went off...that was something!)<br>
<br>
I LOVE Tee forever, and will always be there for her, whenever she needs help with any emergency and she needs a little Nick logic.</span>

<p><u>The World Is Not Enough</u></p>
<p>I know how to hurt <br>
I know how to heal <br>
I know what to show <br>
And what to conceal <br>
I know when to talk <br>
And I know when to touch <br>
No one ever died from wanting too much <br>
<br>
The world is not enough <br>
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love <br>
And if you're strong enough <br>
Together we can take the world apart, my love <br>
<br>
People like us <br>
Know how to survive <br>
There's no point in living <br>
If you can't feel alive <br>
We know when to kiss <br>
And we know when to kill <br>
If we can't have it all <br>
Then nobody will <br>
<br>
The world is not enough <br>
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love <br>
And if you're strong enough <br>
Together we can take the world apart, my love <br>
<br>
I...I feel safe <br>
I...I feel scared <br>
I...I feel ready <br>
And yet unprepared <br>
<br>
The world is not enough <br>
But it is such a perfect place to start, my love <br>
And if you're strong enough <br>
Together we can take the world apart, my love <br>
<br>
The world is not enough <br>
The world is not enough <br>
No, nowhere near enough <br>
The world is not enough</span>
