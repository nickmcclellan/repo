<span class="solid">This is my good friend Laura, finally granted Friends Page status! Yup, we've been friends since those magical days back in Mary Lyndon. She lived upstairs with all the other sexy ladies, and I lived in the basement. We weren't ever more than aquantinces until she asked me to accompany her to her Spring Formal in 2003. I had never been to a sorority formal, and I jumped at the opportunity. I mean, I think there was some queer organization meeting at Kennesaw that weekend, but who is going to turn down a dance hall full of sexy ladies and lots and lots of alcohol?? Certainly not me.<br>
<br>
Well, it turned out to be a blast, and I've gone on to many other formals and date nights since. Laura has garnered the title of "Super Sexy Sorority Girl" for a reason, of course. I mean, I'm not going to lock lips with just anyone on my 21st birthday ;-)</span>

<span class="solid">Nowadays, Laura is looking to graduate, like I am. She's dating a really wonderful guy, Gene, and she's got a cute little rascal of a kitten named...well, his name is Rascal. While I don't get the opportunity to go out to as many Gamma Sigma Sigma events as I used to, I do get the opportunity every now and then to hang out with Laura. In the Fall of 2004, we saw <em>Beetlejuice</em> at Tate. She also comes to see me when she's around my place. I really miss having more one-on-one time, like we used to have more of in Mary Lyndon, but I'm glad we still get to tool around now and then.<br>
<br>
She's one hot chick, no doubt about it!</span>
