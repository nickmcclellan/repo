<span class="solid">Wow, what can I say about Missy? Well, if you know anything about me, you know that Missy and I have been joined at the hip since that fateful day freshman year that Greg introduced us. We've been very close friends, embarked on many a road trip and Spring Break, and God knows consumed copious amounts of alcohol in eachother's presense. There's no other person at this University that been with me for nearly as much as she's been there with me. We've done everything together.<br>
<br>
Back in the day, when little Missy and I were freshman, we wrecked havoc everywhere! You could spot the two of us on Brumby Hill or driving around the West Parking Deck with the top down on her Mustang rocking out to 80's music. Sophomore Year, Missy and I brought the fun to Mary Lyndon. The most memorable moment would have to be throwing the football outside the South Parking Deck, sipping on mixed Everclear and Crystal Light drinks, and listening to Tears for Fears's <em>The Big Chair</em>. Those were the days.</span>

Junior year, Missy and I were responsible for delivering the raunchiest semester ever, with Missy staring as herself in an "orgy" or sorts. Well, let's be honest, there was an <em>orgy</em> period. Missy certainly had a flair for breaking those pesky sexual boundaries. Nowadays, Missy and I just marvel at the fact that we are still close friends and still find that those bright-eyed freshmen we once were are still a part of us.<br>
<br>
This is one person I'm not getting away from. We're friends for life, yo.</span>

<p><u>Wicked Ways</u></p>
<p>I tried hard to mend my wicked ways <br>
Acted like a lunatic for years <br>
Lord knows I try to be good <br>
I'd keep my promises if only I could <br>
You count your blessings that I can't rely on you <br>
<br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
<br>
Clutch your pictures of the Pope <br>
Pray to God for love and hope <br>
Bring the Virgin home for luck <br>
Bolt the door to keep it shut <br>
<br>
I've done things I never thought I'd do <br>
Sure it helps to lose myself in you <br>
A little time and I'll be alright <br>
C'mon sugar let's go out tonight <br>
Forgive your trespasses <br>
And all that we've been through <br>
<br>
Oh I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
<br>
Clutch your pictures of the Pope <br>
Pray to God for love and hope <br>
Bring the Virgin home for luck <br>
Bolt the door to keep it shut <br>
<br>
That sinking feeling <br>
When you are leaving <br>
All I believe in <br>
Walks out the door <br>
<br>
I tried hard to mend my wicked ways <br>
The damage's done, there's nothing left to save <br>
<br>
Oh I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
And I tried <br>
<br>
Clutch your pictures of the Pope <br>
(just like I told you) <br>
Pray to God for love and hope <br>
(just like I warned you) <br>
Bring the Virgin home for luck <br>
(just like I told you) <br>
Bolt the door to keep it shut <br>
(just like I warned you)</span>
