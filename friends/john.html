<span class="solid">Ok, so maybe I'm not that special. Sure, this is John Lynch, a god among men, but who doesn't know John Lynch? He's like an institution. Being a friend of his is not hard: he has a heart of gold and he's very caring. I'm so blessed to have had the opportunity to get to know John over the last (god, almost four years!)<br>
<br>
Well, I met John at the first Lambda meeting I ever went to (it was the second of the year). I had heard alittle about him&#8212;he was seeing my friend Greg at the time. He was really nice to me, and we went out to the Broad Street Bar & Grill where he introduced me to a bunch of people. During my frist year, John was really a good friend to me, and I guess it just took me a while to come along. We watched <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>, which was the first time I ever saw it. We also went to see U2 that year (though we somehow missed eachother at the concert :-/</span>

<span class="solid">John is by far the most valuable person that I've ever met at UGA. We had a whole lot of fun Sophomore year. I finally went to a famous John party (several actually). Yup, and where else would I have set my face on fire?? It was at John's Party. I've also gone up to see John a few times up in Maryland. He's got the coolest friends, and the nicest apartment. He's living with frat boys now. I don't know how John got into <em>that</em>, but I guess he's got the magic touch.<br>
<br>
John's getting his Masters when I get my various BA's, and we're going to leave school and get a nice job somewhere. I hope that I'm close to him, because they don't get much better than John Lynch. He's my bestest gay friend&#8212;for life!<br>
<br>
...and no, sadly, we have never dated :'(</span>
