<span class="solid">This is my friend Quiana. She is a sophisticated woman who I admire very much, who has so much talent and ambition, it's hard to see her future being nothing less than a never-ending adventure. We met during Spanish, and we had the special privilege of accompanying eachother all the way to Spanish V, which turned out to be more fun than work. Those were the days...though sometimes, I found myself so bored, that I would make mock "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" questions to pass the time (Quiana did so well to indulge my childish antics, even though they were quite annoying).<br>
<br>
The most special Quiana moments include: My endless tactless comments in Spanish which prompted Quiana to deliver a much needed lecture on the subject, Debate trips (like the one where Sade was freezing inside the van and yelled at Dina when she came in, saying "Close the fuckin door!!!"), Homecoming 2000, AP Spanish, Fiber One (which I STILL eat, and it still tastes like it has been lightly dipped in honey), her love of <em>Love Jones</em>, putting tanning lotion on my foot while watching the Daria movie, lunchroom conversations, telling me what douche meant (I am quite the fool), and that time I told Nicole that Quiana MAY have said she was a <em>SNO</em>.</span>

She's over at Queens University of Charlotte now in North Carolina (NOT South Carolina, where she grew up...though now all those times I mistook the two seemed to have foreshadowed something). I imagine I will be seeing her up for some fabulous movie award, wearing a beautiful dress, next to a sexy black man (he would be so lucky...)</span>

hard...hmmm...I think this will do, I hope...</p>

Lay down in someone else's bed <br>
