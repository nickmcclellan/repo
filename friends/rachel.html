<span class="solid">This picture is of me and Rachel out on Halloween. She's the goddess and I'm the lowly vampire...hehe. Rachel is a very cool girl, she's Dille's roommate...or should I say, Dille is Rachel's roommate. Rachel is involved with the Classics here at the university and she knows plenty about them. She can translate dead languages like NOBODY'S business.</span>

<span class="solid">Rachel is a fan of Tori Amos, and as I try to assimilate her into my garbage madness, she tries to take me into the world of Tori, which she has unfortunately not been able to do. Rachel is defiantly the nicest person I've meet this year, and I'm really glad to have had a chance to get to know her. I'm always there for Rachel and she's always there for me...we share poetry, it's very cool...Here is a picture of Tori that looks an awful lot like Rachel!</span>

<p><u>13X Forever</u></p>
<p>Thirteen times you fucked with my karma <br>
And thirteen times I fucked on your dogma <br>
You've taught me to hate <br>
You've taught me to crawl <br>
<br>
You raised your hand as you waved the bottle <br>
You knocked me down but it made me stronger <br>
The harder you hit <br>
The harder you fall <br>
<br>
And this one's for my mother <br>
What will I do without her <br>
Don't look back <br>
Don't even bother <br>
<br>
And this one's for the father <br>
Who loves his middle daughter <br>
Well here I am <br>
Don't even bother <br>
<br>
You can freak out to doubt me <br>
But you'll lose your mind without me <br>
You thought you could see right through me <br>
But it made no difference to me anyway <br>
Anyway <br>
Anyway <br>
<br>
A free reign gave you ammunition <br>
To play the game and fuck other women <br>
And something just snapped <br>
And cracked in my brain <br>
<br>
Thirteen times I fucked up inside me <br>
The different ways that you tried to harm me <br>
You did it once <br>
You'll do it again <br>
<br>
And this one's for my sister <br>
Who dared to denigrate it <br>
Don't look back <br>
Don't even bother <br>
<br>
And this one's for my lover <br>
The one who had to suffer <br>
Here I am <br>
Don't even bother <br>
<br>
You can freak out to doubt me <br>
But you'll lose your mind without me <br>
You thought you could see right through me <br>
But it made no difference to me anyway <br>
Anyway <br>
Anyway <br>
Anyway <br>
<br>
Thirteen times (one) <br>
Thirteen times (two) <br>
Thirteen times (three) <br>
Thirteen times (four) <br>
Thirteen times (five) <br>
Thirteen times (six) <br>
Thirteen times (seven) <br>
Thirteen times (eight)</span>
