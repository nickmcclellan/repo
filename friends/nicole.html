<span class="solid">This is my friend Nicole: the expatriate. Yah, it turned out that after a year in France, Nicole hadn't had enough quite yet and decided to emmigrate to the country. That isn't entirely a surprise. As it turns out, several of my friends who study abroad tend to fall in love overseas, and Nicole was no different. It was a difficult year for Nicole. She had alot to deal with. She was attempted to maintain a very long distance relationship with a not-so-supportive Fernando, which after a good two years, came to an end. Nicole dealt with issues of her own personal limits and her personal spirtuality, as well as her plans for the rest of her life. In the end, Nicole realized exactly what would make her happy...SHE DEFECTED!<br>
<br>
Well, it wasn't as dramatic as I made it out to be. I mean, she met this awesome guy in France named Alain (the non-hairy guy pictured above), and she fell in love with the country and Angers, and the University, so she decided to stay. We usually stay in touch, we write now and then. Unfortunately, though, she moved and I lost her address :-( I wish I could somehow find her, but she's been seemingly lost amongst the mass of stuck-up French people. However discouraged, I am determined to find her out!</span>

<td class="solid" align="left">This is Nicole during the one year she actually spent going to Notre Dame.  It's too bad she's not a lesbian, she could have fallen in love with <em>those</em> girls...maybe then she wouldn't have emmigrated to France :'(</td>

<span class="solid">My most cherished memories of Nicole came about the last summer she was in the States. We had a period of about four weeks to hang out like the good ol' days. We had alittle drinky-drinky w/ some of her brother's friends. We dug a hole in her yard and laid some concrete (I know, personally I liked this the best). She also took me out on her horses and gave me a free lesson! The best memory, however, would have to be when I burned my face in front of everyone when I brought her to John's party to introduce her to my friends. Yah, I was on the way to the hospital, and she came out to give me a hug and tell me she'd see me later.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, that's the last memory she hast of me&#8212;with my ugly ass burnt face. On the last night I spent with her, I was with her, Bethany, and Matt tagged along. In the course of the night, I cut up an almond with my fingernails&#8212;and unbenownst to me&#8212;I was allergic to it and broke out in a rash and my eyes got all puffy. So, here I am, giving her a hug at her door with a burnt upper lip and puffy eyes telling her I wish she didn't have to go. I mean, I would have gotten out of the country so fast!<br>
<br>
I love Nicole, and I miss her a whole lot. I will see her very soon, though, I'm sure of it.</span>

<p><u>Shut Your Mouth</u></p>
<p>Welcome <br>
We love you <br>
We hate you <br>
We love you <br>
We want you <br>
We need you <br>
We wish we were like you <br>
They say you're a saint <br>
You're a whore <br>
You're a sinner <br>
That he had you <br>
He made you <br>
He can't live without you <br>
Would you confess if we asked <br>
That you nurture the urge <br>
To declare that it's time <br>
To settle down <br>
With a man of your own <br>
You want a baby <br>
A family <br>
A piece of security <br>
<br>
Shut your mouth <br>
Try not to panic <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
If you can do it <br>
Shut your mouth <br>
Try not to panic <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
If you can do it <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
<br>
What's your opinion of the dire situation <br>
In our land here <br>
Our guest here <br>
Of course you'll be nice here <br>
How do you feel about God and religion <br>
Are you good people <br>
Bad people <br>
Guess it doesn't matter people <br>
Your place <br>
My place <br>
Make her bring that famous face <br>
You got some <br>
You want some <br>
You wanna let me get you some <br>
We know your music but of course we'd never buy it <br>
It's too fake man <br>
Right man! <br>

<br>
Shut your mouth <br>
Try not to panic <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
If you can do it <br>
Shut your mouth <br>
Try not to panic <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
If you can do it <br>
<br>
I hear you say it <br>
Play it smart girl <br>
Win the game love <br>
Give'em what they want <br>
What they want to see and you could be a big star <br>
You could go far <br>
Make a landmark <br>
What have you been reading you smart girl? <br>
Win the game love <br>
Give'em what they want <br>
What they want to see and you could be a big star <br>
You could go far <br>
Make a landmark <br>
Make a shitload <br>
<br>
And the world spins by <br>
With everybody moaning <br>
Pissing, bitching and everyone is shitting <br>
On their friends <br>
On their love <br>
On their oaths <br>
On their honor <br>
On their graves <br>
On their mouths <br>
And their words say nothing <br>
<br>
Shut your mouth <br>
Try not to panic <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
If you can do it <br>
Shut your mouth <br>
Try not to panic <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
If you can do it <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
<br>
I waited to say something <br>
Oh shut your mouth <br>
I wanted to say something <br>
Just shut your mouth <br>
I waited to say something <br>
Oh shut your mouth <br>
I wanted to be something <br>
Just shut your mouth</span>
