<span class="solid">This is Padmini, someone who I am so thankful that I have had the pleasure of getting to know. She hails from Kay-row, down in South Georgia, but she's so much more than a home-grown peach (she's wasn't even born in Georgia!) I first met the Pad at a very crowded Lambda meeting at the beginning of the semester. I was sick of standing, so I sat down next to Padmini. She introduced herself, and for some reason, I remembered her name. Something like that has happened before, when I met Rachel, I knew I had to hold onto her, couldn't forget about her. It was the same with the Pad. I saw her again and I was like, "It's Padmini!" We became much better friends after I decided to stop avoiding her in JOUR3310. We sat next to eachother and made jokes about the lecture. "Hey Nick! Cox for kids..." HAHAHAHA! Oh yah, the Pad?! What about Cox shared packages, Cox Budget Tool, Cox Slot, Cox Screaming Media, Cox-wide, and hot lead?! I see SOMEONE took notes ;-D </span>

<span class="solid">When I made the Pad's first webpage, I took her prized picture of Mo Rocca and scanned in into my computer. I sort of damaged the photo, which I lament and regret, but for her 21st birthday, I was able to reprint and frame the copy I scanned into my computer, which was wholely unharmed. The Pad works with University Union, and is responsible for helping to bring people like Mo Rocca to our campus. The Pad is also responsible for moonlite nights, romantic walks in the park, and looking at people's digital cameras when they leave pictures on them that strangers should never see (Opps!)</span>

<span class="solid">Here, the Pad has silenced all the Republicans in the Senate with her fearsome "Filaduster." Leave it to her to think up the most inventive ways to silence those conservatives.<br>
<br>
As an historical sidenote, the genesis of the Pad page came about from a good-natured challenge from Charlie over who exactly has the best Friends Page. Who knows who's got the honor of being Queen of all Friends, because you know Charlie's got that cool panorama thing going. I don't know though, who's going to be able to beat a fearsome "Filaduster"? You be the judge.</span>

<span class="solid">Since the Pad is dead sexy, I have given her this song because everytime I think about her...well, you know.<br>

<u>Sex Never Goes Out of Fashion</u><br>
<br>She's the kind of girl who likes to do it stand up
<br>From the back or anyway you want it, love
<br>From the top if you keep it going all night
<br>You're as good as the next for a fun time
<br>
<br>Lookie here like a rabbit on the dance floor
<br>Party girl like you comin' in the back door
<br>"C'mon boy, give it good, give an encore.."
<br>Never leave a hungry sister begging one more
<br>
<br>You keep it good and she'll beat you at your own game
<br>Flip a switch and she's crying out her own name
<br>Keep a lady happy as a little lamb
<br>Give her head and you're riding on a sure shot
<br>
<br>It's a sure shot... honey, it's a sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot, sure shot, sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot... honey, it's a sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot, sure shot, sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot... honey, it's a sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot, sure shot, sure shot 
<br>
<br>Wham bam slam it like a mama's man
<br>Baby's on her back doin' the can-can
<br>Such a babe-licious poco loco
<br>Make her bob, make her beg and sweat it hardcore
<br>Honky tonk lovin' keep her trembling
<br>Funky style's never out of fashion, man
<br>Keep it fresh with something for the weekend
<br>Get some, daddy... you're riding on a sure shot
<br>
<br>It's a sure shot... honey, it's a sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot, sure shot, sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot... honey, it's a sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot, sure shot, sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot... honey, it's a sure shot
<br>It's a sure shot, sure shot, sure shot
<br>
<br>A little bit more
<br>(Down her legs)
<br>A little bit more
<br>(Down her back)
<br>A little bit more
<br>(Down her neck)
<br>A little bit more
<br>(Down her arms)
<br>A little bit more
<br>(Down her breast)
<br>A little bit more
<br>(Down below)
<br>A little bit more
<br>(To her toes)
<br>A little bit more</span>
