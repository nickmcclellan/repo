<span class="solid">This is Diane.  Yes, I know, she has a bug on her head.  This doesn't typically happen with Diane.  She has pleasant, bug-free hair most of the time.<br>
<br>
Diane and I have been ESOL co-teachers during my Senior year.  I was having dinner at her apartment one night and she told me that she was going to an info session and I told her it sounded like fun.  I had known Diane for a few years, but I never got the chance to get to know her.  I mean, there was that one time we were at this Halloween party and I drove her home.  I'd like to think we really made a connection that evening.  Oh, yah, and there was that other party when we talked in Spanish to eachother while everyone looked at us dumbfounded.  Yeah, we rock.<br>
<br>
She's really dedicated at what she does and she's going to be a really sexy teacher one day.  I hear she wants to move to Australia or something, which is neat.  You know, for one there are lots more bugs that can perch themselves in her hair, but also because I know she's going to go see some amazing things.  In the time that I've known her, she's made some kick ass lesson plans.  All the students love her (especially the eligible bachelors), and she just drives us all crazy with her attempts to dress conservatively.<br>
<br>
Diane has been such fun to teach with!  I also credit her with introducing me to hummus.  Vegetarians rock!  :-)</em></span>

<p><u>Why Do You Love Me?</u></p>
<p>I'm no barbie doll<br>
I'm not your baby girl<br>
I've done ugly things and I have made mistakes<br>
And I am not as pretty as those girls in magazines<br>
I am rotten to my core if they're to be believed<br>
So what if I'm no baby bird hanging upon your every word?<br>
Nothing ever smells of roses that rises out of mud<br>
<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
<br>
You're not some baby boy<br>
Why you acting so surprised<br>
You're sick of all the rules<br>
Well I'm sick of all your lies<br>
Now I've held back a wealth of shit, I think I'm gonna choke<br>
I'm standing in the shadows with the words stuck in my throat<br>
Does it really come as a surprise when I tell you I don't feel good?<br>
Nothing ever came from nothing man<br>
Oh man, ain't that the truth<br>
<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
I get back up and I do it again<br>
I get back up and I do it again<br>
I get back up and I do it again<br>
I get back up and I do it, I do it again<br>
<br>
I think you're sleeping with a friend of mine<br>
I have no proof but I think that I'm right<br>
And you've still got the most beautiful face<br>
It just makes me sad most of the time<br>
<br>
I get back up and I do it again<br>
I get back up and I do it again<br>
I get back up and I do it again<br>
I get back up and I do it, I do it again<br>
Do it again<br>
Do it again<br>
Do it again<br>
<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me, it's driving me crazy<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br>
Why do you love me?<br></span>
