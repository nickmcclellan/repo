## Dawn of a New Blog

It's been a long time, but I used to be good at this. Having a blog can give you a world of topics to tackle, but to start I'll just start with one: Why I'm back.

I have kept my namesake registered, but languished at paying for hosting and keeping up with maintaining a code base. I used to be such a nerd about that!

Fortunately, I learned a few tricks in my career, including pulling off an open-source deployment of a Jekyll-powered Portfolio website. Along with my dusted-off GitHub handle, I hope to build out a new website to showcase my professional portfolio, highlight my personal projects, and perhaps share some film geek-aspiring thoughts.

And I'll warn you now: You might hear a thing or two about running.
