<span class="solid">Welcome to my Galleries Page! Here is where you will find a more categorized selection of the various photos you may find throughout the site. Though the site no longer boasts as many pictures as it used to (I'd like to thank Webshots for that), there are nonetheless a very impressive variety available. Happy hunting!<br>
<br>
<blockquote><em>Apologies if the selection is a bit limited to photos circa Junior/Senior Year. Most of the photos that I lost were the older ones. Though I still have most of the good ones, I haven't put them on my photo page yet. One day, I'm sure I'll get around to it, though!</em></blockquote>

I suppose the highlight would be Genevieve catching a candid picture of me napping on the lawn in Piedmont Park.</li><br>

It was the first time the two rascals saw eachother since my mother was ran out of Georgia. The highlight would be Lily's very vocal objection to the 8 hour drive back to Georgia.</li><br>

I guess you could say I was trying to be a good photographer. There are some nice pictures that may just give you a chill.</li><br>

It was very successful, the final product was praised highly by my cousin's school and her peers. I've uploaded the final submitted photo along with various (and repeatative) technical shots.</li><br>

The new album was released and they played their first show after the release day at the Tabernacle in Atlanta, GA! Needless to say, I was there. Here are photos from the concert (along with a strange "bug bus" from my high school April and I saw at the Town Center Mall).</li><br>

I only wish I could get photos from the actual show (I danced shirtless, spent too much on alcohol, apparently made out with someone, and had my first tofu dog). If only I could remember...</li><br>

Be sure to check it out. At the very least, you can observe my changing face (I swear, it's changing!)</li></span>
