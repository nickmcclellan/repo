<span class="solid">My site is named <a href="poems/thursday.html" target="_blank">"Thursday"</a> after a poem I wrote during my senior year of high school. It describes a time in my life when I was dealing with many issues involving sexuality, family, friends, and rejection. It was all terribly emotional and damaging, and that poem is my little souvenir. It is really an explanation of how things seem at this place in time: I'm poised at a junction&#8212;between the horrible work week and the blissful abyss of the forthcoming weekend, between peril and pleasantness&#8212;spanning the beginning, crashing toward the end.<br>
<br>
This website was updated from January 2002 until August 2005. It contains many webpages that I made during my tenure as an undergrad at the University of Georgia. I made many tribute pages for my closest friends and maintained a Blog for every semester I attended the school. If you would like to learn more about "Thursday" and what it all means, please visit the <a href="about.html">About Page</a>. Thank you, and enjoy!</span>

<span class="solid">Though my webpage is all about me, the only place you could ever get a brief synopsis of myself was right here. If you can't stand sifting through page after page of content, hopefully this will be your one stop spot for everything about myself.<br>
<ul>
<li>I am an avid fan of the show <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>, and I own all the seasons on DVD. From 1997 until 2003, it was the best show on television. Visit my <a href="pages/buffy.html">Buffy Page</a> to learn more about why I think the Slayer kicks ass!</li><br>
<br>
<li>As far as my musical tastes, I am into a whole variety of things. Of course, my favorite band is garbage. If you haven't figured it out already, I have made a whole webpage dedicated to them, the <a href="pages/garbage.html">garbage Page</a>. Go there to learn more about how I came to admire their music. There are other bands that I really love, like New Order, The Cure, Lauryn Hill, The Smiths, The Flaming Lips, Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Fleetwood mac, and any other 80's band or Alternative gem. Also, I am parcial to Japanese mp3's (downloaded credit themes from the anime <em>Inuyasha</em>.)</li><br>
<br>
<li>While I matriculated at UGA, I lived my life out of the closet. I am gay and I am very proud of that. I was board member to the UGA gay student union, Lambda Alliance. If you are also a queer or questioning undergrad at the University (or even an ally), please go to the <a href="http://www.uga.edu/lambda/">Lambda website</a> to learn more about what it's like to be gay at UGA.</li><br>
<br>
<li>I'm a writer. Though I mostly wrote in my Blog while I kept the website, I also published a few poems online. For a good idea of my writing talents, you can check out my <a href="poems/index.html">Poems Page</a>. Featured is the title poem for the website, <a href="poems/thursday.html" target="_blank">Thursday</a>. To review my once weekly exercise of my writing talents, please visit my <a href="journal/index.html">Blog Archives</a>.</li><br>
<br>
<li>If you didn't know already, I am an alumni of the University of Georgia. It's a wonderful town, despite a gaping lack of diversity. I still seemed to manage though. If you're interested in learning more about the University, visit us at <a href="http://www.uga.edu">uga.edu</a>.</li><br>
<br>
<li>Other than Buffy, I enjoy many television shows, which include some fun cartoon programs like <em>Futurama</em>, <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Daria</em>, and <em>The Family Guy</em>. Also, I watch alittle anime when it's really late and there's not much on. My favorite anime is <em>Inuyasha</em>, which is a fabulout feudal fairy tale on adult swim. As far as hardcore TV watching, there's not much I watch on a regular basis. You may also catch me watching <em>The Sunday Night Sex Show</em> from time to time. Also, Some of my favorite movies include <em>Amelie</em>, <em>Trois Colours: Rouge</em>, <em>Donnie Darko</em>, <em>Contact</em>, <em>Chicken Run</em>, <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>, <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em>, <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> and <em>In The Bleak Midwinter</em>.</li><br>
<br>
<li>My first dog, Brandy, was put to sleep on June 14, 2001. I made her a sort of tribute page with some interesting pictures. Go to <a href="friends/brandy.html">Brandy's Page</a> to see them and to read about why she was so special. You may also visit my <a href="friends/pets.html">Pets Page</a> to see pictures of my cat Lily and my mom's dog Joey. Both are very unique and hysterical. Lily is the sweetest cat ever, and Joey is a little wimp.</li><br>
<br>
<li>I've worked at alot of places of the years. I spent a year and a half at Kroger when I was 15. I was a cashier and eventually became a U-Scan specialist. I moved over to Target where I spent over three years working on the Sales Floor, in Electronics, as a Cashier (against my will), doing planograms, scanning markdowns, and preparing for inventory. After ditching this, I moved to Taco Mac, a charming sports bar that features Draught Beer and Buffalo Wings. I worked here during the summer of 2003 as a server, and there was alot of stress and nightmares (if you served, you'd understand). Since this job, I've been in a limbo, working at Rich's - Macy's during the holidays, still quasi-employeed at Taco Mac. In the summer of 2004, I landed a job at Dial America, and joined the ranks of my fellow poor college brothers and sisters. It's abusive and mind-numbingly boring, and I got out of that real fast! Now that I'm out of school, I do copy editing and web design. Stay tuned, because one day, I will make a new webpage and then you can see what I am up to in the here and now.
