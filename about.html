<div class="text"><span class="solid">Welcome to "Thursday," my personal website I created and maintained while matriculating at the University of Georgia. It was my first bold attempt at web design which has evolved from jumbled heap of hard returns and character spaces into a sleekly designed page with crisp CSS and various Javascript. As much as my site was an expression of my personality and desire to be heard, it has also always been a continuing exercise in web design&#8212;one that has come to its end.<br>
<br>
As I approached the impending demise of my beloved website, I worked to preserve the work I had done. In these past four years, the site has donned 8 different website themes (9 if you want to be technical). I have recreated and enriched them all, allowing visitors to see precisely how the look and feel for my website changed from semester to semester.<br>
<br>
Along with changing my website's appearance, I also created a new journal, or Blog, which served as a place for me to reflect on any given weeks trials and tribulations. For the final update, I revisited each of these Blogs, revising and enriching their appearance, and cleaning up some of my more amateur HTML.<br>
<br>
Well, I'm probably getting ahead of myself. If you've come here, you probably know nothing about "Thursday." I guess the best way to do this would be to start from the beginning...<br>
<br>
<p class="post-title">History of "Thursday"</p>
<p>The website was born on a boring evening in January 2002. I had recently broken things off with my very first boyfriend, but not before scoring a copy of the Microsoft Office suite with FrontPage, a popular web design platform. On that night, I thought I would try my hand at making my own page which would impress my friends and display my varying creative talents. Since I started school, I had always included small vignettes in my AIM profile with little shout-outs to my friends. With my website, I could move them to a more exciting (and expansive) medium.</p>
With my website, I incorporated several themes over the years. All have been recreated for the final update. Just so you've got some background, here's how each theme came about.</p>
<p><a href="index1.html"><img src="spr02icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left" class="solid"></a>The first theme reflected the recent garbage album that had been released, <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>. I had not mastered the art of graphic design and my creativity had not adapted to the possibilities of web design. I guess I just didn't know what I could do, so I just coveted what I knew. In retrospect, though, the site did not look half bad.</p>
<p>The shout-outs became Friends Pages. The front page got some picture content (which remains on the page to this day), and I was able to scrounge up some makeshift icons to represent the pages I had on the site. Also, my journal was born, along with the Gay Page, the Links Page, the Poems Page, and a short-lived Lyrics Page (which was later axed to make room on the server). By the end of the summer, my webpage was very much alive and I was becoming more and more dedicated to developing my web design style and skills.</p>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p><a href="index3.html"><img src="fall02icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>At the beginning of the new Fall semester, I decided to change the theme&#8212;an act which would soon become tradition. Though it certainly wasn't the best looking theme of the site (probably the worst), you could definitely say it was a design all my own. At the end of that summer, I worked very hard to produce and original, inspired theme. For some reason, I wanted a paper look&#8212;"Recycled", is what I called it. I even hand drew my own link bar which I recreated for the final update.</p>
<p>I added the Galleries Page during this update, which became my second most visited page after my Internet Journal. Also, the Journal got much more involved than the previous semester. I also began to title my entries. Sadly, though, this would be the most difficult of my journals to read. The entries are often personal and confrontational. I learned my lesson, though, and the journal got better the following semester.</p>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p><a href="index4.html"><img src="spr03icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>For my next update, I decided to make things alittle more airy, in a sense. I referred to it at the time as a "beautifulgarbage/Breaking Up The Girl" sort of style, which denotes a more upbeat or "sunshiney" visual style, but I mostly refer to it as the cloud update. I use the pun on the word "Morning" to denote this theme in the final update as it was a time of mild depression and new beginnings.</p>
<p>Again, I created my own link bar, this time with less white. For the final update, I used the same drawings and added a bit of interactivity in the form of rollover icons. Also, I replaced the background with a more well behaved cloud. It was also during this time that I introduced the Sherry Page, which was my first web comic.</p>
<p><hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p><a href="index5.html"><img src="fall03icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>With my fourth update, I finally began to grow into my own. Though the year consisted of mostly the colors black and white, the style had never looked so crisp and clean. I originally referred to this update as the "Stripped" update, but since I would like to avoid any relation to that Christina Aguilera video or album, I refer to it as "Trash Boy," which is what I am often referred to when people see my screenname, basuraboi3 (and also since the background looks like a crumpled piece of trash).</p>
<p>It was the last update that I drew the linkbar myself. For the final update, I cleaned up the edges some, but the drawings remain the same. At the time, the website didn't undergo too many changes. I began referring to my Internet Journal as a Blog. Entries continued as normal and even became more interesting.</p>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p><a href="index6.html"><img src="spr04icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>For my penultimate Spring update, I focused more on the darker side of the black and white spectrum. Though the previous update looked real sharp, I really blew the top off on this one. I call it "Fiend" because I got the gray construction paper background from the Making Fiends website. During this update I also made the linkbar in MS Paint (I know, very amateur) and even used my first Javascript on the site. Hello rollover icons!</p>
<p>Also, for this update's Blog, I incorporated icons into the experience. It added a more consistant visual element to the site and allowed me to be more creative. Suddenly, I could incorporate icons based on my mood. The site really began to mature and grow as my writing got more sharply atuned and less juvenile.</p>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p><a href="index2.html"><img src="fall01icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>As I approached my final year at UGA, I wanted to work toward completing my website. It had always bugged me that I never incorporated any content from my first Fall semester. In the interest of completing the site, I transcribed entries from my personal journal during the summer before my Fall 2004 update along with creating a theme reminiscent of my personal journal.</p>
<p>Since the site didn't even exist then, I can't say much about what I added to it. For the final update, I created what I envision would have been the theme for the site. The only face time it had on the site was in the final few weeks before I finished the website in August of 2005.</p>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p><a href="index7.html"><img src="fall04icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>While the theme for the Fall of '04 was original, it wasn't as effective as the two themes before it. The icons were interesting, but boring. It was my last garbage theme as the background color was the same used for the interim garbage site established before they released their 4th studio album.</p>
<p>Not much came out of the site at this time as I was going through alot of personal issues. The Blog survived, though it was a whole lot less frequently updated than in years past. I used CSS for the first time seriously on the site and even incorporated a few new HTML tricks throughout. The revision of the Blog certainly brings out the potential of this theme that was sadly never realized when it had its time to shine.</p>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p><a href="index8.html"><img src="spr05icon.gif" width="199" height="63" hspace="5" border="0" align="left"></a>For my final update, I took on my most ambitious and original update ever. I envisioned transparent text boxes and a site-wide HTML maturity boost. It was a few months before everything was in place, but my flower power theme, which I refer to as "Almost Free," was by far the best looking and most successful update.</p>
<p>I updated all the pages in anticipation for the final update. For the first time, I forwent an HTML Blog for a Blogger enabled template with comment ability. In the final few weeks before the update, I added my own radio.blog to feature my soundtrack for the semester. It was my finest hour on the site, and sadly my last.</p>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
<p>It has been a sorted four years, but that's the story. Now that the website is complete, you can reminisce to your hearts content. With the exception of one entry, all previous Blogs are available for browsing.</p>
<p>To make looking back a bit easier, I have written retrospective Blogs on each year at UGA. For the gory details, be sure to head to the <a href="journal/index.html">Blog Archive</a>.</p>
<p class="post-title">Purpose</p>
<br>
While I was actively updating the site, the purpose always seemed to be to develop my web design skills. Having a fresh new Blog to write or page to design always seems to spurn my development as a web programmer.<br>
<br>
Now that I would like to leave the site behind me, the purpose has changed. My desire to leave this final update reflects my need to fulfill this purpose as well as to honor the work that I have done (and also to set the record straight on a few issues).<br>
<br>
The purpose of the site, as I would like to see it, is to prove to anyone about to embark on their own college adventure that it is a journey you can survive. It's not an easy trek and there are alot of things that can go wrong. I had moments when I was happy and very sad. There were times when I felt like I couldn't cut it and and then there were times when I felt like I could take over the world. If you come across this site and find you are in a similar situation as me, take whatever valuable advice or otherwise that I have to impart and do with it what you must.<br>
<br>
It is my hope that some wayward underclassman will one day find this site, read about me and my experiences, and feel that perhaps he or she is not alone in this world. I hope they realize that there is really someone out there that went through what they are enduring&#8212;someone who survived and got out. I hope that this site will be a comfort to someone, someday. If that ever happens, please let me know. The e-mail address is on the front page.<br>
<br>
<p class="post-title">Site Navigation</p>
<br>
You can find this on the front page, but just for convenience, here is a short roadmap to the pages and content you can find on the site:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="pages/gay.html">Gay Page</a>: From the first day I arrived at UGA, I resolved to live my life out of the closet. I did not want to compound a lie I had been living for years&#8212;I wanted to be honest and proud. Visit the Gay Page to learn how living my life in college, out and proud, truly enriched and livened the experience for me.</li><br>
<br>
<li><a href="pages/garbage.html">garbage Page</a>: Every since I first heard the haunting chords of "#1 Crush," I knew there was something about garbage. The band formed in 1994 and has since spawned four excellent Alternative music albums. Visit the garbage Page to learn why I love this group of misfits and the music they create. Also included is a list of my favorite songs along with highlighted lyric selections.</li><br>
<br>
<li><a href="friends/index.html">Friends Page</a>: Before I created my website, my AIM profile consisted of one-to-two line shout-outs to my various friends. To save space, I moved these shout-outs to my new website. In the past four years, I have updated and expanded the original Friends Pages and added even more. Visit the Friends Page to meet the people that made my college experience memorable.</li><br>
<br>
<li><a href="pages/buffy.html">Buffy Page</a>: From March 3, 1997 to May 20, 2003, the television program <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> engaged in a battle against evil. It was a remarkable show and it left us with seven seasons of television master work. Visit the Buffy Page to learn my opinion of the show that changed television. Also available is a selection of my ten favorite episodes.</li><br>
<br>
<li><a href="pages/links.html">Links Page</a>: As any other doofus with an Internet connection, I have secured a valuable array of useful links that are both entertaining and useful. I suppose while making my webpage I noticed most personal webpages had their very own Links Page. This is mine. Visit the Links Page to see my categorized catalog of links that may serve to brighten your doldrum day.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><a href="sherry/index.html">Sherry Page</a>: Since creating her during my 7th grade year, Sherry Cherry has always been merry. I never dared share her with the world. She was always my private little distraction, but since creating my own webpage, it has always been my dream to have my very own web comic. Visit the Sherry Page to see the adventures of Sherry and all her nutty pals.</li><br>
<br>
<li><a href="journal/index.html">Journal Page</a>: This is the main attraction of "Thursday." Since the Spring of 2002, I have kept a weekly Internet Journal&#8212;or Blog. At the conclusion of my four years here at UGA, I have completed my collection of Blogs by archiving all seven semesters of journals as well as including a selection from my personal journal from the Fall of 2001, my first semester at UGA. Visit the Blog page to witness my personal narrative of my four years. Also included are the 4 special Blog Retrospectives complete with summary reflection and highlights.</li><br>
<br>
<li><a href="galleries/index.html">Galleries Page</a>: Though I have never been one to take pictures, I do have quite a few photogenic memories of my four years at UGA. Whether it be a random road trip, a candid photo, or an embarrassing party snapshot, you'll find them all here. Visit the Galleries Page to see the selection of photos I have posted throughout the site as well as photos you will find only here.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li><a href="poems/index.html">Poems Page</a>: Since before I even created my website, I have had an interest in writing poetry. I indulged this desire throughout my time at UGA. I wrote some memorable poems on my own and also under the guidance of my creative writing professors. Though I have aborted my more insipid pre-college poetry, there remains a very unique selection of poems I think you will find most enjoyable. Visit the Poems Page to discover my more abstract view of the world.</li>
<br>
<br>
</ul>
<hr class="about" align="center"><br>
Well, that's all I can say about "Thursday." Have fun looking around, and if you have any questions, send me an e-mail or catch me on my AIM if I'm ever on it (which won't be often now that I'm gone.)<br>
<br>
Thanks for visiting, and I hope you like the update!
