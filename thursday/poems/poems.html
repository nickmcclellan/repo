<span class="solid">I'm well aware my poetry over the last few years has <i>sucked</i>.  I didn't actually realize that until I recently took Advanced Creative Writing.  Yah, I know, I have been subjecting random visitors to seemingly good poetry when in reality it was just the ramblings of an immature high school student.  Many apologies.<br>
<br>
<p>In the interest of sharing some of my more innovative poetry here, I'm revamping the whole page.  The older poems are gone.  I'm keeping "Thursday" and "Separation" mostly because they are mean alot to me.  I will continue to add poems that I believe are examples of my best work.  Expect some more interesting poems in the future.  I'll likely be writing my whole life, and I plan to be 100!  Expect my first Canto around 2070 :-$<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="thursday.html" target="_blank">"Thursday"</a>:  I wrote this while I was still in high school.  I used to consider the poem one of my best, but now as I mature in my writing, I look back on it as one of my first steps into coherent poetry...<i>and confusing blood imagery!</i></li><p>
<li><a href="separation.html" target="_blank">"Separation"</a>:  One of my most moody poems, I tried to channel some really intense emotions into something that would likely last longer than hard feelings.  It may not mean much to the casual reader, but to me, and maybe someone else, it might sound somewhat familiar.  Even if no one ever recognizes it, it served to be great closure.</li><p>
<li><a href="mywill.html" target="_blank">"My Will"</a>:  This is my most ambitious poem to date.  In writing it, I very desperatly tried to leave behind the various rejection themes of my earlier poems.  Instead of focusing on my own experiences with rejection, I focused on the relationship between Inuyasha, Kikyo, and Kagome in the anime <i>Inuyasha</i>.</li><p>
<li><a href="viewsource.html" target="_blank">"View Source"</a>:  In this poem, I experimented with some concepts advanced by the Language poets.  Its inspiration came from the same window you're viewing this webpage one.  By using some of the HTML diction I encounter every day, I tried to make something a little more interesting out of something so dull.</li><p>
<li><a href="crescendo.html" target="_blank">"Crescendo"</a>:  One of my other aims in my more recent poetry is to write an engaging short poem.  Focusing on the poem "Separation" above, I yielded something a bit shorter and slightly aged.  In the spirit of "In a Station of the Metro", I continue to sharpen my shorter poems.</li>
</ul>
