<span class="solid">At long last, Leena has been liberated from Dille! Well, that's not necessarily a bad thing, those girls are tight, but she's been given her own Friends Page! Also, she's got that sexy picture as seen above. She's hot, no doubt about it!<br>
<br>
Leena and I met on a magical evening, during my freshman year. Greg and Co. went to Tasty World one night, and Leena showed up with Dille, and I got a chance to talk to someone who wasn't all about getting shit-faced drunk! Back in those pre-alcohol days, Leena and I were like peas n' carrots. Oddly enough, she was the second person I ever came out to (as crazy as it sounds, it's true). We were walking to Bel-Jean, and I told her I was gay, and though I think she knew, she should feel flattered to know that I felt she was important enough to tell.<br>
<br>
Fun Leena memories: Being all spiteful of Greg in her room in Church when she started dating John (but I love John!), many a' Country Music Wednesday night at O-house with the gang, that time I grabbed her cell phone and left a suggestive voicemail for a guy she had a crush on at the time and I made her "list" (I remember telling her, "If I'm going to be on the list, I want to be number one!"), hating that bastard Ilya (remember that twisted affair??), that night at Aspen after Leena got back from New Zealand and I was getting drunk and Missy walked in and fell flat on her face (that was sweet!), and recent drunk dancing at New Year's, where Leena looked especially sexy because she was all graduated and <em>glowing</em>!</span>

<p><u>Get Busy with the Fizzy</u></p>
<p>Well I might just consider this
<br>If you don't let me down
<br>If you can keep me happy
<br>Well you can stick around
<br>Now I don't care for sycophants
<br>They drive me round the bend
<br>But if you can't control yourself
<br>Then let's just keep good friends
<br>
<br>Let's make out in the back of your car
<br>Let's go driving and toddling around
<br>We can always get lost in a crowd
<br>Are you ready to get deep down?
<br>
<br>Now there's something you should know about
<br>I'm chronically depressed
<br>I internalize my hatred
<br>And sacrifice myself
<br>Now I am busy Saturday
<br>But I am free tonight
<br>And I might have to sort you out
<br>If you don't do it right
<br>
<br>Let's make out in the back of your car
<br>Let's go driving and toddling around
<br>We can always get lost in a crowd
<br>Are you ready to get deep down?
<br>
<br>Get Busy with the fizzy baby
<br>Get Busy with the fizzy baby
<br>Get Busy with the fizzy baby
