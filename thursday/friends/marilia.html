<span class="solid">This is my friend Marilia. I must say, when I first made her Friends Page, I would not expect that she and I would become as close as we have. At the beginning of my Junior Year, Marilia and I moved into a house together on the East Side. She had just got out of her first year in the dorms, and she wanted some more space for herself. I was in desperate need of roommates to populate my place and split the rent with me. What started out as on odd pairing turned into a very volatile, close, and sexy friendship.<br>
<br>
Much can be said about my year with Marilia. She certainly has an odd affliction toward certain foods. She would go on these strange health kicks, making all sorts of healthy foods. One week, she made a completely sugar-free cake. She asked me to try it, and I must admit, it tastes a whole lot like air. Marilia also had a very strange habit of walking around her room completely naked. I would knock on the door, seeing if she was around, and she'd always answer back, "Hold on a sec, I need to get dressed." I kept telling myself, it's because she's Brazilian. She's just crazy!</span>

<span class="solid">Well, she may have been pretty nuts, but Marilia turned out to be one of my most dear friends. She was one of the only ones there for me during some of the most difficult times that year. She'd always take me to places in her car, which I am really thankful for. It's too bad she wrecked that car when she was on her way to a sex party dressed as a cheap whore. Though I tend to disagree with her, she said she had about 20 guys drive by when she was stuck on the side of the road, asking if she needed any help.<br>
<br>
In the Winter of 2005, Marilia embarked on the study abroad experience she had been planning since she was a wee Freshman in Paine Hall: 10 months in Santiago, Chile. I realized, the last night I saw her, that I would not see her again until I have long graduated from UGA and moved away from Athens. This made me very sad, and so I wanted to do something very special for her, so here it is.<br>
<br>
I love Marilia very much. She's my best and very close friend. At times when I feel lonely, or like I need to talk to someone who's going to give me a straight answer, I look to her. She might be alittle abrasive sometimes, but like most household cleaners, that's how you know it's working. If you're on level ground with her and she hasn't taken your head off, it must mean you're alright. I'm very proud to have Marilia as one of my most dear friends (even if she's a foreign piece of shit!)<br>
<br>
Trust me, she knows what I mean.</span>

Head into the clouds<br>
Past the buildings<br>
By the harbor<br>
Through the storm<br>

Tear across the page<br>
By the marker<br>
Leave the light on<br>
By the poolside<br>
