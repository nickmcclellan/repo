<span class="solid">This here is my good friend Melissa who lives in California. She moved to Georgia during my Junior year, and I instantly took a shining toward her. She's she sweetest person, and we always used to do crazy stuff after school. She has the craziest personality, as seen in her website...if I find a link to it again, I will place it here. We always used to tell eachother we'd be friends forever, and I really want to stick to that, because I am truly blessed to have friends like her.</span>

<p><u>When I Grow Up</u></p>
<p>Cut my tongue out <br>
I've been caught out <br>
Like a giant juggernaut <br>
<br>
Happy hours <br>
Golden showers <br>
On a cruise <br>
To freak you out <br>
We could fly a helicopter <br>
Nothing left to talk about <br>
<br>
Entertain you <br>
Celebrate you <br>
I'll be back to frame you <br>
<br>
Chorus: <br>
When I grow up <br>
I'll be stable <br>
When I grow up <br>
I'll turn the tables <br>
<br>
Trying hard to <br>
Fit among you <br>
Floating out to wonderland <br>
<br>
Unprotected <br>
God I'm pregnant <br>
Damn the consequences <br>
<br>
(Chorus) <br>
<br>
Blood and blisters <br>
On my fingers <br>
Chaos rules when we're apart <br>
<br>
Watch my temper <br>
I go mental <br>
I'll try to be gentle <br>
<br>
(Chorus) <br>
<br>
When I grow up <br>
When I grow up <br>
When I grow up <br>
I'll turn the tables <br>
<br>
Don't take offense <br>
Can I make amends <br>
Rip it all to shreds <br>
And let it go <br>
<br>
Don't take offense <br>
Can I make amends <br>
Rip it all to shreds <br>
And let it go <br>
<br>
Rip it all to shreds and let it go <br>
Rip it all to shreds and let it go <br>
Rip it all to shreds and let it go</span>
