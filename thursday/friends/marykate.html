<span class="solid">This is my buddy Mary-Kate (and her girlfriend Jess, who's on the left) She and I met during the grooviest of semesters, Spring 2003. I was dating this guy Jeff at the time, and he told me that whenever he needed a party connection, MK was his girl. So, I met Mary-Kate and she seemed really cool. I don't know why, but she seemed like a person that alot of people grab hold of, but somehow let slip away. Fortunate for me, I did not let that happen.<br>
<br>
While my relationship with Jeff didn't last, my relationship with Mary-Kate has. Her, Jerm, and I had some fun one fateful night at Boneshakers. During my junior year, when MK became an RA for a semester in Lipscomb, we had a nice evening hanging out and talking. I really miss having her around like those days, but eventually people change and move on. Mary-Kate got a sweet place out on Pulaski, and I got to see her new digs at a very cool house-warming party. She's just so radiant, and everyone loves MK&#8212;everyone was there! We had a good time, and it was like I had my homegirl all over again (almost half as good as when we got to make out during a steamy night of spin the bottle!)</span>

<span class="solid">During my senior year, alot of really wonderful things happened for Mary-Kate. She met a very nice girl, Jessica, and she realized that her unique energies were better served elsewhere, and so she took a break. I was dealing with alot at the time, so I really couldn't give her the send off she deserved, but I hope this somehow makes up for it. I don't make Friends Pages for everyone. You have to be special, and unique, and it has to be deserved. This is something I should have done along time ago.<br>
<br>
I love you Mary-Kate, and you will always be my friend.</span>

<span class="solid">Mary-Kate is so very Special. And everyone knows this song rocks!</p>
<p><u>Special</u></p>
<p>I'm living without you
<br>I know all about you
<br>I have run you down into the ground
<br>Spread disease about you over town
<br>
<br>I used to adore you
<br>I couldn't control you
<br>There was nothing that I wouldn't do
<br>To keep myself around and close to you
<br>
<br>Do you have an opinion?
<br>A mind of your own?
<br>I thought you were special
<br>I thought you should know
<br>But I've run out of patience
<br>I couldn't care less
<br>
<br>I...
<br>I...
<br>
<br>Do you have an opinion?
<br>A mind of your own?
<br>I thought you were special
<br>I thought you should know
<br>
<br>It used to amuse you
<br>I knew that I'd lose you
<br>Now you're here and begging for a chance
<br>But there's no way in hell I'd take you back
<br>
<br>Do you have an opinion?
<br>A mind of your own?
<br>I thought you were special
<br>I thought you should know
<br>But I've run out of patience
<br>I've run out of comments
<br>I'm tired of the violence
<br>I couldn't care less
<br>
<br>I'm looking for a new
<br>I'm looking for a new
<br>I'm looking for a new
<br>I'm looking for a new
<br>
<br>We were the talk of the town
<br>We were the talk of the town
<br>We were the talk of the town
<br>We were the talk of the town
<br>
<br>I thought you were special
<br>I thought you were special
<br>I thought you were special
