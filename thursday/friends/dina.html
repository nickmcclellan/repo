<span class="solid">Dina is the exciting young woman you see above. She is, BY FAR, the most attractive, sexy black woman that I have ever met. She's like the Black Shirley Manson, she's fucking amazing!<br>
<br>
Dina is such an amazing girl. I remember one afternoon gathering supplies for our LUNG project for BIO, and SHIT-MOBILE broke outside of Hobby-town. It was really funny, but Dina was there for me, in her respective shit-mobile, and we soldiered through it. I introduced her to peanut butter cinnamon bread sandwiches that night... We also would see each other each morning in front of the Senior building. That was always fun. Dina also sent me a really sweet note on my birthday, which I still possess to this day...<br>

<blockquote><i>Nicholas...You know I love you!!  LOL.  So smile.  I gotcha, you think I'd actually forget another November baby's B-day?  We're buddies 'yo.  What do you want?  I'm packing them all in w/ Christmas.  I got you covered, 'kay?<br>

<u>Can't Seem To Make You Mine</u><br>
<br>
I can't seem to make you mine<br>Kissin' all around all the time<br>
Flyin' around like a bee<br>
Hurtin' everything you see<br><br>
I tried everything that I know<br>
To make you want to love me so<br>
The only thing you do<br>
Is try to put the hurt on me<br><br>
Can't you see what you're doin' to me<br>
You fill my heart with misery<br>
With every breath, every step I take<br>
I'm more in love with you<br><br>
I can't go on like this<br>
A little bit of love, not a kiss<br>
I gotta have your love every day<br>
One little bit I say<br><br>
Can't you see what you're doin' to me<br>
You fill my heart with misery<br>
With every breath, every step I take<br>
I'm more in love with you<br><br>
I can't seem to make you mine<br>
I can't seem to make you mine<br>
Kiddin' all around all the time<br>
I can't seem to make you mine<br>
Flyin' around like a bee<br>
Hurtin' everything you see<br>
I can't seem to make you mine<br>
I can't seem to make you mine<br>
I can't seem to make you mine<br>
Can't seem to make you mine</span>
