<span class="solid">Welcome to my online comic!  Above this worthless blurp is a picture of the radiant Sherry Cherry.  Who is Sherry Cherry, you might ask.  Sherry is a complicated woman, and you really need to experience her radient personality on your own.  Here are a few facts about this amazing woman...</p>
<ul>
<p><li>&nbsp;Sherry's best friend is Nancy Nutt</p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Sherry used to date a prude named Eggbert, but he's dead now, SHE'S SINGLE!</p>
<p><li>&nbsp;If you see Cinnimon, he's an alien from another planet with super powers (and he's from Jamaica...not sure how that happened)</p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Sherry works in a lab and makes crazy inventions</p>
<p><li>&nbsp;Above ALL, CHERRIES ARE MERRY!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy the comic!</p>
<p><b><a href="sc-01.html">Episode One:  Talking Fruit?</a></b>: Sherry and Nancy discuss the meaning of their strange existence.  Who the hell thought of the concept of talking fruit anyways?</p>
<p><b><a href="sc-02.html">Episode Two:  Ducking Frunk!</a></b>: Sherry's in the lab working on a drink that's bound to FUCK YOU UP!  Mipsy, Sherry's sorority girl "I'm not an alcoholic!" friend tests out some of Sherry's most innovative concoctions.</p>
<p><b><a href="sc-03.html">Episode Three:  Sledgehammer Sherry</a></b>: Don't you hate it when pompous Peas and Pinto Beans disrupt your precious park-sitting-and-staring-at-the-sky time?  Certainly a short temper and the "Sledge-man 3000" can clear up this sticky situation...</p>
<p><b><a href="sc-04.html">Episode Four:  Filled Out!</a></b>: Mipsy's at it again!  In alcohol-induced frenzy, she's after any piece of ass she can find!  What I don't understand is why Sherry won't get involved in the action :-p</span>
