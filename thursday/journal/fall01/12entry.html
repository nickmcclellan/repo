<h2 class="date-header">Another night at Boneshakers...</h2>
<div class="post">
<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm going to Boneshakers tonight, just not with Greg.  I decided I'd go with John.  I hope I'm not crashing anyone's party.  Anthony made me think that maybe people aren't avoiding me; I just haven't called anyone.  I can accept that really easy, I really don't like hearing that people don't enjoy my company.  I think I'll approach this temporary inflated sense of hope with severe skeptism.  I don't want to get too hopeful and just become disapponted.</p>
<p>What has happened to me?  I've come very far, farther then I could imagine.  In the coming weeks, I'm sure I'll transcent even my present state.  I'm reaching "The End", in a sense.  Soon, I won't have anymore room to write, and it will be a closing: a closing of my first book.  Certainly not my last.  I plan on writing my whole life, forever and ever, at least until I die.  I figure this book's theme could be summed up as transitions, self-esteem and strength, and individuality.  I want to write at length about everything.  I want to make a final reflection on everything before the end.  I want to explain how coming out is so important.  I want to explain the true value of friendship.  I want to put into perspective everything, and maybe write about some stuff I don't usually write about.  I will do this all soon.  I wish something will happen to truly end this book for me.  Surely I've been building up to something.  Whenever I feel that has happened, I will begin to digress.  I know my next book will be something very different.  I'm no longer a teenage gay boy anymore.  I'm growing into a gay man, into a very hostile world for myself.  I'm not sure what that will mean for me.  Independence.  Love.  Heartbreak.  Disaster.  All are sure to come.</p>
<p>April has decided that she's going to have sex with Matt.  I'm unsure what this choice means.  I'm wondering if I'm jealous in some way.  Kinda officially, I don't agree with it too much.  She has only been dating him not even half the summer.  It's not a very important opinion of mine.</p>
<blockquote><i>Yah, I was a little jealous of April, surely.  She'd already found the man of her dreams, and I was still wating on my first kiss!  Yah, so they had sex, it was the right decision, and I just had to deal with it.  You go April.  You're a sexy beast!<br>
<br>
Other then that, useless reflections on "how far" I had come since high school.  Yah, it's more then just physical distance traveled to Athens, it's mental too.  Honestly, though, it's a faux sense of responsibility and maturity.  Freshman are some of the most immature people I know.  They think their so big because their a hop, skip, and a jump away from mommy and daddy.  It's funny when they lose HOPE, take out large sums of money in loans, drop several classes because of their extracurricular habits, and have to work full time in the summer just to get their degree.  Actually, not that funny, but maybe fitting.</i>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I had another one of THOSE nights.  Damn my breaking barriers.  Greg didn't call to invite me to Boneshakers AGAIN, so I lay sulking in my room, mulling over whether or not I should call Juan.  I actually ended up deciding I would call him (though I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have), but John invited me to go to Boneshakers with him...shoot, I already wrote that I guess.  Well, it always takes me awhile to get into the mood to dance, so I just stood there like a loser, just chatting with John.  I was introduced to a few people, and I met this older guy that Matt told me to stay away from; which I did, of course.  I finally ended up dancing with John (as friends, of course!).  Juan came up and danced alittle, then went somewhere.  John then left, and Juan returned.  We started the bad dancing, for a little bit.  He left to pee, and John came back.  Whenever I danced with John, Juan would stay away...but John left again.  Dancing alone, I was soon not.  Juan pulled me up on stage and we started getting really close.  I talked alittle, but we soon got really touchy-feely.  Then he kissed me.</p>
<p>Yes.  My first kiss.  I actually made it a small peck which was followed by a tongue fest.  He was drinking so I could taste his gross mouth.  He got really lustful with his tongue, very fast.  I tried to keep up, but it was too new for me.  I still liked it.  I'll reflect more on this soon.</p>
<p>I ended up seeing Ilya there.  I let him know that I wasn't too upset with him.  I didn't go into why I never wanted to be around him or Greg when they did drugs.  It was nice to see him.</p>
<p>We all ended out on the porch to talk...btw, Greg and crew were absent.  It seems he actually was studying...BIG SURPRISE!  Anyways, that whole idea that Justin had any interest in me was completly broken when I found out he thought I was str8!  I mean, COME ON!  I went to Lambda and I love going to Boneshakers...is it ANY more obvious?  Oh, I don't care, I'll just have to see if it changes anything.</p>
<p>So many things to write...Well, we left later, with minimal bad dancing between me and Juan...but this older woman kept spoiling our fun, I didn't know WHAT her problem was.  Well, we left, I told Tee, she was surprised.  I'm going to tell her more about it tonight.</p>
<p>The WEIRDEST thing happened before I went to sleep last night!  I closed my eyes and had this perfect memory of Aaron Shores glaring at me.  He was dressed in dark clothing leaning up against something.  I'm not sure WHAT that's supposed to mean, but it made me really uneasy.</p>
<p>Just like Sean, I don't know where I stand with Juan.  I think it's just my "fifteen minutes" with Juan--my turn.  I don't want to be a slut though, but I would love to make out, or whatever.  I think sex may be going too far.  Once again, I'll have to see.</p>
<p>Even when I was the farthest from Greg, I felt the most Greg-o-centric.  Just participating in a feeling that I am away from him is very Greg-o-centric (new word).  I'll get over it, hopefully...with time.</p>
<blockquote><i>So yah, my first kiss was fun, but very messy.  I refer to it as the time the slutty guy started to lick my face.  I actually still see Juan around Athens.  After Spring semester, his parents sent him to reparitive therapy for his homosexual "condition."  It didn't work though--I saw him at Boneshakers once this summer.  He's a nice guy, but talking to him again would be too strange...plush, he was a total slut.  It's probably good I only got fifteen minutes.</i>
