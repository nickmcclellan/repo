That gives me a major edge over my peers.  I'm going to really try to unleash the sleeping Mary Anne Gragg in me.  It would be very cool if I graduate a Presidential Scholar...but I really doubt it.  I'll just have to do my best and not the bare minimum.  I really tended to do that in high school.</p>
<blockquote><i>A short entry, granted.  Coming to UGA, I felt like I could really flourish academically.  Socially, I was unsure where I'd fit in, but I knew that I'd have all my other shit in order.  It was a comfort, to say the least.</i>

<img border="0" src="jour01icon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm meeting this gay guy Greg today.  I'm sorta nervous, but this is a big step for me.  Though its in my head, I'm thring to push back that I would possibly date him.  I think it would be cool to have another gay buddy.  And then we could branch out.  We could be the first freshman gay clique.  I really hope he likes me.  I read on this gay resource site that after coming out, it's natural for gay guys to want to meet other gay guys...then to have a building sense of pride.  I think this is a good thing for me.  Greg could help me go to that Lambda group...I'm getting really ahead of myself.  I'll try to reflect later on our meeting.</p>
<blockquote><i>Yah, meeting Greg was a big deal for me.  I'd never meet any other gay guy (except for one, and that ended badly).  It was very nerve-racking for me...sitting in the Russell lobby waiting for him.  I was afraid no one would want to be my friend.<br>
<br>
I remember sitting in my room in Russell--likely on my computer--looking out of my door and seeing people walking by.  They had already made friends, and I was sitting at home alone.  It was depressing!  I thought my life would be holed up in that suffocating space.  Thankfully, that didn't last.</i>
