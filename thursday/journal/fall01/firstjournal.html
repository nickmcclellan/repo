<p>It always kind of bugged me that I learned how to make webpages in the Spring of 2002 instead of during my first semester at UGA.  Looking at those first Internet Journals...something was missing!  So much happened to me during the Fall of 2001.  I met my first gay friend.  I met some really amazing people, Missy for example.  Some amazing things also happened to me.  There were some amazing nights.  It's unfortunate that I don't have a Blog to chronicle all those nights, but I do have the pages of my journal to send some sort of impression.<br>
<br>
If you choose to read this, keep in mind these words were never meant to be read by anyone else but me.  This has convinced me to do some moderate censoring, of course.  Each entry will consist of the words I wrote followed by a short retrospective, generally explaining my <i>bad writing</i> and <i>bad decisions</i>.  It's not glamorous, most of the time, but it happened.  Now nobody's going to let that go!<br>
<br>
Another note:  These entries are NOT weekly chronicles.  The majority of them are actually entries from the same month.  Keep in mind that I didn't write too frequently during the Fall of 2001.  The timeline of this clump of journals spans from the day I graduated high school to the nights before I created my webpage.

In this Blog retrospective, I point out some of the more interesting times of my first year at UGA. I came out. I met some of the most amazing people with whom I'm still friends with. And most importantly, I created this website. If you don't feel like combing through several various individual entries, then sit back, and take a look at this one. It's got everything that's worth knowing.</td>
