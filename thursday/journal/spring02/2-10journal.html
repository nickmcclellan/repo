<p>Oh, I had a troubling run today. I ran 4 laps before my legs had horrible cramps and I could not run any longer. I really wanted to run 5 miles, but was not able to...BUT I TRIED! I did do my 200 crunches though, so that was a good thing.<br>
<br>
My trip home was short-lived, but good. It seemed kinda pointless though, I wish I could have stayed longer. It was just a change of atmosphere, and not really a good reason to go home. I know I needed to go home, but I wish I could have done something more productive with my time there. I DID get a new cell phone though. TO ONE AND ALL, I have free nights and weekends now, so I can CALL anyone on the weekends, ANYWHERE...because I have free long distance too. Just let me know if you would like to chat, and I'll be there for you.<br>
<br>
This week should be a breeze...except for Monday. I really need to do something for my Critical Thinking class because I've been really lax in there. It just seems really easy, and I probably should practice, but I don't want to! What a dilemma...<br>
<br>
Well, that's all for now, I shall sleep soon, and work on the site later...goodnight all!

<p>I forgot to put something down here last night, so I make up for it thus by writing now at 11:08 on Tuesday orning. I had an excellent workout despite my leg pains returning, once again, after what seemed like 4 laps. I think that this is happening because I must be working some muscle in my legs when I do the lower AB crunches, and, until it is better, I won't be able to do my 5 mile run...sad. My spring break body is only 5 weeks away!<br>
<br>
Oh, Missy is making some exciting plans for Spring Break! We have plans to stay in a luxurious high-rise in Seagrove between Destin and Panama City. We will have access to our own beach, out party destination, and the beautiful Seaside. I am thinking I can make this one of the most fun Spring Breaks EVER! This will definitely be a college spring break! Costs are quite high, however, and I have let my mom know that ANY help would be appreciated...I mean, they could give me a little, that would be great, maybe not the whole thing...<br>
<br>
Well, today...have classes...SPANISH TEST...New Buffy episode...running MAYBE...buh bye!

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday February 14th<br><div align="right">...VALENTINE'S DAY!</div></h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Here I am soldiering through another senseless Critical Thinking lecture. Suffering through rants about the ambiguities of the English language as well as aspirations to find the specific claim of a deductive argument. This day is particularly nasty because I am sandwiched between a know-nothing valley girl and a psychotic cologne drenched loser. This cologne is especially pungent, as I am reminded of it's horrible presence every five seconds...oh will this day ever end.<br>
<br>
I am uneasy about the SGA elections this week. I see annoying Sachin and Cherry campaigners on every corner, but they seem to be uneasy about approaching me. Is it something about how I'm walking? Just because I'm listening to my wonder garbage, you can't tell me about how Sachin and Cherry can make my life complete? Is it because I'm not a blond, built frat guy or a thoughtless blond sorority girl? Do I have to have chiseled good looks or D cup breasts to seem approachable? What is the deal here! I'm certainly seeing exactly how much diversity Sachin and Cherry have to present the students here at the University<br>
<br>
Valentine's Day was very nice this year. I received a thoughtful Valentine from my good friend Leena mentioning my wonderful crush on that adorable Nathan Smorynski. It's too bad his website isn't that interesting. He seems to have an affinity towards He-man toys and skateboarding. It's quite boring and a vacuum in my Favorites File on my browser. Anyways, I got Missy and Gen both a rose today and was very happy that I did so. I figure that was a nice gesture. The two girls I love the most here, I got to make their Valentine's Day somewhat special. I'm proud of that.<br>
<br>
Well, I'm very tired now...I really need to get to bed. I beat Super Mario World tonight! It came out on Game Boy Advance this week and I had to buy it. Now I can play around with it for fun, I guess. It's really a toy for drunk-Missy when she's in need of entertainment. Well, goodnight for now!

<p>Well, it's 3:03 on this early Saturday morning. I had a failing academic day today. I neglected to do my Reading Questions for English, which was a horrible discrepancy on my part. I also proceeded to skip this class as well as my Linguistics class...I'm sure that this was definatly a mistake, but I will manage. I had an altogether non-productive day. I should have gone running, but my shin splint fears overcame me. I will go tomorrow...first thing, I promise. Then lunch.<br>
<br>
I had an entertaining night with Missy tonight. We started our night by going to Bolton, where we did NOT run into Greg...oh thank heavens...because when I run into that waste of space, I just get so upset...it's like I know he's such a liar and a two-faced coward and I just hate him for it, but I have to pretend he's not there...and I'm usually very good at that. Well, we then proceeded to shit-mobile and found that it was DEAD. Yes, my battery had run dead. With the help of Missy's mustang, Mazda was teeming with new life...and was very &quot;TURNED ON&quot; by Mustang's intervention...<br>
<br>
We then proceeded to spend an hour at Blockbuster deciding what movies we would rent for the Movie Night. We settled on <i>Blue Lagoon</i> because of it's very sexual themes. Afterwards, we saw a very interesting TV News program about social stratification and how it starts in public schools. I was very intrigued by this. Missy did some surveys on the computer, and we then decided to go see <i>The Neverending Story</i> at Tate.<br>
<br>
Watching a corny 80's movie with a bunch of college insomniacs transformed this relatively innocent film into a very perverse and sexual movie. It was a hoot! We really enjoyed ourselves...Tate movies are alot of fun. Well, I am tired and I must take a long nap...tomorrow I have much to do. I will cya later, buh bye!

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, February 16th<br><div align="right">APRIL'S BIRTHDAY</div></h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Happy Birthday April.<br>
<br>I had a nice day today...it was failing as well. I did not run, for shame...I'm such a loser. I didn't work on my website like I had planned, which has forced me to delay it. All I need to do is make some of my friends some pages...which I have finally grown too sick of doing. If any of my friends want a site, they are going to have to ask for it. No more begging for content...I will just do my normal journal and maybe add poems and lyrics now and then.<br>
<br>
Missy and I went out to AMF tonight, which I found to be very boring. She got to dance with a guy, who I thought was not very cute at all. Poor drunk-Missy is not a good judge of character...oh well. It was a distraction, so I enjoyed it.<br>
<br>
Stuff about the update...A theme change, FLASHBACK TO VERSION 2.0...Links Page...New Poems UP SOMETIME SUNDAY...GAY Friends UP SOMETIME SUNDAY...Garbage B-side Lyrics UP SOMETIME SUNDAY...maybe pictures? No, not this time. Soon, when I feel less ugly.
