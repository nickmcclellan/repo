<p>Oh, Friday sucked ass...well, I didn't plan on doing much for Friday. I rented a movie and watched it with the roomie. I was hoping I could watch something fun with Missy, but she had decided to go to see a movie with Gen. However, Gen got in an accident on the way to the movie, and they ended up watching <i>Blow</i> with me and Matt. We went out to get drinking accessories for Missy, and on the way back, she mentioned that she would not be adverse to going to Boneshakers, and I jumped at the chance.<br>
<br>
I decided that I should drink, so I had tons of Vodka. It was not a good idea. I had it way too fast, but not enough to get me really hammered and passed out, but enough to get me really strange, like I was walking on clouds or something. We went out, but Missy couldn't walk very well, so we ended up having to go back to her dorm. We did this, and Gen took me up to my room, and I proceeded to bed, still very drunk. I woke up covered in vomit...<br>
<br>
Ok, I don't know what the fuck happened. I remember going taking out my contacts and going to bed properly, but sometime during the night I threw up. It was so disgusting, and I spent the whole day Saturday getting my room back into shape. On the way to Wal-Mart, I got pulled over by a cop! I was alittle more concerned with the vomit all over my room, so I didn't pay much attention to it. It turns out it's going to cost $100.<br>
<br>
Well, I'm sure I'll be alright, just alittle live and learn and THANK GOD I made through it alive. 3 more weeks of school and I head home...and I might go on hiatus on this journal seeing that I won't have the high speed connection. We'll see...
