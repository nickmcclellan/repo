<p>Well, I am off and running on my new summer life. I have started a diet that will center around rice. I am staying away from Food Avenue at Target so I don't go out of control with the fatty foods. I think I need to impose a significant exercise program, but I'm not sure how that will materialize without the advantages such a facility like Ramsey would offer in Athens.<br>
<br>
Besides restarting my job at Target, I've been kinda sick this week. It started with a mild sore throat along with some annoying nasal congestion. I then developed an ear ache, which is pretty rare for me. I went to the doctor on Thursday before I went into work that night and got some meds. It's very annoying, I can assure you. I was just seek a few weeks ago with a nasty flu, why should I suffer again??? When I get the answer, I'll be sure to tell you.<br>
<br>
Got to see April on Wednesday, which was nice. I guess my whole cold shoulder approach to her just melted away at the realization that I would be hanging out with my best friend. I don't think I will be able to get alot of quality Nick/April time in this summer, but I'll take what I can get. I want to wish her and Matt much congrats on their upcoming 10th month anniversary...though I think they should save the celebration until the year anniversary...who cares about the 10th month anyways??? I mean, maybe some celebratory sex, but nothing more...<br>
<br>
I ended my semester at UGA in EXCELLENT shape. I got 3 A's and 1 B, just as I had hoped. I would have preferred to get all A's, but Bitch Reynolds could never yield that sweet letter to me...NEVER! Well, I'm thankful that even after an embarrassing first test score of a 52 I gracefully recovered with a B. I am also glad I was able to pull off a great final in ENGL2310...I know Provost probably had to give me some slack somewhere, and I'm thankful. I will definitely not let my cockiness interfere with my grades next year.<br>
<br>
Sigh, not much to do now...just sleep and work. Nothing interesting, and no prospects for a relationship with anyone meaningful. Lily asked me yesterday if I had made any &quot;meaningful relationships&quot; and I kinda wished I could answer, &quot;No, I haven't found a guy that's really worth my time...or I'm just not worth there's.&quot; I think this summer will definitely be my coming out at Target. It's unavoidable at this point. But hey, who knows? I could find Mr. Right working behind that Electronics boat...under my nose the whole time! ;-D<br>
<br>
Please read &quot;The Garfield Monologue&quot; and let me know what you think. I know it isn't perfect, but I think I'm going to keep in its original form. I tried to fix some of the ackward/dumb parts, but I just couldn't keep its original message. Please let me know what you think...I have got ZERO e-mail feedback about my website. You gotta let me know!<br>
<br>
BTW, I SAW GARBAGE LIVE ON SUNDAY, IT FUCKING ROCKED!!! VOW WAS AMAZING LIVE!!!
