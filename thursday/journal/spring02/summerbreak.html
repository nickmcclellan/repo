<p>Well, it is very nice to finally have been completely freed of all my obligations back in Athens. I'm living my own life on my own terms now, meaning that I am just going to work and doing really whatever my selfish heart desires. I have been working every day since last Thursday, but luckily I got my first day off on Wednesday. Last night at 12:02, I got to see Star Wars Episode 2, and it was very enjoyable. If you want my opinion, it wasn't as good as it could have been. It's full of Star Wars type thrills and tons of political intrigue. It's interesting trying to find out who is the bad guy, because that is very difficult. I think that George Lucas is saving the big surprises until Episode 3, which, because of lack of development this time around, will be where Anakin Skywalker becomes Darth Vader. All in all, I thought it was an excellent film, you'll definitely want to check it out.<br>

I helped out my bored cousin today and took a time-filler trip to Helen GA. We're going to visit in a few weeks for a nice camping trip, which should be like the last time we went to Helen. We had a nice time last year river tubing, and it would great to go again...

<p>Well, just finished up the update for this week. The trip to Helen is not a trip to Myrtle Beach, and we are going at the end of the week. My cousin is dealing with some heavy issues involving her family, so she's staying over for a while, and we are happy to have her. Well, I really don't have much to say...all I have to say is check out the garbage b-sides, the will be coming out with a b-side album at the end of this year...CHECK IT OUT MAN!
