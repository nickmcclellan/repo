<p>Hello, it's me again...without a whole lot to say as it seems. I'm being so lazy lately, but alot did happen this week, so I had better keep you all up to date.<br>
<br>
This week was horrible test week. My fight with Reynolds came to a head this week as I sunk my teeth into the second short exam of the semester. I think I did really well! My paper was excellent, I did a bang-up job on it, yep yep. I know I got one of the identifications wrong, but I'm hoping that that was it.<br>
<br>
I also had my Critical Thinking test this week. I'm very worried about that. I am thinking that I could have really screwed up some crucial problems. That could result in some major point losses. I just hope that whenever Harrison decided to return these that I will have a grade I can work with.<br>
<br>
I went home this weekend, and I have to say I did enjoy it. I got to spend some time with both mom and dad, and I got lotion, soap, and a nice pair of running shoes out of it...not to mention a wonderful Sunday dinner. I figure that maybe new running shoes will help with those damn shin splints. I'm working out hard-core for the next two weeks. This weekend, I realized just how close I am to achieving the ADEQUATE spring break bod. Oh yes, I'm going to love this spring break, yes I will.<br>
<br>
Hopefully next week I will have a better journal, but that's how things are going as we speak...so apologies all around, I will be back soon, hopefully. Another week of tests and a weekend of essay writing awaits. LAURYN HILL ON SATURDAY, I AM SO EXCITED! POSSIBLY <b>BETTER</b> THEN GARBAGE, SHE IS SO INCREDIBLE! Well, I will let you all know exactly how that goes...PROMISE, cya lata, buh bye!
