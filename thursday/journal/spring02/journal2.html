In this Blog retrospective, I point out some of the more interesting times of my first year at UGA. I came out. I met some of the most amazing people with whom I'm still friends with. And most importantly, I created this website. If you don't feel like combing through several various individual entries, then sit back, and take a look at this one. It's got everything that's worth knowing.</td>
