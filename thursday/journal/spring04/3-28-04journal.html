<img border="0" src="inuicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Many apologies for what will certainly be the dinkiest update I've had since I started the site, but I have a credible excuse!  On Sunday night my computer fizzled and died for the second time.  The first time, of course, was mentioned in the Fall 2002 memorable journal entry <a href="../fall02/11-10journal.html">"Crashed"</a> (which was intended to be named "Aloof" and was a bit more substantive than it looks in its current state).  Well, I took the bus to the mall on Monday and dropped off the worthless sack of metal at GC Computers.  I finally got it back last night (thank to Kyle for taking me out to the mall) and spent all night moving back into it.  Right now I'm taking a break from auditing my website...a whole world of boredom you'd probably not want to hear about.</p>
<p>My computer's name is "nick" now, and it was the nice technician at GC Computers who named it for me.  My dearly departed Amnisiac has gone onto the big computer heaven in the sky...oh, he will be missed.  I've not lost too much (I learned alot from the first crash when I lost Shitcomputer).  I've been backing up my mp3's every couple months, so I probably lost a minimal amount of music.  Maybe 10 songs.  I've backed up past word files, but fortunatly the ones I didn't back up the guy at GC Computers was able to recover.  Also, he recovered all my jpgs (way too many jpgs...) and I was able to save my My Pictures folder (which really had a bunch of replaceable pictures of Shirley Manson and a few semi-valuable personal pictures).  So yah, I have probably about a week of restoring, and everything should be good as new :-D</p>
<p>So, yah, how did I endure this week of Computerlessness?!  Well, let's say it wasn't easy.  Turns out the Internet IS my news source, and when I was struggling to find out how the SR 595 came out, I had to flip between TV channels instead of watching the debate and vote live on the Net.  Yah, that was annoying (and the outcome of the vote as well).  Also, I couldn't go to my staple sites until my all-too-brief visits to the Lambda Office.  Sigh...at least I made it.</p>
<p>Well, while I was unplugged this week, I guess it was a so-so week of unproductivity.  Padmini's birthday was Tuesday, and it sucked that I couldn't give her my hyped present :-(  I "recovered" the present though, so I guess that's her only clue ;-)  It was a nice night...I went w/ Jerm who I miss alot.  So many miles of separation, things seemed so simple when he was across the quad and a skip to Snelling away.  Living off campus has its disadvantages, certainly.  Anyways, I wish he was around in the summer...I would like to hang out with him before he's even farther away.</p>
<p>Hmmm, anything interesting that happened this week...nothing really.  I'm one step closer to the only internship I applied for.  More on that when good news (or bad) comes in.  Wouldn't it be fun to write in London...</p>
<p>Uh, I think I'll take another icecream sandwich break from the recovering...I promise a better Blog next week!  Bear with me Genevieve ;-)
