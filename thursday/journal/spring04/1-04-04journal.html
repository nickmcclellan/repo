<p>Alot of people are already back, I imagine.  Athens will be bustin' from its seems come Thursday, the first day of classes.  All those endless hoards of college students, stuffed with calorie-ridden dinners and snacks from home, on their way back to the Classic City--to learn.  At the University, that old place where they make you buy books, they have lots of big buildings, and the buses that drive by very loud and overcrowded.  They're coming back to UGA, where surely President Michael Adams will have a better year.  There will be Gym Dawgs and Basketball, and parties (eh Missy ;-)  We come here because we have to.  There's school, your future, the reason you're really there.  But then there's that other thing.  The real reason.  It's better here.  You never want to leave, you always want to come back.</p>
<p>Surely the parties aren't that great.  Alcohol gets really gross after a while, the endless cycle.  Drink, drink, *blurry*, drink, drink, *WEE-OOO*, drink, chug, blech!  What keeps us wanting to come back to those quizzes and papers and exams?  Is it the people?  Are Missy and Genevieve really that interesting?  Sure, one's really sexy in the scandelous dress and the other one has an addicting attraction to burritos, but it's a big world, there are other people.  But we keep coming back, over and over, when it's good, when it's bad, we keep coming, and when it's over, we don't want to leave.  When we do, we're surprised that we don't want to.  Our purpose has lead us through four years, shouldn't we want to live a life outside of this nursery for grown idiots?  This is just a stop on the road, right?  When do we start moving again?  Is it in 2005?  I guess I could wait and see.  I'm sure life will pick me up and throw me somewhere new.  I could wait until I'm thrown, but that's what I'm sick of.  Waiting.</p>
<p>Maybe this is an empty resolution, like all the others.  This will end like it has begun.  Me sitting at the computer, staring at something that will never be, though I want it to be.  I want it.</p>
<p>Simple as that, I want it.  Maybe not as much as I want to go back, but I want it, and this semester will be proff to me just how far I'm willing to get it.  I can't help but think of high school, and how much I <i>didn't</i> want to go back.  I think of that and see how good all that misery made me feel.  That one moment in the crowd, gathered on the football field, standing next to a guy that made me feel like absolute hell, and throwing my cap into the air in a grand display of defiance against him and everything that made that place a hell for me.</p>
<p>That was great, and it felt good.  Like I wrote a few days ago, I don't feel good about myself.  I want to feel better.  I want to focus on some of the things that I've neglected and focus less on the things that I keep coming back to.  This place is nice, it has the incredible ability to make me feel better, even pretty damn good at some times, but there's no pride.  No validation.  It's empty, and it will stay that way if I don't do something about.</p>
<p>Thus, here I am.  Writing.  The one thing that makes me feel good.  This year, I have two New Year's resolutions:
<ul>
<li>To work hard to get myself out of Athens.</li>
<li>To run two miles a day</li>
<li>To function successfully on a budget</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, everyone has their "get fit!" resolution, but I know I can do it!  It's one mile from my house to Gaines School and one mile from Gaines School back, so I really just have to run down the road.  Simple!</p>
<p>I forget what my resolution was last year.  I think I just wanted to come back to Athens so bad, it was all I could see.  The year before, I was hoping a second semester at UGA would in some way be more interesting than the first.  This time, I may realize it's all the same.  Maybe if I actually do something different this time, things will work out.</p>
<p>So, this semester, I expect to hopefully get an internship for the summer.  I'd like to get a job (contingent on the nature of the internship).  I'm probably going to get rid of my car.  Website-wise, I'd like to make a shitmobile page as a send off to, well, the shitmobile.  I'd also like to make friends pages for Mary-Kate and Laura (sexy sorority girl).  I want to have another party, definitely one in celebration of whether or not I win my noise-ordinance trial on January 26th.  It will be a quiet party, God-damnit!  We'll just get drunk and pass out (quietly).</p>
<p>That's enough for today...</p>
<p align="center"><i>"Your hands didn't move, well neither did mine!<br>
New Year's will bring me to you<br>
I'm waiting to give you whatever the world may bring<br>

<div class="post">
<p>I got Matt's present today.  Since this won't be published until after he recieves it, I can say I got him the first DVD set to <i>Are You Being Served?</i>, a Britcom that he and I like (but have never had the opportunity to watch).  We always watch Buffy together, so this will give us an opportunity to watch something he really enjoys.  I also got him a teddy bear with colored chocolate and a pylon, A PYLON!!!  THAT'S RIGHT!  It's not a cone, it's a pylon! (I just had another urge to type "God-damnit," I don't want this to become a habit, I really don't like taking the Lord's name in vain :-x).</p>
<p>In other news, Jeremy has been converted to vegetarianism.  It's a sad day.  I mean, yah, innocent cows saved from slaughter, but what about what we've lost?  All that deliciousness?  Does anyone care?  Hmmm, I guess not.  It's a good thing, the eating of only vegetables.  Maybe, one day, if they have some kind of veggie burger that doesn't taste like damp bread, I'll too embrace our green foodstuffs.  Go potato!

<p>This house is cold.  I don't think I'd like to come here anymore.  From the pipe-cleaner Christmas tree to the man who can't live outside of his computer screen or pocket book, this place has become an empty, miserable house of bottom lines and boredom.  I guess it's true.  You really can't ever go home.</p>
<p>Boneshakers tonight.  Missy said something funny today.  Something about prefering sex to staying at home.  I laughed alot (you'd have to be there).  I got my Buffy CD's.  Spent my waking hours of the afternoon after my day-of-inventory at Rich's organizing the tracks on my computer.  My favorite song is "Blue" by Angie Hart.  Very cool...</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, January 8th...HAPPY BIRTHDAY MELISSA!</h2>
<div class="post">

<p>So, I'm back in Athens, and OH! what a feeling.  Last night couldn't have been more appropriate.  I mean, what the fuck, things always start off so hackneyed with Missy about.  So, I pulled up to my house in my shitty ass car at 8:30 and started to unpack only the really fun things that I brought back home with me (computer included, I mean, this thing is tied to my hip).  I was kinda hungry and stuff, but I waited around talking to Missy online and Gen too.  It gots to abouts 9 p.m. so I called Matt who was at Molly's w/ John and some folks (including long lost Andrew!)  Well, he wanted me to come on down, but I wanted to pre-party at Missy's, so after some negotiating, I was dooped into venturing to the liquor store to get some pink champagne for Missy.  I also got some beef process from McDonalds because, if you noticed from what I wrote, I was hungry.  I came to Missy's and saw this really cool picture that Noa took of me, her, and Missy.  I didn't get any beef process on the picture, I'll just have you know...</p>
<p>Well, Missy was getting all ready, and John and folks showed up (including Matt in black pants...which I said I didn't like, but not because he was wearing them, just that I don't like black pants).  Well, I started the drinking, and I don't remember being too annoying at the time.  I think I may have made out w/ Missy or something scandelous, nothing new.  Well, Ben Martin (last Spring's potential roommate) was there, and he really wanted to go to Bones, so they all went on ahead while Missy and I talked to Noa.  I also had another drink (good times!)  Noa took us on down to Bones in Missy's shiny recently repaired car, and we went on inside.</p>
<p>Oh, Boneshakers.  You are too dramatic, and you have too many people.  I walked in and saw everyone, everyone I knew and probably should have said hello to.  It's a rush, seeing everyone all over again.  I was just alittle too buzzed to care about anyone else but Missy, so we went straight to the dance floor.  Oh, what fun, I can dance with that one all night (I did once).  We parted ways, and I saw some people.  Missy got some drinks.  Apparently Kristin has a new girlfriend, Chastidy.  Both scorned by Nic...that's sad.  Don't you hate ex's?  I mean, some are alright, granted, but there is always one that you just can't stand.  You either let them in too far or they were just so deluded into thinking they were a meaningful part of your life, that you get really repulsed.  I'm assuming this was the "let them too far in" variety of ex spite.</p>
<p>So, one thing led to another.  Seeing some people led me to call Rachel (who I will call again Sunday).  After finishing our conversation, Missy came to me.  She proceeded to climb the spotlight platform on the porch of Boneshakers!  I foolishly followed, and then she went onto the roof!  Once again, monkey see, monkey do.  <i>We're on the roof of Boneshakers!</i>  George Morgan walks out of the bar, and Missy and I have to shush up and get down so he doesn't see us...<i>on the roof!</i>  So I saw some lawnchairs that some drunks had put on the roof at some point in the last year, so I proceeded to throw them down (very loudly) and the two white ones broke.  Missy threw a green one :-*  Well, after a little bit, we decided to get down.  It was a beautiful night to spend on the roof of a gay bar with Missy.  I was afraid we'd fall through the roof...<i>that</i> would be funny!</p>
<p>Ok, yah, we went inside and danced some more.  I danced w/ Matt, and fortunatly vegetables make him warm, he was so warm!  Very nice having the warm boyfriend variety.  Yah, at this point I got tired and Missy got randy w/ the new bouncer.  She got his number.  She confessed to me that she prefers this, it puts her in a situation of control.  And I think...she's sexy.</p>
<p>Second moment of the evening!  Yes, two moments already, and it's already the first day...  Well, Missy wore <i>high heel</i> shoes to Boneshakers.  Yes.  I'll repeat.  <i>High heel shoes to BONESHAKERS!</i>  We were walking back to Steeplechase and she was in alot of pain, so I proceed to give her a piggy-back ride, it was so cute!  There's Missy on my back, her legs wrapped tight around my waist, her pointy-ass high heel shoes jutting out in front of me, us running down the hill at Pulaski street, and people start honking at us!  Yes, she kept sliding down my leather jacket, I had to adjust frequently.  I was so wore out when we got in that I couldn't take her up three flights of stairs.  I'm inadequate :-(</p>
<p>Well, I went to bed and then it was Thursday!  First day of classes!  Missy and I walked to school and I was suddenly reminded of <i>The Jetsons</i> and the song popped in my head.  Missy walked away from me, and I imagined I was George, handing her the money and she grabs my wallet.  "Jane, his wife!"  My classes for Tuesday/Thursday are not that bad.  Spanish started off in the worst possible way ever--forming groups for our semester presentation.  Isn't that a second class day activity at the very least?  It was really bizarre, my Spanish class.  More or less the same students, same teacher, same <i>room</i> as my SPAN2002 class in the Spring of my freshman year.  I got an A then, I'll get an A now!</p>
<p>As for now, it's cold in this house.  I'm going to continue to unpack, make my to-do list, and maybe do some of the to-do things!  I hope this entry finds everyone well.  I really enjoyed writing it, I had a really awesome time last night.  Hope you all did too!

<p>Seems I will be doing something that I've been wanting to do since I was very young.  At last, free.  Completely free from all of it.  This year may be very good, it's important that I keep my eyes on the page.  Can't let this one go, or, you know, I will be having to make other arrangements.</p>
<p>So, I think this week is one of the best Blogs I've ever written.  It's all pretty and it's got those new visual elements.  So creative.  Making this was a joy.  I'm really interested to see what happens this time around.  So many things up in the air.  That new big change.  The exeunt of the shitmobile.  The Honors Thesis.  "December."  A new garbage album (which, I'd just like to warn everyone, if that ever materializes, you can expect a whole Blog to review it).  And, you know, other things.  A whole parade of changes, and it's coming, and I can't help but smile because I'm home now.  I don't want to go anywhere, just stay here in my room.  All day.</p>
<p>I don't think that's possible, but it would be nice.  I hope everyone likes the first blog...plenty more to come, for sure.  I guess I'll update regularly, but maybe after Spring Break I may opt for the Sunday updates only.  It seemed so simple then.  Less dramatic.  I'm sick of living in the fishbowl anyways.</p>
<p>Ok, until next time...
