<img border="0" src="spnick.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>My computer is being very strange.  I move it an inch, and suddenly "Stacy's Mom" starts to skip and scream like blue screen of death is coming from the grave for vengence.  I think the several fixes over the last year have screwed with some of the screws in my computer, so maybe I should make an effort to fix these issues.  I'll add it to my to-do list.</p>
<p>Yes, I've got one.  I think it will help with that whole "New Year's Project" thing I'm all into.  Maybe if I stay focus on some specifics, I'll know for sure at the end of the day whether or not I'm accomplishing anything.  Right now, I have everything in a sloopy mess-of-a-list in my Sherry Cherry notebook (yes, there's a Sherry Cherry notebook).  I think I'll have to get a little sketch pad for these to-do lists...that would be studious.</p>
<p>In music related news, I've become incredibly anal with the organization of my mp3's on my computer.  I have everything organized by album, group, or the general category "Other Music."  It's a big mess, but it makes sense in my non-sensical head.  I put the album April got me last year in my computer, one by My Bloody Valentine.  It's really strange stuff, and I'm trying really hard to get into it, but it's hard when you can't even hear the girl sing.  It's just noise, very difficult to understand.  It's different though, and I like that.</p>
<p>Matt's going to New York this week on a whim trip with Barry.  I don't like this and I told him why.  It's a sticky point of contention, I suppose.  Maybe he'll get me one of those "I HEART N Y" shirts.  That would be something I suppose.  I could wear it under my new Express jacket that he hates.  It was $15 from $185, what was I supposed to do?!  It's warm, what more can I ask for?</p>
<p>Oh, I should probably go to sleep.  I'm going to try and ride my bike to school in the morning at 8 a.m.  Wish me luck.  I think I'll listen to "Bizarre Love Triangle" now and watch <i>The Sunday Night Sex Show</i>.  I only wish that one day, years from now, I'll know half as much Sue knows about sex, because that would be very entertaining.

<img border="0" src="evilwillow.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I've done everything I need to do today except the homework :-/  Yah, I know, I should probably be studious, but I'm just so hungry!  I ran around all day doing things and I let some stranger take my leather jacket, and it was scary because he looked like some teenage dirtbag who would probably forget to tell them to sow buttons.  How am I supposed to work with this?!</p>
<p>Um, so I organized my notebooks.  This should keep me from using the, um, yah, that OTHER notebook (I already mentioned what notebook it was).  Maybe my notes won't be pencil smeared messes like last semester.  I also got a printer carthride so that I won't have big dilemmas in prining, like this morning.  Everytime I TOUCH Missy's computer, it is a source of aggrivation for me.  I swear, it's like the vein in my forehead juts out and I'm about to turn green and throw that piece of Dell-shit into the wall.  I don't know about purple pants, do you think it would go with my green jacket?  No.  No, it won't.  Matt hated it, so I had to take it back.  And it was so warm...</p>
<p>I had an incredibly creative idea today.  In honor of the impending departure of the shitmobile, I think I will write a wholeweek of Blog titled "Ode to the Shitmobile."  In it, I would write 7 actual classical odes to my shitty car.  I could use them in my ENGL4800 class, I bet alot of people would enjoy them, and I could use them on my shitmobile webpage (coming soon :-D).</p>
<p>So, I'm going to make some food.  I don't know what I want...so full of conversation hearts.  Best candy EVER.

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, January 15th...12:19 a.m.</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I need to find a new Boneshakers buddy.  I'm all into going out and being social, but all my Boneshakers friends are lame.  I want to go with Missy, but I understand why she wouldn't want to go.  It's a gay bar on a Wednesday, and I have so much fun with her when she does go, but I can't expect to say jump and she jumps everytime.  These things should happen occasionally.  And Gen, she's all 8 a.m. this semester and apparently not as into pool as I hoped she'd be.  Shouldn't lesbians have some sort of attraction to cues?  Oh, and I won't even mention the Fellows.  We didn't come to Athens to go to school, we came to watch gay boys get drunk, take off their shirts, and be all slutty so we can giggle and point.  Or something like that...</p>
<p>In other news, I ran alot today.  Coincidently, the first time I ran in a while.  I guess I started that whole 2 miles a day thing at last.  I was so tired this afternoon, I took a nap.  I'll probably be sore for a little bit.  Maybe running tomorrow...or riding the bike home.  Yah, or both.</p>
<p>I think I'll lay in bed for now.  The shadows will be my friends...or I'll watch Inuyasha.

<img border="0" src="lilyface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Today was a depressing day, or at least it started out that way.  I didn't talk to anyone all day long.  Matt was the first person I talked to (baring the brief presentación meeting with my friends from Spanish).  I dwelled on campus for a while this morning, finally opting to ride my bike home based solely on the fact that I wanted to take Lexington home, figured it would be different.  God knows that Research Dr. hill is TOO much for me at times.</p>
<p>I won't be heading to Heidi tomorrow, unfortunatly.  Not sure what the weekend holds.  Does it matter?  I have to prepare for that presentación.  I'm meeting with Stef Monday about the Valentine's Dance.  Maybe Missy will want to go to Blackout night?  Probably not after I refused to party with her tonight.  Oh, I bet Molly's would have been fun.  I should act more like a college student at the legal age of drinking.  I mean, it's cold out, isn't it?  January and all...  I'm all without my leather jacket until Tuesday.  It's going to be all clean and costing me thirty-some dollars.  Oh, joy.</p>
<p>For now, sleep. (I made a delicious spaghetti dinner tonight.  I'll remember that for some time, spendid!)</p>

<img border="0" src="ylsfshirl.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Last night, I went to Matt's apartment and just hang out with him and his friend Thomas.  Thomas is very interesting.  He doesn't like Lambda, and honestly <i>I</i> don't like Lambda that much either.  He went into all these reasons why it was bad and basically gave me the same old story from all those queers are are UN-Lambda, and I've heard it before.  Sure, I can see his point though.  He's really nice, I'm going to try to be all inclusive instead of all, "You're someone else's friend...not mine."</p>
<p>I told Matt today that I wish I would have put more time into the Red & Black instead of into Lambda.  This semester I'd like to write an article a week, and I know that would be really hard to do, but I think it could score me a staff position next year?  In the fall maybe?  I can go places with that, and though I can still go places with Lambda (some places), I think it may be the wrong place for me.  Activism is not my bag baby.  I could give a shit about gay marriage and adoption, I don't know what these things are, why do I need them?  If I want to get married, I'll get married, someday, somehow.  If I want a child, I will get a child.  Someday, somehow.  It's really not an issue for me at the moment.</p>
<p>So, yah, Lambda isn't my best friend, so please let that be known.  Last night I also go French Toast.  Yum :-p  And, um, other things, I don't remember.  Marilia said alot of fun one-liners.  Oh, what do you think of my new Shirl icon?  It's from the "You Look So Fine" video, I love it.  It's my background.  I haven't had alot of new backgrounds.  I'm going to be better about getting those.  More scouring of the Internet.</p>
<p>Anyways, Filter seemed appropriate, so I'll leave you with that.</p>
