<img border="0" src="vendettaface.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>My weekend could aptly titled, "Trembling in the Driver's Seat of the Shitmobile," because my complete lack of social interaction is blamed on that damn right front tire (Wow, isn't that a band or a song or something?)  Wow, I had dreams last night that everything was fine and I could easily use the car to get my leather jacket on Tuesday (oh, smooth leather...I miss you), but I believe it's just Satan from the pits of hell trying to lull me into a false sense of security so he can leave me stranded at the foot of O-house.</p>
<p>Yes, I believe that's where it's going to happen.  I'm going to block bus traffic and be gawked at by hundreds of passer-bys, all immature teething freshman, laughing and mocking my miserable shitmobile.  Oh, how I <i>dread</i> that day.  It's fortunate I have a bike.  I'm going to be so buff come Spring Break.  Today I have to meet Stef at 4 to talk about stuff.  She was trying to talk to me on AIM, but I was being pelted by those last night AND talking to Marilia in real time.  It's hard to talk through fingers.  In other news, I liked the <i>L-Word</i>, I thought it was very sexy.  It's like, I know about gay men because <i>I am one</i>, but I'm not a lesbian, so it's intriguing to see their lives, their loves, and their <i>sexy intimate scenes</i>!</p>
<p>Um, I think I'll try to do something more social this week.  Last night I got to see Kyle, Maggie, and Jerm.  That's social, and I can tell I'm expanding as we speak!  I wish there was an opportunity at a good party (you know, the one where people actually have friends and don't have to con people into coming through listservs and drunken kidnappings).  A good party...I just don't know where to find one of those.  I suppose I'll have to take responcibility in throwing one.  Definitely if I win the noise ordinance trial.  If not, then I'll throw a party w/ a cover charge.  Yah...I'll do the twenty keg thing with all the alcohol you could ever imagine.  And I'm sure Missy would provide the entertainment.</p>
<p>I'll leave to make some French Toast or something, but before I go, I just wanted to share something funny that happened to Missy last week.  Turns out her trick from Thursday crushed, killed, and destroyed Missy's laptop's AC power cord and she's got to pay a hundred plus dollars to replace it.  Since this, Missy has opted to start dating guys.  I mean, this time, when her trick rips apart something precious, she at least gets a lobster dinner out of it.  God I love that girl.</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Uh, it was tough today.  I missed the bus and had to ride my bike to school before class started.  I sat staring at my watch seeing the gauntlet that had been thrown down before me.  Thirty minutes.  6 miles.</p>
<p>So, I walked into Park Hall drenched.  I prefer not to think what I must have looked like.  I hope the sweating and panting was sexy.  God knows I'll be that buff adonis come Spring Break.  I have to be.  So much damn misery for nothing, that would be a shame.</p>
<p>The Lambda Office is open.  As far as I know, running smoothly.  I won't be seeing my mother this weekend, I'll be slumming it in Athens.  I only pray there will be a party.  I have been desperate to do something fun.  Something irresponcible.  Maybe tonight I'll have my opportunity.</p>
<p>If I'm not roof walking this evening, hopefully they'll play The Darkness or something.  Just have to get out.

<img border="0" src="homsar.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>Thank goodness the constant naucious feeling has faded.  I suppose I got over the dizziness around 4 or 5 today.  It's a good thing I read the things for my classes, eh, you know, since I didn't go to them.  And I'm really glad I didn't ride Missy's bike home because I think my burrito from last night would have ended up on the side of Barnett Shoals.</p>
<p>Yes, I got my drunken craziness that I've been craving for so long.  To my surprise, Missy was up for a night out, which I really appreciate since I'm still missing my Boneshakers buddy.  Matt came along because he didn't have homework...or he did and already did it...or he didn't and forgot he didn't and wanted to say no just to upset me...well, anyways, he probably should keep a to-do list like me so he stays studious and informed :-D  We went to Missy's and I got some more of that New Year's Everclear that Matt bought.  I talked to Noa and gave Claire a massage and used Dayana's lotion.  I slowly sank into the throws of intoxication, selfishly taking Wintergreen Altoids and going on and on about Fink's newspaper class to Noa.  Yes, and then we went to Boneshakers.</p>
<p>Missy hooked up with the bouncer's friend.  How annoying, I wanted to dance w/ her.  I specifically remember being very torn over the not dancing and roof walking with her.  I probably was a real pain, I don't think anyone paid that much attention to me.  I can remember seeing a few people there I recognized, but mostly, I just paced back and forth looking for Matt and Missy.  Next time, no drinking on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>I woke up, still drunk, going on and on w/ Glory quotes and laughing alot.  I skipped class and Missy drove me home after she took home her trick.  Turns out her Wednesday night is helping to produce the new We Are The World Trade Center album.  He said the magic word!  He said it sounded like garbage, and all of a sudden I loved the guy.  He was cool.  Missy's all torn about the one-night-stand thing.  You know, the whole "Tonight, not tomorrow" aspect of Missy's sexcapades.  It's the name of the game, my friend.</p>
<p>I thought it was cute that her New Year's resolution was to date and not randomly hook up.  She made admirable strides yesterday evening.  She went to the basketball game with James on a sweet little date.  I don't blame her, it's like the patch, she's got to ween herself off the penis.  I figure by the end of the semester she'll be down to one or two Boneshakers bouncers a month, tops.</p>
<p>I just think it's amazing she got a guy in that dive.  I guess she learned from the best. B-)

<img border="0" src="cupofcoffee.jpg" align="left" hspace="5"><p>I'm sorry, but a failed attempt to sleep has me writing, well, more accuratly reading.  I'm at a McDonalds website looking for "food words."  Don't ask.  I'm trying to write a section for "December" called Cheeseburger.  You'll see.</p>
<p>I was thinking, why do I drink?  I was talking to Marilia today about someone I really don't like, someone I think I hate, and I went on about how this person drinks alot and drinks to run away from things and drinks to be an interesting, intriguing person, but I wonder, why do I drink?  What do I want from that feeling of dizzying disgust.  Why can't I be sober and talk to people?  What's so fun about falling asleep in a room that's spinning?</p>
<p>Maybe I'll get what I want when I'm drunk.  Until then, I'll vomit and giggle, and think.  I'll think about what people must think of me.</p>
<p>Anyways, I've found some disturbing McDonalds creations.  I had to share.</p>

<td align="left"><u>Amazing Burger Thai</u>:  With a specially produced TV commercial that captured the style of the famous Thai poem written by King Rama II, McDonald's Amazing Burger Thai advertising stayed true to promoting the Thai cultural essence.<br>
<br>
<u>McSpaghetti</u>:  A hearty and delicious Spaghetti served in a tangy Chicken Pomodoro sauce, the McSpaghetti is a great tasting Italian dish that will excite any pasta-lover!<br>
<br>
<u>Chicken SingaPorridge</u>:  A great-tasting, value-for-money breakfast, Chicken SingaPorridge is a smooth tasty porridge with a generous serving of 100% quality chicken pieces and garnishing such as freshly cut spring onions, red chili slices, ginger shreds and crispy shallots.<br>
<br>
<u>McSalmon Burger</u>:  In line with McDonald's maxim to "eat healthy, feel healthy and stay healthy", McDonald's introduced its second fish item, McSalmon Burger.<br>
<br>
<u>Love Burger</u>:  Coincidentally, the Love Burger promotion stretched from May to June, which are popular months for weddings.</font></div></td>

<br>
<p>Wow.  I mean, that says it.  I'd love to be married while eating my Love Burger and my beef process fries.  It's too bad May and June are so many months away.</p>
<p>Other than McDonalds quotes, I'll give you <a href="1-14-04missykt22.htm">this</a>.  I wanted to put together a good Missy/Nick IM conversation, and though I still had to edit some things we said about people that might read the blog, it still stands on its own.  That's enough for you now...
