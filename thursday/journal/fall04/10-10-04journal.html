<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, October 13th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="staykagomeicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I apologize for such a short week last week, and such a cryptic and ellusive title.  Take it to mean whatever you wish.  Maybe my life is going to hell.  Maybe it was midterms.  Maybe I'm broke, who knows.  All I can say is that the last few weeks, and even months, have been very different, and it has had me in so many ways stressed out of my mind.  I will explain it all sometime, but for now I'm going to keep quiet, at least here.  That's all I'll say for now, but there's more. That's coming someday.</p>
<p>This week is sort of a make-up for last week, which is sort of a make-up for the week before that, and so on.  I'm not doing my public affairs articles as fast as I'd like to.  I don't know, there's just something keeping me from all that.  I'm still plucking away on the binge drinking article, and I'm doing another debate article for tonight's debate.  Next week, I want to talk to Campus Ministry or something of the sort to see if any of the churches are doing anything about Amendment 1.  I find it incredibly interesting, not out of my own personal interests in the amendment, because I'm sure people can infer that.  What interests me most is democracy and the fact that people are going to choose to do this.  All things being equal, and assuming there isn't an election controversy this year, we're going to be the ones to blame for putting discrimination into the constitution, setting a powerful and dangerous precedent for prescriptive law.  It's not the politicians fault, it's not even the ministers and crazy sidewalk evanjelicals.  It's you and me.  We decided, or I should say, we decide.</p>
<p>Yah, so I can't wait until this election is over.  Once doofus A or B takes office, all this rhetoric will go away and I think things will be better.  I'd prefer Kerry to be in office, but I'm trying to accept the fact that a second term President Bush wouldn't be the end of the world.  Again, if he's elected, it means the majority (of electors) believed he was right for the job.  That can't be a bad thing, can it?  I don't know, anything to get my mind off this mess.</p>
<p>I went to see my sister Friday in Atlanta.  I finally gave her the fudge she left at my house when my mom came to visit.  I also returned her jacket that she left when she took me to get my teeth yanked out.  We went to the Cheesecake Factory, though I was not in the mood for much that night.  Her friend Tyler was alot of fun.  He always is.  They did this funny thing with butter and salt, and he asked Jennifer to feel the heat coming off because of the chemical reaction.  She was rightfully skeptical of Tyler's prank, so she asked him to do it first.  He did, and she quickly rushed her palm down to slam his into the butter, <i>but</i> the little bastard pulled away just in time to have my sister sitting there with a handful of salty butter.  It was really funny, even I had to laugh.</p>
<p>She told me about alot of Taco Mac people, and sadly it sounds very skanky there.  I won't name names, but aparently a certain girl is seeing another co-worker's husband.  It blows my mind, I'm so glad I'm not that dramatic.  Why someone would do that to someone else, I just don't know.</p>
<p>I got a one week extention on the website, and it's looking alot better now.  I might have to fool with the color scheme tomorrow, but it will be done Friday at 5 p.m.  I'm glad I didn't go in this direction with my real webpage, it's just too different for me.  It's nice and all, but my post-"Thursday" site is going to be alot lighter and it's going to take alot longer than a week to piece together.</p>

<p>Anyways, I'll do something productive now, maybe.  We'll just have to see about that, I guess.</p>

<p>Ok, here's another iPod update.  I'm guess now the real wait begins.  I hear that most of the problems come with ordering from the vendor because they can't keep the iPods in stock.  We'll see.  I'll give it 3 weeks, tops.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ipod3.jpg"></p>
<p>I had a strange moment the other day when I really wanted to have the iPod.  It will be nice not having to turn on my computer to listen to my mp3's.  They are so much fun to listen to...
