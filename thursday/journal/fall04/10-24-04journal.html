<div class="post">
<p><img border="0" src="kikyowadeicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">I'm feeling like days are the most pressing inconvenience.  I find them increasingly pointless, and I look forward to the time that I am sleeping in spite of them, or sleeping at the end of them.  I should be working on my articles, but I don't want to.  I don't want to, and I won't.  I want to sit here, maybe type this out, and then go upstairs and sleep on a chair.  I want to sit there and take whatever it is I'm supposed to take until it's time for something else, and whatever else after that, until it's time to rest again.</p>
<p>I feel like I'm just killing time.  I just want to feel noticed.  I want to feel honored, remembered, and respected.  In its absense, I feel pointless.  The gaping holes in the road that were once so easy to transverse are now pulling me into them.  I feel like I need help with this, but I don't know who to turn to.  They're either too far, too involved, or don't care whatsoever.  I feel like sheading the skin and every part of me to get back what has been taken from me.  I feel it's so important, I can't breathe without it.  I feel this loss is so pointless and unnecessary, that if I had one moment to trample the beast, it would be no more.  I feel surmounting this obstacle and putting it behind me will make all of these other diversions nothing more than daily nusances.  Despite my confidence, I am powerless to stop what is coming, and I don't know what to do because of it.</p>
<p>In this absense, I feel like a shell.  I know I should be stronger, and that I should demand more than this, but I am so willing to do anything I can for this person, that demanding his apology would only undermine what I have to offer.  I can forgive, turn the other cheek, and be the one to sacrifice.  In the meantime, I expect some sort of salvation to await my deed, but so far I've come up empty handed, and the realist inside me tends to doubt the legitimacy of such a feat.  I feel as if I'm falling, but I'm not sure how far the rabbit hole goes, and I don't know how long I'll be down there.  I don't know what's there to know, and most of all, I don't know what to expect when I come out of this.  Is this person going to be there to help me out of this?  Will I be down there to help him?  Or is what I fear most the most certain:</p>
<p>I am alone.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="kagomebucketicon.jpg" align="left" hspace="5">For this week's journal (which has been sadly absent) I have decided to talk about random things.  I did not neglect you, please realize, it's just what I wrote was probably not appropriate for right now.  I will be explaining everything soon, I'm still in a strange place though.  I like to call that place my own personal mental delusion.  I digress...</p>
<p>A little iPod update:  still waiting.  It will be coming on some day soon.  Next week will be the 3rd week, and if I don't get a "Shipping" update by Thursday, I'm going to customer service.  Those guys on Tech TV's the Screen Savers tried the offer and they got their iPods and gift certificates weeks ago.  Of course, they probably finished their offers faster than I did, so whatever.  It will be here, and I will have the pictures to prove it.  In the mean time, I will wait...</p>
<p>This week, I have been diving deeper and deeper into election depression.  I want this thing to be over.  I'm so sick of the fighting, the attack ads, everything!  It's disgusting, and I can't wait for there to be a president that everyone can agree actually is president.  They say even if that happens, there's still going to be debate over his legitimacy.  I guess Nader's right--the problem is the 2 party system.  Can anyone say revolution?  Maybe it's about time we had one.</p>
<p>Uh, I need to stop spending money.  I have spent too much, and I'm not working enough to replace it.  For tomorrow, I don't have to work until 3:30, which is pretty cool.  I don't have to show up at 11:30 a.m. and be miserable!  Thank God to the soul who swapped w/ me.  I'm looking forward to sleep, but not to dreams.  I don't have good dreams anymore.</p>
<p>Goodnight.</p>

<td colspan="99" align="left">Let me be patient, let me be kind<br>
Make me unselfish without being blind<br>
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not<br>
And endure what comes<br>
Cause he's all that I got<br>
and tell him...<br>
<br>
Tell him I need him<br>
Tell him I love him<br>
And it'll be alright<br>
<br>
Now I may have faith to make mountains fall<br>
But if I lack love, then I am nothing at all<br>
I can give away everything I possess<br>
But left without love, then I have no happiness<br>
<br>
I know I'm imperfect<br>
And not without sin<br>
But now that I'm older<br>
All childish things end<br>
and tell him...<br>
<br>
Tell him I need him<br>
Tell him I love him<br>
And it'll be alright<br>
<br>
I'll never be jealous<br>
And I won't be too kind<br>
Cause love is not boastful<br>
And love is not loud<br>
Tell him I need him<br>
Tell him I love him<br>
Everything's gonna be alright...<br>
<br>
Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth<br>
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?<br>
See what we now know is nothing compared<br>
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared<br>
and tell him...<br>
<br>
Tell him I need him<br>
Tell him I love him<br>
And it'll be alright...</td>
