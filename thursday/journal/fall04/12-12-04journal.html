<div class="post">
<p><img name="Icon" src="staykagomeicon.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="Stay Kagome" align="left" hspace="5">I haven't looked forward to this week. I don't really look forward to any week. There are a few things that make me happy, and here I think I'll try and figure all that out.</p>
<p>NOT working at Dial America makes me feel so much better than I ever thought possible. For one, I got to bum around my house all weekend, thus cleaning up a whole lotta mess and mending some of my roommate relations. I suppose David thinks I'm a slob, and I am a slob, but it's not because I am lazy. Because of other things. Well, Dial America is no longer one of them. So hooray for that!</p>
<p>Working on my cousin's website makes me happy. Sure, an academic-quality site is due Thursday at noon and I haven't exactly figured out how to present my cousin's photography in the gallery (let alone any content for the site), but that's ok! I'll figure all that out before then. This weekend, I used Fireworks to blur and slice up the picture of my cousin that I want to use as the dominant background throughout the site. I put in a transparent inline frame (something I've been dying to do since seeing an especially beautiful Inuyasha fan listing) and I also tooled for several hours unsuccessfully in Flash trying to construct a navigation bar. I scrapped that plan, and instead optimized the bar by hand with CSS. Oh, wonderful CSS! I can't wait to apply all my new tricks to my final website update.</p>
<p>Friends make me happy. No, not the dumbass TV show, but my good friends Missy and Genevieve, who aren't quite as removed as I once thought. On Saturday night, I went over to Gen's to watch <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>. It was an excellent movie, though Gen was distracted and didn't get much of it. Missy showed up after a night of studying with much gossip to chew on, and all-of-a-sudden I started this whole tirade on our collective bad moments throughout the years. Oh, I hit some highlights like that time I puked all over myself freshman year (not to be confused with the time I puked all over myself sophomore year OR junior year). I also hit the crown jewel that was setting my face on fire. I also dwelled on some oldies like that time in my Spanish IV class at McEachern I fell flat on my face in front of everyone (it was ok though, I was the first to laugh). In the end, we all agreed: I am crazy, Gen is a workaholic, and Missy has a history (a long a sorted history, which we all think we know about, but we really have <em>no</em>idea).</p>
<p>As twisted as it might sound, finals make me happy. Since silencing crusty ol' Griswold on Wednesday morning, I feel as if a great pressure has been lifted off of me. I only have one final, and I have two separate study dates to help me cope with that madness. Shakespeare is a pussy anyways.</p>
<p>Attention makes me happy too, so if you have some, send some of it my way. I'll try and make it worth your while.</p>
