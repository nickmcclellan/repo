<p>I am about to walk down to the library and work on my bibliography for Trivedi's paper...I just wanted to write something. I'm trying to write less this week since my Spring Break journal is ENOUGH for anyone to munch on. Plus, why the hell do I need to write everyday? I just wanted to say that despite things being rather shitty (term paper stress, no longer getting the house with Ben) I remain very optimistic. Plus, I'm getting over alot. I feel like I'm becoming very independent. No more of that co-dependent shit. I feel like I can see so much, like I've been given second eyes. Maybe not that much, but I just feel like after April 16th, I'll be able to do anything. I have the potential to do anything, and I think I'm realizing that. It's just sorta about taking the world by the balls and running with it. You know, it comes around for us all, the time when we're tested. Thing happen that we don't understand, and we can just roll over and take it or we can get up and fight. We can strike it out on our own, or we can run home and hide. I don't have this semester beat just yet, but I figure when I'm done, that's going to be that good thing. I'm going to be so much better off at the end of this...and the end is nigh.</p>
<p>Oh, yah, and Buffy ROCKED! One of the best theme developing episodes I've seen. I'm unspoiled here on out, baby...here we go!

<p>Two things. One, when I walked into my room tonight I sorta pondered the whole meaning of having a roommate. It is so weird coming back to my room having this complete stranger laying in my room sleeping. I just find the whole thing really odd, you know? It's not something that bothers me though, I think it's really drunken/fatigue nonsense.</p>
<p>Number two...I don't remember. Maybe it involved something of importance, but I guess I'll leave that up to you to decide. What the hell, consider it some deep dark secret I would never share and suddenly, in my drunken state, I forgot to reveal it. Damnit, huh? Well, I'm sure you stalkers will think of SOME words to put in my mouth. Just make sure you know where those words have been. You know, I don't want to pull any "Missy Valentines", if you know what I mean ;-) Well, to bed I go, paper writing tomorrow at the place where the sky is blue and the serve hot chocolate, and then...well, more sleep! Yey! Goodnight.</p>
<p>...I'm taking a break now. It's Thursday night now as opposed to early Thursday morning. I've been working here at Blue Sky for a bit over an hour, it seems. I mean, certainly. It took forever to find a spot. Yuck. Anyways, I've decided to title this week "Deadwood" for a couple of reasons. For one, I've been listening to that song alot. It's a garbage b-side, in fact, it's the first garbage b-side I really ever heard. Aside from #1 Crush or any of garbage's other soundtrack singles that never appeared on albums, "Deadwood" was the first song I heard off of an imported garbage single. It was the single for "I Think I'm Paranoid." I got it at Media Play near my Target, and it was just about the time that I really got into garbage and was so amazed at the concept of b-sides, or, as I understood at the time, "unreleased tracks." "Deadwood" was interesting, it was new. I was bound to appreciate it, being garbage. I don't think I understood it for a while though, it really never meant anything of significance to me until I got over the whole Greg thing. That's nothing now, it was nothing then, it was that I just listened to "Deadwood", it made me feel sad that I couldn't have been a more positive influence on him. Plus, I really didn't give a shit about him anymore.</p>
<p>Well, this week is "Deadwood." It's just dark and simple like that I guess. I don't want to go into it too much, I just wanted to explain briefly the significance of "Deadwood." Excellent song (though I hear garbage dislikes playing it live), download it!</p>
<p>I had fun last night. I get all obnoxious when I'm drunk. The Everclear made me oh so wasted, and I remember being in Jeff's friend Matt's room noticing my perception become all "wavy." I imagine I wasn't a joy riding over to Boneshakers, I tend to get loud. Dancing was fun. I dance fucked Marilia and Stefanie mostly. I picked up Kristin and Ray (I pick up too many people...). It was all in all an average night, but fun. Matt needed to leave early because he had an 8 o'clock class. I was alittle upset at that, why do you go out to Boneshakers if you have an 8 a.m. class? I stayed with Charlie and Thomas a little longer and we ended up at The Grill. I ran into Bryant and Whit who were very social. Whit kept insisting I let him buy me grilled cheese but all I could think about was all the Peeps I had consumed when I was drunk in New Orleans...No! No more of that! I wasn't that hungry anyways. Before we left, I saw Mary Kate and got her phone number. Jeff introduced me to her, and she's very cool. I may call her some Wednesday and invite her out with us. She was very sweet to me.</p>
<p>I got back to my room and wrote the two paragraph blurp you see above. I honestly don't know what the second thing was. I was just tired. My computer crashed while I was sleeping so I guess I'll never know if anyone IMed me in the few minutes my laptop can stand to stay powered up without being hooked to the wall. Oh well, probably nothing. I was asleep anyways.</p>
<p>I was awoken by the fire alarm. Some idiot girl burned some toast. It was a good opportunity to talk to Missy who also had to evacuate Mary Lyndon. We saw Dille! It was an awesome fire drill, a very social one. Thursday continues to be grunge day, I'm wearing the same thing I wore last night, but I swear, I don't smell. I would not leave my room if I smelled. Details, details...no more, I think.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I'll be doing tomorrow night, but I will be attending Krush Girls on Saturday night at the 40 Watt. Maybe Missy and I can try the whole fake ID thing again at the Package Werehouse, that would be fun. I want to get all wasted and dance like I did a month ago. Rachel will be coming, and maybe Gen, I have to ask her if she'd like to come. Tomorrow afternoon after the Lambda office and a poetry reading I must attend, I will be running with Genevieve and we will be dining at Earthfare. Maybe our night will depart from there to other fun things. Maybe I'll end up sleeping in to prepare for Saturday, my DAY of intense paper writing and studying and my NIGHT of drunken fun. Blah blah, I am done here, I write too much. At least this week won't be as bad as last week, that was WAY too much. Anyways, later all...hope to see you shaking your ass along side my girating backside :-)
