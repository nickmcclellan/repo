<div class="post">
<p>Sorry I've been neglecting the blog. Not much going on, really. I did the sorority social last night...that rocked! I am not very talkative now, so I will discuss such things later, I think.</p>
<p>Titled my journal last week "Afterglow" after the song...why don't you listen to it? Maybe you'll get the message.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Monday, April 28th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I have decided on a sorta major style change. After minimal scouring of the internet, I've noticed that no one indents their paragraphs...EVER! It would seem, at least. I've decided to adopt this approach as well. What's it going to hurt, right? Because the day titles sorta blend in now with the paragraphs, the titles will be bold. Neato, right? I think it looks sharp.</p>
<p>I'm not going into major details from the weekend--I will say it was a welcomed departure from the usual crap I'm involved with. I hear that the normal crowd went to Boneshakers. I thought Bones last Wednesday was rather ICK. I realize it's a scene that has been very unappealing, especially last week. I'm really glad I've decided not to drink on Wednesdays anymore (sometimes I lie). It's what's best.</p>
<p>Didn't get much done schoolwise this weekend. I really only tricked a bunch of Laura's friends into thinking I was straight and I was her boyfriend. As some of you may have read on my new away message, her friend Clayton was especially convinced. Mission: Accomplished.</p>
<p>I am really psyched about some pictures of Shirley Manson and garbage I've downloaded recently. This one I have is very sharp--she's against a blue wall dressed in a nice jacket and a scarf and she's looking up. It's so beautiful, I absolutley love it. It's my desktop picture, so if you happen to see me at Blue Sky this week, come admire the masterpiece. It was taken by Roxy Erickson, who I'm assuming is the sister or relative of Duke Erickson (I am not sure if he's married). She's a very good photographer :-)</p>
<p>This week I will be very busy, 3 papers to do. Luckily, the paper I haven't even started on isn't due until the 7th. I'll probably go all psycho on that one on the 6th. Until then, I'm contending with Spanish and my English Honors Option paper. What a rush...</p>
<p>This semester has just raced by, and it hasn't been one bit what I expected. I had alot of fun and wasted alot of time. I'm looking forward to a restful summer. I need to work alot, but I'm thinking of getting a second job as a change of pace--maybe at Bahama Breeze. I'll apply when I get back, I guess. I hate applying for jobs, what's the use? I already have a job that I get paid fairly well for. Barry was talking about the bus drivers getting paid $7.40 an hour today, and I think that's nice and all, but I get paid $8.57 ($10.57 when I'm doing overnights) AND I should have a raise since I'm well past my 3 year review. Whatever, we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>As for now, I'm off to Spanish and then some library time before Lambda. Let's see if we can't get this shit over with...

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, April 29th...1:52 a.m., HAPPY BIRTHDAY J. MATT STEPHENS!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Just got in from Blue Sky. My friends in Lambda, namely the amazing John Lynch, got me the most wonderful recognition present for my work in Lambda this year: a cane. Yes, I have a cane. It's sorta a "passing of the torch" from John to myself. I was so impressed with the present, it really floored me.</p>
<p>I tried to write an editorial for the Red and Black to hopefully appear before the end of the semester. Say a prayer for me! I would love to have a clip like that...I think I even get to have my picture in the paper. Wouldn't THAT be nice :-)</p>
<p align="center">"Now all I wanna do is sleep..."

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, April 30th...12:30 a.m.</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Here I am, sitting in my chair. If you notice one thing about me this evening--this week for that matter--you'll see that I've elevated my hands above my laptop. After finally realizing the dangers I subject myself to typing on this carpel tunnel syndrome death trap, I've realized that aches in my shoulders are worth it. Maybe I'll become more muscular...couldn't hurt.</p>
<p>WARNING: Expect soul searching and moodiness.</p>
<p>After my second to last night EVER with Thom on our much loved Buffy nights, I am feeling very much shattered. The "glue" that I must have been holding myself together with this whole semester--this whole year--has finally cracked and fallen apart. Maybe that's too harsh...let's just say Thom tore me up, or maybe I let him. He's a very good friend, perceptive. It's astonishing that someone I haven't spent more then two hours with EVER can make me feel this way. What's even more astonishing is the fact that he can see things in me that even my closest friends are just OBLIVIOUS to.</p>
<p>That's not the problem here, I'm not mad at my friends, they've done nothing wrong. Can I say something that you won't look at and laugh for hours about? Do I trust you, cold and unfeeling Blog? Can I sum up in one phrase what I desperatly don't want to acknowledge? Can I shatter my illusions of resilience and strength and you not look at me forever different? Can I trust you with this? Being completely off the subject: No, I can't. Last semester proved that I can't trust this fucking Internet Journal to be anything I want it to be. Anyways, I'll try, and I'll ignore your reaction like I always do. You all are just going to have to accept that.</p>
<p>The one thing I've told myself recently, constantly, is that of all the things I am feeling, of all the things I'm experience, the one thing I don't need is anyone else to help with anything. I just WANT you to know that. I feel like the expectation that someone is going to save me from myself, to save me from my challenges, that expectation has been eliminated. I would have you believe that all of my expectations have evaporated and I'm planted firmly on the ground and that I'm FINE. I would mislead you, and you're just dumb enough to believe me. You're just careless enough to let it slide.</p>
<p>The reality of the situation is that I am desperatly searching for something to save me from this. I'm pursuing this affirmation like the wild animal that it is, but I creep about it unbeknownst to any of you, and you can't SEE that, and that urks me! God, I don't know what I'm saying. I don't understand how I recognize that these are the things I don't want to do but I continue to incessantly DO them. I'm not a monster, if I could communicate one thing, it would be that I am not a monster. I am just very much lost right now...</p>
<p>Thom basically picked up on the fact that I've seemed very pessimistic lately. He's pointed this out before, but unlike alot of people that effortlessly seem to buy into my bullshit, he continued to ask me why, not backing down from his observation that something's soured me and he was curious what. Maybe he's right, maybe it has more to do with my family than I'd like to believe, but I just don't know...I'll be alright, honestly, I just want to go to bed and forget about it. All this just seems so pointless now, I just want to shut it all off and exit.</p>
<p>I've grown weary of this entry...I've decided to cease being moody and get some work done for a change. Yey.</p>

<p>Don't ask. It's best you don't get into whatever I was writing about early this morning. Just as I normally do whenever I get all revealy, I began to regret what I said. I'm not going to touch it though, I think it came out really well and it wasn't too personal; I phrased everything just right. And, can you believe it? Not one iota of drama to be seen. I really have learned from my mistakes.</p>
<p>In lighter news, I don't have to go to Parkes's class tomorrow morning. This opens me up to sleeping in, which I normally do on Thursdays, but since we have a Monday schedule on Thursday, I would be unable to do. I won't be able to see Carrie though...I lurve Carrie :-) Opps, I guess I can't come to Parkes's class drunk either...God, I was looking forward to THAT!</p>
<p>Also, I've been very proud of myself, runningwise. For some reason, the past two afternoons, while walking about campus in the hot Spring sun, I have gotten incredible urges to run my usual 4 mile laps around Milledge and Prince. I've done very well, though I regret not being able to go today because of a paper. If I ever inflate to the size of a giant grape (much like in Willy Wonka), we'll just have to blame the incessant amount of papers I am constantly having to write.</p>
<p>I've temporarily titled my journal "I Just Don't Care Anymore," mostly because I was listening to "Can't Cry These Tears" and just felt like I wanted to scream out the song every time Shirley went over the refain. What actually drove me into writing this journal now was listening to "Medication," so I'm not sure what's going to be the title this week...we'll have to see! Like anyone really cares (but have YOU noticed the consistant pessimistic tone of ALL of my journal titles this semester? Maybe you don't know me...)</p>
<p align="center">"Somebody get me out of here / I'm tearing out myself / Nobody gives a damn about me / Or anybody else..."</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, May 2nd...1:37 a.m.</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Hey all! I'm feeling so good right now. I just got back a bit ago from Molly O'Shea's with the PRETTIEST lesbian EVER, Kristin Googe. She accompanied me to Molly's, and with the ID I swindled from Sonya, I ACTUALLY got in! Can you believe that? Nick used a fake ID!! What an awesome night!</p>
<p>I'm actually having to go to bed early since I'm going to a schollarship reception tomorrow (I just realized I didn't RSVP :-[ ). Oh well. I'll blame it on Arches.</p>
<p>The real fun this week was at Matt and Kristin's surprise birthday party. They were so surprised. That's what I did Wednesday, and when I said "sometimes I lie" when I mentioned I would never drink again on Wednesday, that was in reference to the fact that I knew I would drink since I was to provide the Everclear for the evening. A WHOLE HANDLE! That sucker was GONE! Everyone went to the pool at the Reserve and started to swim, but I wasn't nearly drunk enough. I went back with Kristin and we made our hunch punch just ALITTLE bit stronger. The pool dwellers returned and Daniel Tindol suggested that I make out with him, Ray, and Kristin to see if his tongue ring made any real difference. After some convincing, I did, and that's when the "making out" of the evening commenced...</p>
<p>I think I may have been to one to originally suggest that we play spin the bottle. I ended up making out with just about everyone in the circle, but my most proud make-outs would have to be Jeremy, Marilia, Kristin, Daniel Tindol, Ray, these girls Ed and Tiffany, and the adorable Matt Stephens (wait...that was everyone I made out with). It was great! After this, we all darted off to Boneshakers which must have lasted about 20 minutes because we left just as quickly to go to the Grill. The Grill was fun, afterward we went to Daniel's so I could pick up my watch that I left behind. We then went home.</p>
<p>I had so much fun, and I was so happy to give Matt and Kristin any concievable amount of joy on their birthdays. Surprise parties are fun...maybe my friends will have one for me when I turn 21 ;-)</p>
<p>Now it's bedtime. Possibly my last Thursday in Athens this semester, and that's come and gone. Hopefully I will be around next Thursday...doubtful, though. Thursday is like the end of the week, it's like the beginning...I must admit that I have defined myself through Thursdays this semester. Maybe my summer Thursdays won't be nearly as boring as I imagine they most likely will be...</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, May 3rd</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Hello all, I am now entralled in the fits of extreme boredom that certainly envelop everyone that now sit in the UGA main library. It's too bad I didn't pick a major I'd be more excited about doing work for, but what the hell. It's becoming a beautiful Saturday afternoon, what else better could I hope to be doing besides working on a miserable research paper? Answer me that.</p>
<p>This entry is an apology for this week's entry as a whole. To those of you who know me, you must think I'm insane. Honestly, talking to Thom really did rip me apart, but not in the way I must have made it sound. Thom basically asked me what it was that was making me so pessimistic this semester and I answered him this: shit. I feel like no matter where I go I'm handed more and more shit. Honestly, I don't know where to put it anymore. I go home, you remember, Easter Sunday, I went home for an afternoon. I sit down for dinner--a dinner I have been looking forward to since I missed it last year. I really value having times like this with my family; just me, my dad, and my sister. So what happens? My dad decides that this would be the perfect time to mention that he expects my sister and I to pay rent during the summer.</p>
<p>SHIT! What am I supposed to do with this? Am I supposed to swallow the pork roast I'm chewing in my mouth and SMILE? I don't understand why everything lately has to be such a fucking hassle. I just want something to come to me EASY, for once, nice and EASY. I remember feeling slightly like I do now in the past, and it always seemed like something would come along that would perk me right up. Things have come along: a party here, a scholarship there. All in all, though, I have been lacking the affirmation that I have been dying to get. I hope that I can find it at home, but how am I supposed to react when everytime I even VISIT I'm handed shit. I don't know what to do, and my moodiness on Tuesday was a reaction to that.</p>
<p>I got over it. Matt and Kristin's surprise party was nice. Being able to skip Parkes on Thursday was nice. The Lambda potluck I had yesterday was nice (Marilia is SO sexy in that black ensemble she was wearing), and Little Mermaid last night was cool too. I find the only way I can avoid this rain of shit is if I just ignore it--go about my business as if it isn't even there. Who cares if I have a paper, chapbook, and final to be done on Monday? I've done this all before, I'll do it again, so I am just letting it go. I'm trying not to take the situation all at once, and moments like Tuesday, it's like I can't help but feel the weight I'm under. I'm sorry, but putting how I feel in a place like this makes me feel better. Venting feels GOOD.</p>
<p>So, yah, last night we had a movie night at Reed w/ John, Gareth, Stefanie (that sexy girl I made cinnimon bread with Friday), Jeremy, and some guy. Barry and Matthew showed up at last after they got back from some WHIM trip to New York City. They got as far as D.C. when Matt's "Check Engine" light came on and they decided to turn around. Barry ROCKS like whatever number to states there are between New York and Georgia, and Matt, well, he's just very COOL...</p>
<p>Tonight there is SOMETHING at Chrissy's...I'm not sure if it's a secret, but I suppose if I publish this after SAID SURPRISE has happened, it won't matter. Good people should be in attendence for said event. Not sure if I'll drink, or if I do if I'll drink alot. Sunday I've got to focus on my Spanish final and my Creative Writing Chapbook while also editing the work I will have done today on my Parkes Honors Option Paper. After Monday, all my efforts will go toward my, as of yet, NON-EXISTANT Honors Option paper for Journalism. Want to see how fast I can do a research paper on ethics in print journalism? I'm hoping I can finish before 5 p.m. Wednesday. As for my departure, that will be scheduled for Thursday evening--maybe Friday morning (depending on when I'm able to check out). Less than one week...this all will be over.</p>
<p>In post-depressing "end of the semester" developments, Missy and I are having a Toga Luau at her place on May 15th. Sure, you may decide to go Matrix Reloading, but let me advise against such a thought as partying with Missy and I will involve mucho alcohol, an evening in a swank Alpharetta abode (1990 Home and Garden's House of the Year), and also this will be an activity that will certainly get you LAID. If you haven't got an invite, let me know...I may extend one to you--you know, unless there's something wrong with you. I'm certain there will be certain EXCLUSIONS.</p>
<p>Ok, back to work! Goodbye my friends!
