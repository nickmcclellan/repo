<p>I guess it all starts tomorrow, huh? I am hopefully going to resolve this scheduling problem by 8am tomorrow. After that I guess I have to join the rest of the world and start purchasing books and studying. I guess we all can't live in these dream worlds where there is no work to be done, all play. Nope, responcibility here I come!</p>
<p>Today was a very cool day, quite productive social wise. I had a lunch/movie date with Bryant and that was really awesome. We saw <I>Igby Goes Down</i>, and I thought it was pretty good. Entertaining, and kinda funny, in a morbidly depressing way. You know what's morbidly depressing, this book I'm reading. I finally picked up <I>The Heart is Deceitful Above All Things</i> by J. T. Leroy, and let me tell you, it's a downer! I was reading it last night when I was kinda bummed about my whole situation and it really effected me. Made me really depressed there for a second. Good thing John pulled me out of that. Despite this, I still intend on finishing the book.</p>
<p>What will this week hold for me? I sure hope it has some answers. My whole "funk" is up, I think. I am feeling better, and I really do think this thing has been paranoia. John helped me to realize that. He's an awesome friend, and it's nice to know he's there to console me when I need it most.</p>
<p>I'm having a thing with Missy right now...I hope it doesn't last. I know it's really shitty writing about it here, but I can't help it, I just want to say that it's really nothing and all I'm looking for from her is to get over it, I'm not holding any grudges. Let's deal with it and move on. When that's resolved, I'll feel a bit better, but whatever til then.</p>
<p>I had a potluck with the Pad tonight...our mutual friend Charlie wasn't there. I sensed in the room an air of disappointment throughout the evening. I mentioned his name once and everyone looked up, a glimmer in their eyes. Turned out everyone missed Charlie, that's for sure. We all watched the Pad with suspicious eyes...everyone knows she's jealous of Charlie. Who wouldn't be jealous of a successful, sophisticated, sexy individual like that.  Sigh...the Pad only wishes she was that cool (but you KNOW you are Pad!)</p>
<p>Enough banter for now...I will be sleeping now...goodnight!

<p>I had a very busy day today. I finally got my schedule worked out. Now I have the framework with which to mold my existence...so extisential. I plan on running on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I plan on reading alot on Tuesdays and Thursdays...this semester seems like it will be very reading intensive, which really blows because I know I won't keep up with it. Sigh...I guess it's all about what I was talking to Vicki about today. For the longest time, I've been reaping the investments I sowed when I was in high school. It's been great, I've gotten to address certain aspects of myself that I never got to develop in high school. I never got to do "gay" things in high school, it's been really great doing all that. Now I have to make more investments. It's time to start thinking of the future, what am I going to do after UGA. What can I do now to make the rest of my life as good as life is now. I have several ideas.</p>
<p>My journalism class this semester seems to be offering me an opportunity to write for the Red and Black. I would like to really capitalize on that and develop my writing talent toward journalism. I can start to make a name for myself and maybe even *GASP* get a job! So ambitious am I.</p>
<p>I've reconciled with Sonya...she took the first step and I really appreciate that. She's a good girl...I won't forget that. Well, I am off to other things...bed hopefully. Have to finish the laundry though. Until next time.</p>

<p>I guess this is inevitable, so I'll make it brief...or I'll try. I'm titling my journal this week Separation for obvious reasons, and some that are good, you know...because I'm an up kind of person, so there has to be something optimistic, you know? Because I am NEVER Paranoid...never, and I think that is so cool. I know, I'm not an idiot, I'm very keen and I can read the writing that's on the wall.</p>
<p>Yes...you can understand me. If you try, certainly you know. Yes.</p>
<p>Separation because from this moment on it's me and me only. There's nobody standing behind me or next to me. My feelings are my own now, and that's good. That's all I can find that's good in this. I don't want to think about that though. I don't want to think about anything. I just want to do something that's going to make this any bit like how I thought it would be. I was so naive and insepid. I'm such a fucking fool. It happened last year, you just let yourself go, thinking that maybe it's that time, because that time of year is so fucked up anyways. And it was, and I believed it, I always believe it. So trusting, so very innocent. No intention, no intervention, nothing. Just that chord repeated over and over again, thinking that maybe it's what I need this time, maybe it's something more, maybe something, but that involves thinking, and that's not the thing I need now. I couldn't find Missy, but I think she's coming now, maybe, hopefully, I mean, wouldn't she be here for something like this?</p>
<p>She was here...she's cool, yah, I'm going to watch "Becoming" with her. What am I supposed to do now? I don't want to sleep in the dark place, but I suppose I have to, I have to. I don't have to eat for days. But I have to sleep, and all. I'm strong, and I will be alright. I climb mountains.

<div class="post">
<p>Sorry I made such a vauge and completely mindless entry, but I was in a bad spot, and I kinda still am. I had very strange dreams last night (Note that I had dreams...I know I have them all the time, but I rarely remember them). In one, I kept dying over and over and was being chased by a government agency who kept bringing me back in a new body because they had to preserve some sort of secret. The other dream...I don't remember.</p>
<p>Well, the point of this all is Bryant told me that he didn't feel the same way about me that I felt about him...anymore. I had sensed this...every since last Wednesday, I knew. It was a scary thought because I really liked him and I didn't want to continue feeling that way if he didn't feel the same way. It just sucked...it was like the good thing about all of this mess was instantly gone and it was overwhelming. It also meant that my perceptions about the whole situation were correct. This is a good indication that any further perceptions of mine are probably true, so thus I had to end whatever I had felt for him...and that was hard. I realized that it wasn't anything that I had for him, it was all raw potential. I had capped it last Wednesday, realizing that I shouldn't go too far. He kept it vaguely clear that he had plateued. Anyways, the sudden loss of all that possibility was just really a fucking let-down. I wanted to get drunk tonight with Missy (One of many things I wanted to do) but I'm not going to get drunk feeling all down like this! I can't imagine what I would act like. My friends are all being so very cool to me, Vicki, Missy, John, Sonya, Gen, and Allyson...they all try their best, and ultimatly, my way to feeling better is through my friends. It just sucks now, but separation is good.</p>
<p>Something I mentioned before to people is I hate being subjugated, and that's how I felt alot of the time.  Separation gets me away from this...I stay away and start to remember just how I was before. I think I was in that whole, "I don't want to date for a while" mode...and after dumping that and finding someone I could really get into, it's kinda hard to get back into that. I feel like I want a rebound, but that's NOT what I'm going to do. I think I'm just going to have to live. "The hardest thing to do in this world is to live in it. Live." I'm going to have to struggle through my crap semester, read all these things, write all these papers, make my grades, all by myself. That sucks, but I'm going to do it. I have to. And when things get hard, my friends are there for me. Why does Spring semester always have to suck?
