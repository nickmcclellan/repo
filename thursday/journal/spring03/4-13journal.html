<div class="post">
<p>Yoshimi! Oh, Yoshimi, they don't believe me! I know you won't let those robots eat me! Oh, yes, Yoshimi!</p>
<p>Certainly you know what this means. Come Tuesday, I will be getting all krunk with my new most favorite band! YEA RIGHT! I would be so much more psyched for a garbage Athens show, but anyways, I'm really into the Flaming Lips. I know I've mentioned it several times since Christmas, but <I>Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots</I> is so amazing. I haven't gotten much into former Lips stuff, but I suspect I might. This summer (when I have money) I will certainly pick up an album. If you haven't heard <I>Yoshimi</i>, go smack your ass with a cattle prod and cry about it.</p>
<p>I threw around the excuse this weekend that the reason I didn't BoyBall with just about every other gay person in Athens was because I was saving my energies for the Lips. That's partly true, I really wasn't into spending $20 on the show. I'm sure it was fantastic, but my financial woes are waxing once more, and I really need to conserve. I bought the Lips tickets weeks ago and they were about $20, so I guess the events cancel eachother out.</p>
<p>My evening wasn't all tears and sorrows, oh no, but for a while it seemed it might be. This weekend seemed like it was going to be lame because both Gen and Missy left for home. I feel at least with them around I can soldier on despite lack of parties and money. I was invited to a party at Dessa's (remember last semester!) and was really excited about bringing some people to it. I wanted to see if Barry would come, but I got to Blue Sky much too late yesterday afternoon to ask. Vicki was a no-show as well--she had to do taxes :-X She would have enjoyed herself.</p>
<p>Since no one would go with me, I told the Pad that I wouldn't go either. I then proceeded to order a pizza and watch Buffy. This was pleasant. My pleasantries were spoiled by another phone call from the Pad enquiring if I'd like to tool around with her doing non-party things. This sounded more appealing to my mood, so I went to the Pads. We ended up visiting our sexy friend Charlie and we talked about a bunch of stuff. "The World's Worst Drivers 2" was on FX, that was fun to watch, if just for a few minutes. Charlie had to have us go (being all annoyingly coupled, as I pointed out, he had to have some late night phone interfacing with his man). The Pad and I decided, wtf, why not make a cameo at Dessa's.</p>
<p>WHY was I so frickin' down earlier that day?? Barry and Alex showed up and they had GOLDEN GRAIN!!! Do you know what Golden Grain is??? I had heard of such a beast, but I had never seen it. Apparently, it's a different brand of Everclear. They had fucking GOLDEN GRAIN and I couldn't have any because I had in tow my precious shit-mobile. Fuck, just FUCK!</p>
<p>We partied briefly. Everyone was drunk and I wasn't, so I was all inhibited. I get so bogged down with shit sometimes, I wish I didn't have to have a placebo like alcohol to make me feel like I can do things. I realize it's not worth the trouble, but I do it anyways. Trevor, a friend of the Pad's, was pretty gone, I hope he's alright. I saw lots of people I knew, it was nice. I'm glad I ended up doing something last night. I was tired, so the Pad and I left around 2ish, I think. I got to bed. Very cozy evening.</p>
<p>It really goes to show me that I really shouldn't get bogged down. I feel like the upcoming summer I want to spend some time alone, by myself. I was feeling this morning like all I wanted to do was hike up to the very top of Kennesaw and just reinvest. I need to figure out where that expected perception of myself and the actual representation begin and end, because I'm not a bad guy, I'm not. I just need to work some things out and push some people away. Some people just make me feel like shit...</p>
<p>Damn, that was a long entry. You can tell I'm not so enamored with the notion of writing a 5 page paper in Spanish by Wednesday. I'll do it though! You'll see. You'll all see...

<p>It's early, and I have eight minutes before I need to go to class. I am listening to "Fake Plastic Trees", something I apparently downloaded months ago onto my computer for some reason, I can't remember. I didn't listen to it much then, apparently, but now I think it's pretty cool. It reminds me of "So Like a Rose." It's very cool...</p>

<p>I must make this brief...Flaming Lips ROCKED! Best SHOW I've been to BY FAR...Michiru, whom I respect very much, said something to me that made alot of sense. She said, "If you can't be alone, you shouldn't be with somebody else." Also, today is the end of the world--notice I don't care. Blah blah...tons of other things...I revised some poems, that's been fun...I worked on my Spanish paper today non-stop and actually finished it. Wow.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to bed...I have "Are You a Hypnotist" in my head, even though the Lips didn't play it. They fucking rocked, ya'll...they fucking rocked!</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Last night was fun, but it's sorta convinced me that drinking on Wednesday, at least until the conclusion of this semester, is really pointless. Honestly, I was just tipsy and most of my obnoxious tendencies were coming from my own obnoxious nature. It has really just served the purpose I had intended it to do earlier this semester but now no longer wish for it to do: I feel so numb, or encouraged by this "placebo" to act as if I were numb. I don't need to act this way, I can dance and socialize without having this substance floating around inside of me relieving me of my inhibitions. With the exception of this weekend (fun PARTY weekend), I will start going easy on the alcohol consumption. One thing though--Parrot Bay and Gatorade are a delicious combination :-)</p>
<p>I want to say something more about what Michiru shared with me. I feel like pre-(If you don't know what this is, you don't know me) I was dealing with this question, "Who am I?" This was sort of put on hold though as suddenly, I began to see myself with someone that I really had a longing for. This happened so quickly and was just as quickly snatched away from me, and these last few months I've been spinning around, confused, wondering exactly what was the point of the whole ordeal. Suddenly, this question I had sought to answer, "Who am I," had been complicated with more questions: what do I want; why does it matter? I've been told that everyone experiences this. It is this feeling when you have no idea what anything means anymore. I've felt this way. I haven't understood the point of anything these last few months. I've constantly second-guessed myself and my intentions as well as the intentions of others.</p>
<p>Basically, what I've realized in this blind panic I've been in is that it's not up to someone else to "save me"; No one's going to sweep me off my feet and solve all my problems for me. No one's going to suddenly appear and be for me everything I desire. I've learned that things aren't easy like that, and if they appear to be, you're being decieved. You're getting off cheap and you're ultimately a lesser person for having something seemingly so wonderful handed to you, things don't work like that. We aren't born into positions of power, we don't recieve the answers in preparation for the hard questions. I'm thankful for this because I believe I'm a better person for having to endure failure and lonliness. I am stronger because of it. I felt that Michiru understood that, and she wasn't upset. She's a very strong, creative, and genuine person, and I know that whomever she ends with, whatever she ends up doing, she's going to bring such passion to it that she's never going to have to worry about the petty things that tear us down. She's earned it, but moreso, she hasn't earned anything. She will be happy and fulfilled because SHE IS, or SHE WILL BE. The rest, who she ends up with, how that occurs, what it means to ANYONE, is just trivia.</p>
<p>In my case, I truly believe that if I'm patient and not needy, something's going to come along that I will truly enjoy--whether that be a person or some sort of opportunity. I have realized that it's not the outside that matters, it's what inside that needs the most attention. I don't need to be defined by who I date because that's only the crust of me. There's so much more.</p>
<p>I intend not to rush into anything like I did the last time. I'm sure we'll see. As far as that "good thing" that's coming, I'm not waiting anymore. I think I'll go party for a while, and if it decides to show up, I'll be with my friends.</p>
<p>In other "cute boy" news, I happen to be at Blue Sky at this very moment and am eyeing this very cute guy. He lives in my dorm--very cute, very mysterious. Seems interesting.</p>
<p>Ok, in closing, my most treasured wish at the moment is for Missy Valentine to feel better. It turns out our dear pigeon has Mono. I wish her luck dealing with her life in Mono. I haven't seen her since Sunday night/early Monday morning. I miss the hell out of her. In other best friend news, Genevieve ROCKS! She invited me to the Grit and I enjoyed a delicious veggie burger with her and Lindsey. Ok, I'm gone (throwing glances to cute Mary Lyndon boy in glasses with highlighted hair).

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, April 19th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Ok, memories that stand out from last night: Evan pouring hunch punch in my eye, me crashing Marilia and Kristin's "party", talking to Matt for a bit, (blacked out on the ride home), watching Buffy with Jeremy, and blah blah blah.</p>
<p>I titled the journal "Drunk on Bacardi" because, well, Wednesday I was drunk on Bacardi for stupid reasons, and from that Nada Surf song I downloaded called "Bacardi." You all definitely need to download it.</p>
<p>As for now, I'm going to shower and get the taste of alcohol and other icky things from my mouth...it wasn't a "good" night, this will forever be known as the drunk semester. Later all...
