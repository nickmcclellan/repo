<p>Picked up a shift tomorrow. Going to work for Nicole. We had a nice lunch together today. No, not Levesque, the sexy one, Nicole from T-Mac, the married, currently fucking her husband, one. She's nice.</p>
<p>Tonight seems like the first night in a while that I've been sitting at home with nothing to do. I've been so occupied this summer. New job. Boyfriend. Lambda. BILLS. Damned Cingular. That's about $200 I'll never see again. *grumble grumble*</p>
<p>I talked to T-Mac on Sunday. Mike said that he'd call me this Fall if he needed me some weekend and I could call him if I needed some quick cash. I've told alot of people I take alot of pride being a server. It's very special. You don't know unless you become one of us. It's very surreal. Suddenly, you are open up to a world you could never see before. You understand that tipping is NOT an option, but a duty. Trusting other people to pay your bills...that's insane.</p>
<p>Notice my random list of songs. Other favorites, maybe current flavors, include "The Caterpillar", The Cure...and well, that's all I can think of now. I downloaded Chevelle's "Send the Pain Below" just because they are hot in that video. I'm listening to a playlist now. I miss downloading songs. Need better connection. Dial up blows ass.</p>
<p>Am making mundo bucks from this weekend. Hope to hold onto said money. Moving day is coming soon. STILL don't have $900 plus for my bills, but I'm TRYING! I'm trying very hard.</p>
<p>This week will be over soon. I'm off Wednesday, maybe, unless I pick up a shift. I get to harass Amber tomorrow morning. I can't wait. She's my new favorite person at T-Mac. Oh, excitment! I need to make my sister dinner now, so off I go. Thanks for taking an interesting in my existance. Go to homestarrunner.com and buy me a t-shirt. Thank you.

<p>Yes! I finally did the ghosthunting I wanted to do since last year. Nicole and I went to an unknown soldier's grave in Cartersville and did everything we were supposed to. It didn't work. It didn't matter. We had a great time. Watched Buffy when we got back. I stayed up till...well, now, and I don't know why. I was chatting with Parker for a while and then other people, so I guess I just didn't want to sleep. I don't work tomorrow. I've been sick this week with a cold, so I figure that I need the rest in the morning anyways. I need a break, who cares! Maybe I should go back to Cartersville and see our friend again...I think NOT.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll hang out w/ Nicole tomorrow. That would be nice. She's leaving on Thursday. NOT FAIR! I'm going to Ohio Friday morning. Looking forward to that. It's my vacation, per se. Haven't seen my mom since "Unhappy Thanksgiving." We'll have a nice time in Ohio. Yah, Ohio.</p>
<p>Well, it's time for bed. I'm watching this strange video on MTV...it's all 80's animation. So technoish, I guess. Interesting. Some kind of "Junior/Senior" thing. Not sure what that means. Maybe Beck? I just don't know. Oh, good night...good night...good morning...good afternoon</p>

<p>Am in Ohio at the moment. In a hotel room with my mother and sister. It's been a nice visit. My mom is doing fine. We went to the lake today and went fishing. Stuffed myself at dinner, I don't know what my problem is. Joey is still a wimp, I kicked his ass!</p>
<p>Jeremy called today. I missed the call. It upset me. I would love to talk to him. It's too bad I missed him.</p>
<p>Matt dropped me and my sister off at the airport. We went ghosthunting, he and I on Thursday night. I got pulled over in Marietta Square! I had to make up this bull-shit story that I got lost and had to make a U-turn in the Confederate cemetary. WHATEVER, right? He believed me. Anyways, Matt didn't have to drop us off. He rocks. Marshmallow, can you hear me?</p>
<p>I guess I'll cave and go to bed. See me Georgia side on Monday night. Marietta-side--not for long! Need to make money...but have a feeling that money won't be that much of an issue...hopefully. Things are getting better. Adios baby!
