<p>Happy Easter to all! I hope people aren't smoking up on the day Jesus went on up to heaven. That would be WRONG!</p>
<p>Last night I went to John's birthday party. I was there for a long time, but I can assure everyone, I took things real easy. I was not nearly as drunk as I was on Friday. I spent most of the day Saturday sleeping, getting over Friday. I didn't get much sleep (after the hot night of sex I had with Jeremy =-O ). I woke up around 11ish to give some people a status check and then I returned to slumber land until around 3, when I woke up briefly to talk to other people. I then returned to bed again, just laying down--trying to get over the dizziness. I got up for good at 5, getting all snazed up for the night. I went to Rocky's with Jeremy for dinner. We had to debrief about the sex, you know...</p>
<p>I asked Jeremy if we had ever had a fight. He apparently remembers this "silent" fight we had fall semester of my freshman year. I have no memory of this! I think that maybe I didn't know who he was or I thought he was someone else. Very odd. We did get in this huge fight last night, though. That bastard had my hunch punch and he took half of it for himself because I had finished the punch bowl! That SOB! We were fighting for 10 minutes. We probably shouldn't have sex for a couple of days, I think it's going to take some time for me to get over him taking away my nasty tasting happiness. That little shit...</p>
<p>Highlighs of the night include: not throwing up, hanging out with my very good friend Marilia, dance fucking the iridescent Charlie Tucker, reminding Ali that my name was Nick (with the big dick!), seeing the GLORIOUS Barry Branford grace us with his presence, holding helplessly in my arms the very sexy birthday boy John Lynch, and most importantly, the orgy that ensued on the bed after most people left the party (I bet you're upset you missed that, huh JEREMY! That's what you get, bitch, that's what you get!).</p>
<p>I'll be on the Marietta side of things for today, probably driving back this evening and going to bed. Since Lent is finally over, I am able to have milk again! Oh, dining halls beware! Goodbye all!</p>
<p align="center">"I am milk / I am red-top kitchen / I am cool / Cool as the deep, blue ocean...I'm waiting! I'm waiting for you / I'm making, I'm breaking / for you..."

<p>It's official, I really want to go home. These past two semesters have been great, really, but my life would be so much better in other areas besides social-wise if I spent some serious time working and doing things on my own. This summer, I look forward to working with the Marietta Daily Journal, maybe getting some much needed clips. I know I have this innate talent at writing, I just need to address the more journalistic qualities of it--and that does NOT include my blog. I'll definitely blog over the summer, moreso probably then I did last summer, but it won't be as often as I do during the semester. I won't have anything interesting to report anyways...</p>
<p>Target will suck, but I think that if they are non-cooperative with hours this time around, I may try to get a second job. I need to make alot of money so I can handle the coming semesters, my Junior year. It's half-way over. Wow. Oh well, I'm off, I'm not one to write on Tuesdays often, but I felt an itch. Later all.</p>
<p>...HOLY SHIT! Blast from the past, I just thought I'd write something at the moment this has GRASPED me...but someone has just walked into Blue Sky whilst I was studying that, I must admit, had an interesting effect on me, especially when I was younger. I won't share his name--that wouldn't be cool. I just had a really cute crush on him when I worked at Kroger. GOD, I must have been 15 or 16 years old. I remember on day, I was working at Register 2 (the worst place, I HATED working there), and he was a bagger, per se, and he came in and I offered him a Mentos or something (This was a defining moment of my pitiful young existance). He said he was cool, but I pinned over this incident for, wow, probably at least a few days.</p>
<p>I love random adolescent memories...I was such an innocent guy.</p>
<p>He never did return to me my copy of "Graduation Day" Parts One and Two of <I>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, what an ass. What an adorable, absolutly oblivous-to-my-existance, fucking adorable guy. Ahhhh...</p>
<p>...and the worst part is I still remember his screen name! (yah right, like I'd but THAT here...)</p>
<p>What the hell, as a sort of Tuesday Blog BONUS, I'll include something I just wrote tonight--I think it came out well. Some things send me spiralling into prose. <a href="4-22untitled.html" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read what I will just refer to as a potential work-in-progress.
