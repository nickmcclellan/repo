<p>Rachel and I talked before...well, now, and I shared with her my idiotic way of "courting." I mean, it's obvious now, but I court people that I have crushes on by ignoring them, you know, fear of rejection crap. It makes things very difficult, mostly, you know, because how the hell do you know I like you if I'm all ignoring you? I wish I had more gall, you know, if I was more like John. John has no problem communicating how he feels about someone. John gets rejected, sure, but John also gets beyond my stupid ignoring stage. I lack confidence, obviously, but I'm constantly assured that I should feel otherwise. Anyways, this all stems from a greater issue I realize I have...I don't really want to get into that now. I might expound on this once I feel it's appropriate.</p>
<p>Well, that's all I really wanted to say...for no reason besides I think it's relevant to the whole purpose of the blog...communication. It's what I realize I need to change about myself. I think I will attempt to be more open about how I feel and make my intentions (or I should say desires) more obvious. I'm cute, right? Nobody understands me...</p>
<p>Shame on you for not understanding!</p>
<p>Anyways, now being Monday morning, I digress...aside from issues, I think I will get a bit of a respite before Spring Break. Doesn't seem like I've got too many pressing things before that...I have a Journalism Test, but that's gonna be a piece of cake, assuming it's like JOUR3310.</p>
<p>I am looking at a house on Prince St. today with John's friend Ben who I am considering living with next year. I hope I like it, it would be nice to put all this living situation drama to rest. I was going to live with Sonya and Ilya, but that seems very sketch, and alot of people have advised me against it. They also told me the other day that they were liking the two bedroom places they'd been looking at and they weren't sure they'd have enough room for me. That was a real let down, I really don't appreciate them not being 100% about me living with them. No matter, I have explored several other living opportunities and I think I'll be just fine. Marilia is also looking for a roommate so if this house thing doesn't work out, I will probably explore that opportunity next.</p>
<p>Scary stuff this morning. Having worked all weekend on the midterm and revision paper, I did not read the five chapters of <I>The Secret Agent</i> that Parkes assigned us. There is NOTHING scarier then getting called on to discuss a novel you have no idea about...I was really REACHING. I think I played confused well enough for him for him not to be phased...it certainly gave me an adrenaline boost, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Well, for now, I must finish my Trivedi midterm before 5 and have a quick lunch with Missy. Later all!

<p>I have been listening to "Fight Test" lately, it's too bad I got out of that CD around when I got here. "Fight Test" remains a very cool song. That whole album rocks...but I'll not get into that, I'm sure I already have...</p>
<p>I feel in love with the house Ben showed me yesterday! It seems like it will be so nice if I end up living there. The room I am looking at is very nice, it has two windows and a faux fireplace AND its own bathroom. I told Ben I didn't have to have the room, but I'd really like it. I think I might end up with it, I hope, if things work out. I am willing to get a job for this, I am really loving the idea of MOVING OUT of Marietta. God, to be able to be independent, that will occur one day...to be master of my own destiny, blah blah, that sounds annoying, huh? Well, I'd just like to be on my own in my own space, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>Anthony said my journal was witty...I found that interesting, I am not sure I understand really what he meant, but I will try to be "wittier" and see what happens. I don't have much to be witty about now. I'm feeling sheltered now. I have to see Trivedi tomorrow about my Honors Option paper that I have no idea what I'll be writing about. I'm going to skim through some of Shakespeare's Sonnets tonight and see if I can think of anything. Hopefully I'll be prepared to meet with him tomorrow.</p>
<p>Finally! I finished the Pad's webpage. I also had to work some on Charlie's page. They both came out very nice and the links and everything are working...I'm so tired, but I'm going to go running anyways. I figure after 4 miles I'll feel really good, I'll lay down for a while and do my laundry and maybe head to the library to get that Shakespeare book. After all that, I'm going to stay here and watch Buffy. If my ASSHOLE roommate has some sort of problem with that, he's just going to have to deal with it. After that, I'll go downtown to Blue Sky and read until I get tired or bored or both. I have to talk my dad at some point in that spance of time too...anyways, if you keep linking to my journal directly, you should go to the mainpage more often. I totally say things there too! You just can't read them cause your eyes are always here...shame on you! Ok, later all...

<div class="post">
<p>Plans for Friday night are materializing...turns out "Divas on Wheels: Hell on Heels" is Friday and there will be an extended drag show at Boneshakers at midnight. My sister also revealed interest in coming into town that night...fun would be had if she came with her usually supply of alcohol. I've never gotten drunk with her before, it would be a treat, for damn sure. Well, before all that, I should have fun at Bones tonight.</p>
<p>In other news, my computer is being freakishly wierd so I would anticipate a crash in the next few days...that sucks, what else can go wrong? I can't seem to care though..."We'll see it through, it's what we're always here to do / So we will walk through the fire! / Cause where else could we turn? / And we will walk through the fire! / And let it BURN!"</p>
<p>...I'd like to say I don't care anymore, you know? That's what I'd have you and everyone else believe, but I was walking out of the library this afternoon, down the ramp to the bus stop. I had something grip me, something that isn't close to dead yet. I do care. I care a great deal how shitty things are. I try to numb it all with time, empty meaningless time, but these problems still plague me. Nothing is going to chase them away, I am going to have to deal with them. I'm tired of dealing with failure...I haven't had nearly as much as I could have, but everytime it happens, it hurts less. Why does it hurt less?</p>
<p>Why is there this empty spot inside that absorbs all that flush and pain and leaves me with this pointless apathy? What's the point? The challenges just mount and mount until eventually you can't take it anymore. Is apathy the small token I get from failure? Is this absence of pain and worry a good thing? Or is it killing me? Am I bound to tumble down this molehill I've created that is my life? I just don't know...</p>
<p>But I know at least that I care. I care a great deal about what happens to me in the end. Maybe it's experience, not apathy. I don't care about these failures because I know I will overcome them eventually. "You may have won the battle, but you'll lose the war!" Is experience my consolation prize? Why can't apathy and experience be the same thing? Maybe in this marble cake of life, apathy and experience are these streaks of black. Dark chocolatey goodness. I could go for a slice of marble cake right now, that's for sure...</p>
<p>But I've tried so much so far. It's still not enough. Not enough. It's never enough. It will just keep waxing and waning, waxing and waning, my apathy against my desire to be. One day, it's just going to consume me and I will be nothing. I will become nothing but a shell...you know, like that movie <I>The Neverending Story</i>. My Fantasia is being eaten up by the Nothing. In my shell, I won't have a grain of hope to start over...I won't have any desire to start over. This may happen someday, but not today. Not tomorrow. Someday, maybe, but I've got things worth fighting for. There's got to be something here I can work with...</p>
<p>I guess that's why I'll title this week "The Nothing." If you haven't seen <I>The Neverending Story</i>, shame on you. Tonight, there is a new Angel! I guess The Nothing gets at least one hour of my time tonight...then Boneshakers...so I guess The Nothing gets the whole night. Good for The Nothing.

<div class="post">
<p>So this is what a hangover feels like? I am sure I've had them before, but I feel it especially this morning. Such a crazy night last night...where do I begin?</p>
<p>I guess it all started with me playing my role as alcohol delegate. I was trying to find SOMEONE who'd get Missy and I some much needed distraction. I was asking Thomas, but I was very polite and understanding when he said he couldn't do it. Missy and I managed though, we went to Package Werehouse to give Missy's new roommate Noa's borrowed fake ID a whirl. She seemed so calm and collected and I was freaking out...it didn't look at all like her! Missy did it too, and I was all talking to her while the lady took her money. We walked out silently and AS SOON as we got a good distance away we started giggling like little freshmen. We were like, "Oh my God! It worked!!!" I called Jeff and told him about it and was saying stuff like, "Yeah, the fake ID worked!!" and we were driving by with the windows open and everyone heard me...sigh, we're a bunch of little innocents, what can I say?</p>
<p>Missy and I took shots in her room...I'm forgetting what we talked about. We did look at SOMETHING that I would love to empart here, it's actually this really good joke that most of my friends know about. Some people are bad kissers... Anyways, aside from teasing unknowing individuals, Missy and I packed up some vanilla Vodka and the Parrot Bay and headed out to Chrissy's party. Missy and I waited a while for the bus doing random bad "immoral" things...once the bus arrived she took a shot of Parrot Bay and I took a shot of Vodka walking over to John's. ICK! Not good. Anyways, the whole bus experience should be a play, I think. I could write a little play about two drunken friends waiting for twenty minutes for the bus. Anyways...I digress.</p>
<p>Walked over to Rivermill and hung out with Rachel for a bit. Gen stopped by...I love Gen! Gen went to the bathroom and IT happened. For the first time in our crazy friendship, Missy and I were seriously considering making out...you know, for instructive purposes. She wanted to know how good she was. I am pretty good, I THINK, you know, I've never been told I was bad except by my first boyfriend who said I was fast, but I've since slowed down. Anyways, we hurridly kissed and really made out sporatically throughout the night. Missy has excellent technique ;-)
<p>Got to Chrissy's party...broke her screen (fixable)...made Rachel a shitty drink...was made a pretty interesting drink by Charlie (you know, dance fucking Charlie)...ate some cookies...looked up Chrissy's dress...Told Rachel I loved her (moreso then ANYONE because I've been there since Day 1). That was the party...we got to Boneshakers and that's when all the shit hit the fan.</p>
<p>The drag show was lame. It's just not fun anymore without Sasha. I was all loud and was happy to see people like Aiman and John. Aiman called me twice last night...I wonder what about...hmmm. Anyways, I got sick of dancing to shit techno (nothing is as interesting as a Wednesday night). I sat and watched people play pool. I talked to Wesley for a while until the making out occured. Like a fog, they descended upon me...Missy, Jeff, and this guy Matt. I made out with all of them, certainly getting strange glares from all onlookers. Sigh...I don't like doing that in public, but whatever, it was alot of fun. We left and went back to Missy's and slept there, Marilia, Jeff, Matt, Missy, and me. I woke up this morning hung over very much...that blows, whatever...</p>
<p>I'm taking medicine so I'll feel better later. Missy and I are going to the store in a bit and then I should probably but some effort to my English term papers. Once those monsters are out of the way, this horrible semester can come to a much appreciated END. I hope I get Thin Mint cookies today. I will try to run 8 miles with Missy too, around 4. I think I'll go to Blue Sky this afternoon and get some reading done and get tickets to MYSTERY CONCERT. I won't share THAT information until I have secured my tickets and am sure to be attending the show. April and Matt will probably show up...God, to spend more then 10 minutes with April, that would be a feat. I mean, beyond bitching about her parents and shit...like actually doing something interesting. I'm really looking forward to that</p>
<p>Ok all, hope that the mystery painful thing that happend to me Wednesday didn't phase you. I'll be fine. I have another thing to post on my desk...in time. In due time. It will all be over soon.
