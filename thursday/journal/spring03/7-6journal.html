<p>Ok, time for a juicy entry. A day in the life. Saturday night was Lindsey's party in Alpharetta. I got off work around 10:30 and snaked my way down East-West Connector until I got to 285. Talked on the phone mostly to Stef about some Board SITUATION. It's being taken care of (Jeremy, I will e-mail you, it's GOOD).</p>
<p>Called Matt for the first of two times. Notable differences. Sober. Driving. Coherent and Inteligent. Also called Gen and Missy to alert them of the good news that I would be arriving shortly. I SHOOK with anticipation at the thought that Missy would be there. I miss her so much.</p>
<p>Arrived and proceeded to hug the best friends. I think I started off with a Daquiri that Lindsay made for me. It was good. Moved onto other things of course. Had 3 shots. A shot of Malibu. A shot of Bacardi. A shot of Stoli (nice Vodka that Taco Mac carries). I tried to light each one of them, but it didn't work. I've gotten cocky since I did the flaming shot of Golden Grain. Well, I did the silly drunken shit. I touched Missy alot, made her all uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Yah, needless to say I got really drunk eventually. Gen got me this puppy that Erica's b/f had. I was so all over this ADORABLE creature, I was so happy just lying on the couch playing with this cute dog named Roxy. I called Matt (second time, much more drunk). I drilled him about cliches. Talked about stuff I always feel ackward about. Whatever, I'll just have to let that one go.</p>
<p>After talking to him, I got really tired and just about fell asleep on the couch. Missy and Gen retrived me and sent me to a nice room upstairs. I fell asleep to random drunk conversations from outside. End of party (for me at least). I am told it went on until 5 a.m. and skinny-dipping was involved.</p>
<p>I woke up in said room freaking out cause no one was around and I was afraid that Lindsay's family had got home and would find random hung-over party-goer in their house. I found Missy, thankfully, and helped Lindsay clean up. Left and went home. Worked. $40. SUCKY.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I'm going to run. I'll probably hang out with Nicole cause she's off too. She's going back to France soon. That pisses me off, I'm going to miss her too much. Not fair. Life sucks sometimes.</p>
<p>The Cure's "The Caterpiller (Flicker Mix)" is my soundtrack of the day. It's beautiful. Goin down Barrett Parkway in the darkness with all those hypnotic "Do's," it's just nice. Nice...</p>
<p align="center"><i>You flicker and you're beautiful<br>
You glow inside my head<br>
You hold me hynotized, I'm mesmerized<br>
Your flames<br>
The flames that kiss me dead...</i><br>

<p>Did you hear Jeremy? Yup, you might be the only one who HASN'T heard. So I went to John Lynch's party last night and it was fun. My friend Nicole came along with me and we saw so many very cool people. It was awesome, most def. So I have a Sprite and Peppermint Snhapps. THEN, guess what. I think it would be a GOOD IDEA to light a shot of GOLDEN GRAIN and SHOOT IT. Yah, I totally did this before, but apparently I did it incorrectly last night. Shoot that sucker all over my face and dropped it on the floor and burned me up a nice piece of John's floor. Yah, NICE.</p>
<p>I went to the ER on the suggestion of my friends. It was probably the best thing. Sure, they gave me a Tetanus shot and told me to use Neospourin, but maybe I was in some sort of danger. Maybe. Thank you Matt and Gen. You all are so sweet to me. I have the best friends ever. Anyways, you'll have to see me in the next few weeks to see my wound. Yes, I am an idiot. I admit it.</p>
<p>Thanks for the postcard Jeremy, you rock.
