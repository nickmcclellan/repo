<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, February 16th...2:16AM...HAPPY BIRTHDAY APRIL!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Wish I could have hung out with Jeff tonight...might have been fun, but it was too late I think. Instead had interesting AIM conversations (plus spent the majority of the evening with Genevieve...whom I love, respect, cherish, and ADORE). <a href="2-16joex2001.htm" target="_blank">Click here</a> to see me and Jeremy's IM conversation. I'll try to put interesting conversations in my journal as I get them.</p>
<p>Taking a break now, 8:05PM on Sunday, from my English paper. It's so boring...I wish I could be doing something much more entertaining. It would be nice if what I have written down turned out to be an excellent paper...that would charge me up so well! To know that despite my downtrodden attitude toward life I was still functioning in an exceptional academic way...that would be comforting. I think I could stand some of that encouragement now. I know that by midnight, I will feel better. I'll probably already, at least mentally, be on Tuesday. Tuesday is my nothing day. I have my journalism lab and then NOTHING. I have to pick up stuff for the office anniversary for Wednesday, but that's about it. I will probably take a nap, that'd be nice. I think I'll take a nap tomorrow actually...well, I digress. Tuesday is also Buffy, that's my escape. Wednesday will come, that will suck like Monday...but I don't have anything due. I will just have to have read the book that we're starting in English. That's not too bad. Wednesday night, I will go out and have fun. Fun. I'll need that this week. Thursday, I will go to creative writing and discuss my poem with the class. I've been looking forward to that especially. Ms. Crowe said it was very "dense"...and she said not in a dumb way! Well, Thursday night I will probably see ER with Gen and have dinner at some point. I will also hopefully make some headway in said English novel we're starting this week. It's Joseph Conrad, you know, <I>Heart of Darkness</i> guy, yah, he's alright. Hope that <I>Lord Jim</i> is as entertaining. Well, I'll go to class Friday...I'll deal with it all...I have this extra make up class on Friday afternoon, that will suck. After that, I may catch dinner with a friend. I have to go home this weekend. I'll drive home sometime Friday night. This weekend I'll do my taxes, play with Lily, collect money from Dad, hang out with the sibling...ponder the future...and then it will all start over again.</p>
<p>Is that my week? That's all there is to it. Like I said, highlights are Tuesday and Wednesday where "fun" could possibly be had. I sure hope so...I want to have some fun. Anyways, today so far I've worked on my paper at the library with Jeff. I helped him out with his speech presentation. He made up some word...it was cute. Anyways, had dinner with some of his friends, they were very sweet. MISSY GOT SOME LAST NIGHT, OH YAH! I didn't get any last night...what's up with that?! I know, gotta catch up, huh. Soon Missy will be the only one talking about sex. Pretty soon, we'll all think Missy's the one who gets some and Nick's the one who NEVER gets any! OMG! This must stop! Well, maybe we can share the distinction of the "friend-who-gets-some." I'd settle for that. Honestly, I don't understand why she never got some before, she's very sexy and versatile...she's on the Crew team :-p</p>
<p>I called April to wish her a Happy Birthday. She was playing <I>Animal Crossing</i> when I called her. I got that for her for Christmas, and she really likes it! That made me happy...especially since on her birthday she was enjoying a present that I had given her. April rocks...I love her. Can't believe that a year ago today I was mad at her...I mean, it was hard growing apart from her and everything, and things have changed alot, but she's awesome. It still hurts that I don't get to talk to her nearly as much as I wish I could. I love April. I must be nothing to her now. The life cycle of friendship blows. It should last forever and ever. It doesn't. One day, Missy will be gone. Gen will be gone. John will be gone. I'll have new friends, wow, I might even be involved in a serious relationship. If only I knew when...John and I were discussing that. When do we get that ONE person to spend the rest of our lives with? I don't need it now, being as jaded as I've become, I can hold back for a while. I know I want it though. I guess I just worry I'll get too old to be desired or I'll become ugly or that some personality defect of mine will repulse every potential guy for me. That's why I'd like to know when. Well...I'd like to know if, actually. Is it going to happen? Is it meant to be?</p>
<p>You can tell I would much rather be moody then write this paper. OMG...Henry James BLOWS, and NOT in a good way. Well, I'm going to continue trucking along. Maybe I can get done early and watch Futurama with my asshole roommate. Yah...AND he started farting today...I know, attractive huh. Well, I guess I'll just have to step it up and bring someone home and have sex while he's in the room...THAT would piss him off. I could be all loud too, say shit like, "Oh, harder...yah, do it baby..." and my roommate will just be freaking out because two guys are having sex...HAHAHA!!! He'd probably kill my Garfield or something...this could be war. Oh well...maybe I'll do that Wednesday, HAHA! We'll see....

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, February 18th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I had an interesting thought while I was coming back to conciousness this morning. There is one "gift" of mine that I have not really put much thought or emphasis on. I've spent the last eight years of my life working at this seemingly pointless endeavor, and maybe it's time I took advantage of my time to ensure it was well spent. I should find employment using my skills in Spanish.</p>
<p>I think it would help me alot. Not only will I get some money, but I will become better at Spanish and probably would do better in class too. I don't have much confidence with my Spanish, but if I jumped into some sort of translation position, maybe I will come into my own. Nothing like emersion to encouage fluentcy. I am thinking of maybe dumping Target and finding something much more lucrative with Spanish this summer. I would love to do that...</p>
<p>My whole vision was that maybe I could have a job and live away from home. Gasp! I could move out! To consider the idea that maybe I could be somewhat independent is invigorating. Maybe that's what's been missing for me these last couple of years. Through high school, I worked alot. I was during my junior year working during the week while I was going to school 5 days a week. That was daunting. I couldn't quite handle that. I really don't want to do something that intensive now. 20 hours a week would be alittle too much. I think that my nature is to be independent. I hate living under the limitations of an allowance. Naturally, I would work more to get more money to my needs and wants are met. Maybe it's time to do that. I'll look into maybe doing something small at first to see exactly what would be appropriate to do for Spanish.</p>
<p>There is something very hauning about Yoshimi...I listened to it during the Winter break, of course. That whole time seems so surreal now, like I wasn't even there. I listen to "In the Morning of the Magicians"...and it's like a dream. It's beautiful, but I envision myself, for one, in a world where the sun never rises. Also, I'm always on the East/West Connector driving to work. It's probably the most surreal present I've ever received. April gave it to me. I try to listen to the Bloody Valentine CD she got me too, but I can never get into it.</p>
<p>Anyways...it's Buffy night tonight. I read the review for the episode and it says, "Buffy's back!" I recognize that the last couple of weeks the episodes have been sorta ick. Oh, one thing before I go. Sunday I'm having a quasi-big update. I'm adding friends pages! I will have pages for the Pad, Charlie, Jeremy, Sonya, Ilya, and Thom. Now all internet stalkers can get to know even more intimate details about me. Alright, I'm off to prepare for the office anniversary thing...yah, ok...later.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, February 19th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Feeling all reflective, so here goes. Thom said I seemed pessimistic. He told me this last night in light of how I've been acting. Sure, yeah, it's true. I'm not pessimistic, per se, though. I mean, I would say jaded, and I don't think it's a bad thing. Sure, it would be nice to feel like I'm being handed everything I need to be content, but it's not happening. I feel like I know how the game works and I don't want to play along. I want to sit out for a while and enjoy the benfits of being a wallflower. I figure something really nice is going to come along soon, so when that comes, maybe I'll be in a lighter mood. I'm fine and all, just a bump in the road. More like when you're driving and you cross into another county and you can tell they don't spend much on roads cause all of a sudden the car starts vibrating on the shitty road beneath you. I'm just passing through the Paulding County of life right now. I'll be in Gwinnett after a while.</p>
<p>Going to nap now for a while...not sure if I want to do Bones tonight or not...depends on if I come across something more interesting. We'll see. Later gators.</p>

<font face="verdana" size="1"><a href="http://hope.falling-star.org/donnieq.html">Which Donnie Darko character are you?</a> by <a href="http://www.hope.falling-star.org">Shay</a></font></font>
<p align="center">Congratulations, you are Donnie Darko. You're not afraid to speak what's on your mind and tell people what you're really thinking. You think about sex a lot and sometimes you wake up with your hands down your pants.</p>
<p>I wish I got psycho purple bunnie rabbit. Why can't I be the psycho??? :-(</p>
<p>Allyson said that I was so genuine and that it was rare to find that in someone. That was really sweet of her, she is the coolest person I know in Athens, that's for sure. There is mutual "missing" shared between us...no more Bitch Reynolds classes to keep us together...sigh...</p>
<p>GRRRR....I SO SHOULD HAVE GONE TO BONESHAKERS!!! What was I thinking??? Oh, sure, I could get some sleep tonight...RIGHT...because THAT'S fun...sigh. I'll probably start on that in a minute I guess. Feel like bitching though. I'm going to have a boring chunk of days...obviously going to have to take the next opportunity at something interesting. I don't like going home, it's so boring and pointless. I love Lily, I sorta like the family, but as far as fun and boys are concerned...NOTHING! This summer might be more fun, I seem more in touch with the community. I'll probably explore the gay community in Atlanta with John's help of course. I certainly couldn't do it by myself. Dating in the summer...that would be interesting, I've never done that. Well...I just want to have something to do...grrrr. Jeremy asked me to go...so did Marilia...and I just said no...now I'm stuck in my boring room. At least I can get some sleep tonight. I might go running tomorrow afternoon before class. Thursday night I have plans with Gen, ER and such. Friday, NOTHING so far, I would like to do something though before I have to go home. I have to finalize Spring Break plans with the Gang first at least (the Gang being Sonya, Ilya, and Missy). I mean...next week...EWWW, Spanish test on Monday. Uck, five days of miserable nothing...what else is new.

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, February 19th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I just came across some interesting information...seems that Dragonball Z will finally show the concluding episodes of the series starting March 17th, 2003. Sigh...the obsession will likely begin again. Oh, what will I do...</p>
<p>Hmmmm...what do I say? I just don't know...I've got nothing! Absolutely nothing. Oh, I will share one thing. I had a nightmare last night! I slept a whole lot last night. It was great, the nightmare was actually an interesting twist. In my dream, apparently I was at home. My sister was upstairs and I was with my dad downstairs in some crawlspace or something. I went upstairs and someone was knocking on the door real fast and loud. My sister was like, "Go away! Go away!" We were both real scared. Then, the person started to open the door. My sister starts to scream, "OH MY GOD, HE'S COMING IN!!!" I run to the stairs to tell my dad that someone is coming inside the house. He comes running upstairs to stop them. The most interesting and scary aspect of the dream was the fact that I didn't see this person that was invading my home. My sister and dad saw them, but I always looked away at the last moment. I woke up alittle scared, it was early in the morning, probably 4 or 5AM. I went back to sleep. It was nice to know I had a good chunk of hours to sleep. Very nice.</p>
<p>Oh! I know what I have to say, so here goes...</p>
<p><a href="../../poems/separation.html" target="_blank"><B>Separation</b></a>: My poem "Separation" is a very complicated piece. The reader may find alot of the devices I have "hidden" inside of it very hard to find. I am not sure if this is because they aren't apparent or that the major themes of the poems help to hide them, but there are formal patterns my creative writing class found very difficult to see. The first of which ties to the title. I have "separated" pleasant and dark instances from eachother. The poem's major theme is of course pain, and that seems to permeate into even the pleasant passages. This was simply a formal starting point for me, I guess. There are other intentional patterns in the poem. I repeat many key images. "Ceiling", "Thursday", "warmth/cold", and "seven stars" are all repeated. "Thursday" is only mentioned once, but its significance lies in "Separation's" thematic similarities to my earlier poem "Thursday." Plus the events of the two poems happened on the same day of the week. "Ceiling" is repeated in the poem but also appears in my earlier poem "Locked Inside." Exploration of that poem would be adventageous. My creative writing class commented that I had many strengths in "Separation." I was told that I avoided many cliches and my themes and images were fresh and original. I seem to have a knack for blood imagery, which appears in "Separation." There was some confusion over the word "impregnable" which was tied to a greater confusion over the meaning of the ninth stanza. YES, it's a sexual experience. That makes "impregnable" seem to mean some sort of intercourse, but it doesn't. It actually ties into "Locked Inside" as well. In "Locked Inside", the speaker laments over not being able to "let someone in." The speaker's space seems "impregnable." The "you's" in "Separation" have overcome the barriers of "Locked Inside." That's the significance of the word "impregnable." Other confusion surrounded the line, "you look so fine." The verb tense of that line does not match the majority of tenses in the first stanza. Actually, the line, "you look so fine" is an allusion to the garbage song "You Look So Fine." It's signifance lies partly in that...but the power of those words, "you look so fine" also seems to mix up things for the reader. It introduces the idea that in this poem not everything will be as it seems. Not all grammatical and punctuational rules will be followed. As far as the rest of the poem, I'll just let the reader decide what he or she says. There is one thing I will admit though. The closing stanza, "Close your eyes / and listen... / I don't love you" is spoken by the speaker, not the "you" in the poem. In fact, at no point is the "you" in the poem speaking. There is one speaker throughout the entire poem. One more thing. The significance of my punctuation choices all have significance. Every one of them. Let me know if you think you have figured something out. This poem was alot of fun to write, it was like tearing apart a memory and scattering the pieces onto a piece of paper. Now let's see if you are able to put them back together.</p>
<p>So look for that on Sunday. Also look for more friends pages. Ok, I'm out...later gators.

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, February 22nd...1AM</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Sigh, if I dwell on this...I'm just going to get pissy. Seems like popular ol' me was invited to a FUCKING FUN gay party THAT INCLUDED the ILLUSTRIOUS presence of my PRECIOUS RACHEL MILLS. She's a celebrity. Well, sigh, I couldn't drink because I had to go home. This is where I am now...boring...ol'...FUCKING...Marietta. I listened joyfully to my Ultimate B-sides CD (from garbage, of course) all the way home and got in around 12:45AM. Rachel called me just as I was starting to think of my sweet Lily Bell waiting patiently for my arrival. She said she wished I was at the party...and OMG I should have been there. Sigh...must not dwell, you know...I've got to invest in this weekend at home. One less weekend I'll have to stay away from Athens.</p>
<p>Anyways, I suppose I should put this week into some sort of perspective. I think it was pretty good. I was thinking about all that on my way back. This week, I got an 88 on my Spanish essay and I also got rave "reviews", per se, from my poem "Separation." That was more of a "No Duh" empowerment, I think. I fucking rock at poetry, I know this. Creative writing has giving me an opportunity to force people to read my poetry. Obviously having a poem page on my website has not yielded any serious readers. I think I could write a book of poems. By the end of this whole college trek I'm sure I could have a good book. A nice progression. Sigh...if only being a poet could make me rich and carefree. This is not the world we live in. At least my words are beautiful. They are my most precious gift.</p>
<p>This week, I've decided to title the journal "Going Through the Motions." I continue to feel this way. I'm not sure, but is this my eight journal of the semester? If it is, this would be an interesting turning point. I think it's the seventh though. Whatever, I just noticed that every four journal entries seem to symbolize a distinct slice of my life. It would be nice if at the end of my second slice of this semester I recieved some sort of absolution. I'm still waiting on that. I continue to walk through the part. Sure, I am functioning normally. I've got things going for me. One thing impaticular...</p>
<p>Something good is coming. I felt that today, this week in general. I feel that raw power still inside...it's waiting. I'm not empty. I may be, you know, figurativly "busted up," but I am still alive. So alive! I deserve what's coming. If I have to go through hell to get it, I don't care, I'm waiting patiently for it to come. It will come, you'll see, and when it gets here, I'll tell you. You will all know that I've recieved my absolution. My key to it all.</p>
<p>Well, I'll wait for that to happen, whenever that may be. Sigh...this isn't home anymore...
