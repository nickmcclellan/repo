<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, April 6th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>The retreat, all in all, was very successful. This weekend will forever be known as the weekend I didn't do a damn thing for class but everything for Lambda. This coming week I SHOULD be spending every night working very diligently on Trivedi's paper (aka THE END OF THE WORLD). I had a nice dinner with Stefanie and Marilia last night. We made Shake and Bake (and I helped!), mushrooms and green peppers, and also garlic toast. Marilia especially enjoyed the garlic toast. It was alot of fun, we talked forever about a whole bunch of crap. I feel very close to certain members on the new board. I will have to have some sort of closer relationships to Eric, Aiman, and Milo--I feel the farthest from them all. We have many goals and hopefully at the next board meeting we will be able to communicate them to eachother.</p>
<p>Last night I watched "Kissing Jessica Stein" with Gen and John. Interesting, all in all, I didn't get drunk, which I'm sure you will agree is a welcome variation. I'm seriously not an alcoholic! Eric made a good point this weekend saying that someone that drinks Everclear like I do must really not enjoy drinking and really must enjoy being drunk. I think that sums it up, except for one thing. I enjoy being drunk with people I'm close to. A night drunk with Missy is a fun night, no matter what!</p>
<p>Today is Athens Pride and I will be attending with the board. Grumble grumble...now that I think about it, despite running my 5K yesterday, I really should run my 4 miles for today. I did have lots of cookies and ice cream yesterday. What's up with that, yo. Anyways, off I go for a Sunday of fun (and torture).

<p>Hello! I'm just alittle tipsy now, but I had a really fun night! I went to Bill's surprise birthday party, it was alot of fun, all of my friends were there and I got some Everclear with various other sweet drinks. After this, my sexy roommate-to-be Marilia took me to Boneshakers where I shoke my bone. This was a joy, though I was very drunk and don't remember much. I danced with Marilia alot and when I heard "Hot in Herre", I took off all my clothes! Well, I actually took off my shirt and sported my grey tank top, it was the first time I've ever done something like this. It was really great. I thought I was a very sexy individual AND I recieved the wonderful news that I will be graduating from the University of Georgia tonight! I actually SAW Michael Stipe! Finally!!! It was awesome, I know alot of people have seen him, but now I have seen him and I no longer need to seek the Stipe.</p>
<p>It's too bad not many people besides my normal crew came out. You all suck, those who didn't make it. I had a great time. By the way, I've downloaded alot of really cool songs this week. Blue Sky plays alot of music I find very cool to download. This week, I've downloaded New Order, "Crystal" (I used to have it, lost it when my computer crashed), Depeche Mode's "Everything Counts", "Enjoy the Silence", and "I Feel Loved", David Bowie's "Modern Love", and most importantly Mono's "Life in Mono." It's all new age, but I don't care. Give me a break, man!</p>
<p>Anyways, give me a halla, yo! Things have been really rough but they are getting better. Things have been difficult, but I'm about to make them easier on myself. Life can really blow, but you know what, fuck that. If I'm not having fun, I'm not involved in that shit. I may elaborate later when things have materialized as I hope they will. Have a good week all, enjoy this April the Tenth!</p>

<p>Hello again! Now it's the afternoon, and I must admit, this is the best afternoon I've had in a long while. This afternoon I found out that I have recieved a scholarship! I got a $700 scholarship to Grady, and I feel absolutely amazing about that. I called my mom and dad and felt like a million bucks, it was great. Along with this, I recieved a letter from my BEST FRIEND Nicole (btw, that's NOT a shot at Missy in any way...it's more like an homage to Nicole who truly is a best friend). Nicole sent me chocolate and with <b>THREE LETTERS</b> and also a picture of a cute guy. Now I have my first picture of a cute guy on my wall (I'm such a neglectful homosexual).</p>
<p>In other news, I lost my ID at the Tate center today. Someone probably found it and used all the money on it, and if that's a case, I'm sorry, but I will be very upset. I think it's insane that people can be that inconsiderate. Oh well, I hope they will enjoy eternal hell-fire. I also turned into my creative writing class my creative non-fiction piece titled "Blog." I worked very hard on this and it's very long and, I think, a very meaingful stab at non-fiction. I was very pleased with it. I also looked at a townhouse today with Sexy Marilia (her full name). I liked it, we're going to discuss possibly renting it on Sunday. Maybe this search is almost over...</p>
<p>Anyways, on the subject of "Blog", I took 3 entries from my Blog over the last year and expanded them into creative non-fiction essays. I used "Simple", "Separation", and "Going Through the Motions." It worked very well though I wish I had more time on it. I think I might send a copy of the story to Nicole to see what she thinks. I definitely want to send her something, she's so cool and dead sexy, I wish I was having sex with her right now...HAHAHA!!!</p>
<p>Tonight is the traditional Blue Sky evening. I'll be going with Vicki and Gen, both sexy ladies. I am going to start that FRICKIN <b>800 page</B> novel...that's going to be ALOT OF FUN, let me tell you. I'll write a letter to Nicole...listen to mp3's, blah blah. I usually make a new playlist on Thursdays. Last week, it was a depressing playlist for some reason...I think it's because I was doing that creative non-fiction thing and it was becoming a very depressing story, so I, in turn, became depressed as well. Tonight, though, I feel so good! I'm going to enqueue so many fun songs. Definitely going to hit up some cheerful Cure songs...no more of this "Lullaby" shit. That song is creepy...if I heard that when I was in a crib, I would shit my diapers, that's for damn sure! Anyways, off I go. Come by and see me if you have a life or something interesting to say or do ;-)

<p>Thankfully, I found my ID this morning and the money was still there. Much thanks to the good person who turned it in--you rock! This day is turning out to be alright.</p>
<p>Poor Missy is sick with the flu (probably). After finishing a SIX PAGE letter to Nicole (front and back), I left Blue Sky for Kroger where I got for Missy some TheraFlu and some diet Sprite. She has this thing for diet Sprite, she only chases Vodka with that particular soft drink, what's up with that?! Anyways, I hope she'll feel better.</p>
<p>The letter was very important to me to write. I refused to leave Blue Sky until I had gotten out everything I wanted to say. The things Nicole wrote to me, there were incredible! I think it's so amazing that despite this ocean that separates us, we still somehow manage to make a meaningful connection. I can't wait to see her again, she's obviously changed in so many ways. She's at least one thing about this coming summer I really can't wait to experience.</p>
<p>Blah blah, I'm off...you'll just have to do random things this evening if you're going to find out what I'M doing, because I'M NOT TELLING! HAHAHAHA!
