<p>Long weekend. No food. Lots of money. Let me count now.</p>
<p>$280. One week, $280. That's just from Thursday night until now. Wow...good times. I have until July 7th to blitz that credit card and I'm gonna do it. Tomorrow, gotta do it again.</p>
<p>Interesting night tonight. I got a phone number! I know, that doesn't matter ONE BIT and the guy wasn't that cute, but the fact that I am being hit on by the customers means something. I love Matt...yah, I said I loved him...and I'm not fucking with that. So totally exclusive.</p>
<p>Feeling good about this, so I'll go...yah, I told Matt that I loved him--and you know, it wasn't the first time. I came to the conclusion a few weeks ago that I loved Matt before I started dating him. That's what made the idea of dating Matt so appealing! I already loved him, I already cared very much about him, dating him really didn't bring about any new feelings for him. Dating him has just reinforced them. Thinking about him calms me, he's the one thing that actually makes some sort of sense. Seeing him smile...seeing him happy, knowing that in some feeble way I'm contributing to it, well, that just makes me feel fantastic, so yah. I love Matt.</p>
<p>Other stuff...nice couple drew me a picture of Trogdor the Burninator. That's really cool. Guy that gave me his number left me a good tip. I feel bad, I feel like I should call him to tell him I'm dating someone. Maybe he'd appreciate that...hehe, I don't think I'd do it. Well, anyways, it was busy tonight. Hopefully it will be busy this week. Fo sho.</p>
<p>Anyways, gotta wake up and do it again. Wish me luck. Call me, tell me you love me. Might be Athens side on Tuesday night...depends on if Nicole will come along with me. Would love to see Matt, but I don't want to drive to and from if I'm not doing something "different", you know? Gotta have a reason to see the BOYFRIEND (last time I'll say that...that word is just weak)

<div class="post">
<p>Fuck me. I don't care how late it is. I've enjoyed my AFTERNOON off I suppose. Slept through most of it. Lunched with the sister. Have missed her all weekend. Saw Bibi too (calling her Bibbity...maybe Bitty, need better nicknames). Bibi is so cool. She might move in with us. How cool is that?? How many people can say they had a sexy lady move in with them this summer? Only me, yup, only me.</p>
<p>Actually am probably going to Athens tomorrow. Taking Nicole to show her my digs and to introduce her to my friends. First objective is to introduce her to the illustrious Missy and Genevieve, my bestest friends in the world. We'll probably do Transmet since I know Nicole is strapped money wise. Athens is so cool. I want to play a drinking game, but I'm not sure exactly how GAME Nicole or anyone else is. Plus, am working sorta on Wednesday (pretty sure it's Wednesday night, better check, huh). I hope it's fun.</p>
<p>Depressing afternoon. Turns out all those high Cingular bills are to be blamed on my big mouth. I am not going to be making daytime calls until July 7th, so please don't tempt me. I got voice mail for you kiddies, though, so now you can leave me a message. Yes, Jeremy, I conformed.</p>
<p>That's another subject all together. I miss Jeremy, I think about him often, ever since he called me. Probably should funnel this journal writing energy into an e-mail for him (or at least a good stab at reading some of his) but I can't stand whatever time I get on this damned dial up garbage (not good garbage). Jeremy is so cool. Last week I was talking to an OL who knew him and she said he was really cool, and I knew it was true, because Jeremy is one of my best friends, and my summer has been lacking because I can't see him or talk to him. I can't wait for the fall when he and I can become better acquainted, though I know we are already pretty ok now.</p>
<p>Yah, depressing cause it seems all my hard work has paid the bills, but it hasn't improved my long term goals (yet). I just see me killing myself working, yet again, and coming out of this with all this debt, maybe $500 for myself, and none of the perky extras I so desire. Clothes would be nice...but yah, I need more money, more money! I'm working as hard as I can, I am trying. July. It's only thirty-one days, and I need more than that. I need more.</p>
<p>Bascially, the point of this entry is that I still need. Yah, that sounds about right. I may be all self-sufficient, resiliant, and just fucking amazing (I know, I know...) but I still need some, you know, just alittle. A break. An afternoon on the Silver Comet Trail. A phone call. Yah, fuck the minutes, a phone call would be nice. Even if I don't pick up, there are other phones. Nicer phones that don't steal my money. Call me, please, it would have really felt good tonight. Very good. Yah, better than this...</p>
<p>BTW, the gym shorts I stole from my ASSHOLE roommate in Mary Lyndon are absolutely wonderful. Garfield never felt this good!</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Tonight, Missy and Gen are going to come see me at Taco Mac. Granted, it's not as SPONTANEOUS as seeing Matt, Barry, and John sitting in my section a few weeks ago, but despite that, I'm really looking forward to it. Tonight I'm working a late shift, and lately I've felt very weary with serving in general. The last week, I've worked my little ass off. I haven't had a day off since I went to Athens last week. Tomorrow, however, that changes.</p>
<p>I suppose I can understand why something like Atlanta Pride would be a big deal, honestly, I wouldn't know personally, but I'm really not looking forward to it THAT much. Don't get me wrong, I have pride. I'm the frickin' Administrative Director of a college GLBT student group! It's just, my reasons are different than Pride. I'm not involved in Lambda because I have this incredible LOVE for the gay lifestyle and all it's merits. I'm involved in Lambda because I love the people and I want to make my contribution. Pride is simply a fundraising event, nothing more. Another opportunity to help out.</p>
<p>Oh, and I hear it's supposed to be fun. Outside of my noon to 4 fundraising run, I have no idea what I'm going to be doing. I'm staying over at Gen's tonight. Saturday night too, maybe Matt will come. I'm looking forward to seeing my friends and avoiding all NIGHTMARES involving table serving. Anyways, the point is I'll be off this weekend and beyond--until Thursday of next week. That's pretty cool. I'm going back up to Athens next week to do orientations and to do the inventory for the office. Fun times.</p>
<p>This week has been AWESOME Pride-wise. I mean, I just need to point that out. Apparently it's not legal for us degenerate homosexuals to FUCK in the privacy of our own homes (like sodomy laws stopped that anyways). Also, I hear that that bastard conservative Strom Thurmond finally got his dirt nap. Happy trails buddy. See you in hell.</p>
<p>Last crack. "One of..." What does that mean? Is this just one of those weeks? Am I just one of your best friends? One of the best? One of those days? One of those songs? One of what? What does that mean? Am I doomed to be one of or am I destined for something more? And why the hell does this have to be another one of those lame ass journal entries? Whatever. You haven't had this much to munch on in a while. Get over it. Like you were under it, right? Right.
