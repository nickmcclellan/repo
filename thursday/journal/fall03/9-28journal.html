<div class="post">
<p>I had a good day, kinda feeling pressured as of late. Hopefully I'll see it through. This weekend there was a surprise party for Stef. That was tons of fun, I suppose. My dedication to not drinking has been holding through. It's nice not having a hangover the next day. Oh, but I've been tempted...Chip seems all into having a Toga Party sometime soon which I think sounds very appealing. I mean, I should totally get trashed. He seems apt to having it during my birthday week, which seems like a plan, but I'd rather not be involved in a party for my birthday...it is my belief that that is Missy and Gen's responcibility, no one else's. I'll put this out there now--I want a party!</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm really tired and lazy, I don't think I'll read...I'll do my editing stuff tomorrow. Now it's sleep time. I'll leave you with one thing...very funny.</p>

<p>September is NOT over...</p>
<p>Anyways, someone keeps calling me...they keep calling me when I'M IN CLASS or when I'M SLEEPING. I think this was the cause of me waking up this morning so confused from apparently hearing my "Just Like Heaven" ringtone in my sleep. This incessant calling is only mildly annoying, I just hope it's important.

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, October 2nd...HAPPY BIRTHDAY STEFANIE AND LINDSAY!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>What is up with me? I haven't updated nearly as often as you'd expect me to. Maybe it's because I've grown tired of this...yes, blogging is fun, but the whole "update-on-my-life" thing is just tired. Who gives a shit what I'm doing, the only reason anyone comes her is for gossip, criticism, and boredom. I find it all very intrusive. What would you like me to say? I am thinking that I will give you something that will just blow your socks off! Ok, here's the truth...</p>
<p>I secretly hate Padmini.</p>
<p>Anyways, that's not true, but ANYWAYS, my english mentor seemed kinda insane today, he almost had me all motivated to do something meaningful today, but I decided instead to come home and sleep. Should be doing that now...so yah. I am really into doing for my honors thesis something creative writing-like. Maybe a book? I could do a book. I'd need to find a good subject, that would be crucial. I haven't been writing as of late, and my idea for a poem I was thinking about over the summer "All I've Ever Wanted" kinda fizzled. Eh, something depressing is bound to come my way any day now...</p>
<p>By the way, I know you weren't at Boneshakers last night, and you don't need to excuse yourself. You're excused. Sometimes I wonder if you really love me, but whatever. I'll get on without YOU. At least April was there ;-)</p>
<p>And April does NOT need to be told she's sexy. Sexy for April is a state of mind, sexy for April is as trivial as mittens.

<p>A shadow beneath me<br>
Covets, persistant and needing<br>
hold me <i>still<br>
release</i> me<br>
<br>
the earth kisses<br>
holding a dead man, for a moment<br>
before he sees that which kills him<br>
pushed him beneath<br>
<br>
"Release me," he said, smiling.<br>
hearing him, I could forget my struggle<br>
tossing him a penny--<br>
a beat--I could only make him smile<br>
<br>
and all this trouble<br>
because I<br>
<i>loved</i><br>
him...</p>

<p>I found my keys! I don't even think I mentioned here that I lost them. I lost them Monday in the office and I thought I had left them in the Lambda closet door. I thought that someone had come along, grabbed them, and stuck them in some lost in found somewhere. I went around EVERYWHERE! I've never been in the Psychology building, but I ventured in there none-the-less to see if someone in Memorial had taken my keys that way. I think I went to Tate alot this week--maybe 5 times.</p>
<p>ANYWAYS, I found them in the Lambda Office (big surprise!) They were stuck in one of the turning chairs, and I remember thinking, "Hmmm, I didn't look there..." and I looked and they were there! It was amazing, I called Genevieve because it was all her fault in the first place (I found her keys when we had that super fun night at Bones our first year...so her Karma is BEGGING to help me out). She didn't answer her phone >:O Anyways, she'll get hers...</p>
<p>This weekend, I have to come up with a game plan for my Tuesday night social event at Boneshakers. Yah, if ANYONE wants to help me, please do. Also, Saturday will be alot of fun. Jen is coming to town with some stuff of mine and she may come tailgating with me, then maybe to the football game, then HOPEFULLY to Krush Girls. She's notorious for getting sleepy though and LAMING up the evening. Well, I like my sister, I can't wait for her to come.</p>
<p>Tonight, I'd like to go to the Grit with Parker and April. Then I'd like to go home then and clean my room, it's a sty. Relaxing might be the best idea, I've had an exhausting week. Last night was movie night at April's, that's always fun because I get to see Rainey and Jeff, who are very cool. We should have movies at my house too :-)</p>
<p>Anyways...I must depart...I leave you with this (and you're going to have to imagine that I pulled this off, I'm feeling less than my creativa persona): April's supreme SeXy and you're just going to have to call me to talk about it...

<p>I have not explained a Blog title for a while, so maybe now's a good time. "Still" because, for one, I like that it's the shortest title I've had since probably "Simple." It just looks appropriate. "Still" also because of that strange impromptu poem I spit out early Friday morning. What did you think of that? So much I wanted to say there, I had no idea the form would come out that way, but I'm pleased with it. So yah, "Still."</p>
<p>One more thing...isn't it fun to stick in the AIM names of old crushes into google to see what strange places they appear? Yah, I think so...I just did Greg and Nathan (remember, Kroger bagger guy), and I found more on Nathan than I had thought, it was just funny, and I found someone in GA mention something about Greg. Interesting...provocotive o:-)
