<div class="post">
<p>I went to lunch with April Smith today. It was fun, I love that girl. We've been through alot. I remember last year I was in this mood to write her off because I felt like she was too obsessive over Matt. This time around, she's calling Matt, asking it if she spends her first day off in a while with me instead of her. It's nice to know sometimes I am wrong. It's more often than I let on, I'm sure.</p>
<p>After hanging w/ April, I had this intense desire to shop. I need pants, I've needed pants for months, and it's time to get some. So, yah, I realized that since Nicole has left and April had to go to work, I don't have that many friends Marietta side to do fun stuff with. I tried Tee and Quiana! Not that they are bad, it's just I never call them. I tried to at least visit w/ Quiana tonight, but I think I will do it Wednesday instead. She was washing her hair. She's awesome. I talked to Tee for over an hour, it seemed. She works at Red Roof Inn across from Town Center. We talked about our crazy friends from high school.</p>
<p>I'm so excited about Thursday! Everything is coming together perfectly! I will be just fine, at long last, I will be in my own place. How cool is that? Marilia and Milo are moving in Thursday as well, as far as I know. It's going to be a strange adjustment. I don't know how I feel about going back to all this.</p>
<p>Last year, things were so different. Moving into Mary Lyndon was an adventure because my best friend Missy was living upstairs and we were dedicated to having a kickass year. I also really didn't know anyone at all. I had been marginally involved in Lambda the year before, so my second year offered for me a whole new world of people and opportunities. This year, I just don't feel that. I know there will be alot of new people, but for the most part, I've already made my friends. I'm feeling this weight upon me. I'm older now, an established upperclassman. I'm getting to a point where undergraduate antics will certainly damage any positive strides in the future I intend to establish for myself. It's hard deciding when exactly it's appropriate to grow up. Maybe that's what this year is. Growing up.</p>
<p>We'll just have to see. Thursday, I plan to move. Thursday night I'm going to go out w/ friends. Missy's going away to Cali for a while before classes start. This weekend, my big stuff will be moved to Athens by my Dad. I want to purchase a washer and dryer this weekend. Next week I need to clean up the office and come up with some game plan to recruit office volunteers. Off the top of my head, I'm thinking I may try to get a schedule running of Board members and trusted volunteers. This way, I can fill the other spaces with new people. Barry wants to schedule volunteers this semester, so I will definitely need to let him in on my methods.</p>
<p>August 14th we're having the cookout. That will be a busy day. I suppose I'll be running around with friends before classes. And, oh yah, classes...those are important too.</p>
<p>On a side note, I've noticed our "War on Terror" has done something productive for once. After raids on Al-Quida operatives turned up evidence that future terrorists attacks on the US could be implemented with modified small electronic-looking weapons, the FAA has sent out a warning to airports across the nation to check these objects more thouroughly than usual. I think this is very good. When I went to Ohio last week, I was really annoyed that airport security went psycho over stuff like big shoes and sharp objects. These things terrorist know they can't get through with because we already know about them! The fact that actual inteligence has changed security messures in the States is the type of action we need to realistically protect our nation from further attacks. Good Job Uncle Sam!</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm through for now. Maybe I should go to bed...big shopping day and all tomorrow. Fun times...

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, August 6th...12:36 a.m.</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Today I had a really nice day. My sister, Bibi, BARRY, and I went shopping at Town Center. I bought a shitload. I started off w/ some much needed boxer shorts. They are nice and comfy, and just beautiful! I'm so very tickled to have new threads. I didn't plan on getting anything more than boxers and shorts, but I got 2 really excellent shirts. One dressy shirt from Rich's...and the find of the day! Another Mario shirt! Yes, from Gadzooks, it is green w/ a green 1UP mushroom on it. It's amazing, absolutely wonderful. I love all my most excellent t-shirts. I guess I can wear that one Thursday for the move.</p>
<p>I bounced my first transaction this weekend. I got the notice in the mail today, I was so pissed, I am a very studious banker, so I had the bank on the phone talking to them about it because I had thought everything was just fine. As a courtesy, they removed the charge, so I am very pleased with Bank of America right now. (Shit, I didn't pay my cell phone bill again...I'll have to do that tomorrow morning w/ everything else I've got to do).</p>
<p>Tomorrow: banking, packing, CELL PHONE BILL, last night at T-Mac (goodbye Fiona and Amber!), visit w/ Quiana, wear new boxers :-*

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, August 7th...2:25 a.m., It's here</h2>
<div class="post">
<p><u>Moving Crisis #1</u>: My sister has decided not to help me move at all tomorrow. This of course fucks up my plans royally. Dealing though...
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Friday, August 8th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Most of my stuff is here. The move was successful. I dealt with my sister's stab in the back quite well. I had to take two trips though which kinda ruined plans of me having people over, but Matt came, so that was probably enough. I took my aunt's van. It was quite an adventure too.</p>
<p>I hit the sack at 3:30 in the morning after moving all my stuff into the living room (all disassembled, as to facilitate my dad easily moving it for me this weekend). I also cleaned all my clothes, folded them, and put them in my largest suitcase.  This is especially important because Milo, Marilia, and I still haven't located a washer or dryer. Well, my slumber was short lived because I had to wake up at 7:30 in order to mow the grass by 8:30, when I planned to call my aunt for help. I mowed and cleaned up nicely. Aunt Kitty is naturally an early bird, so I was very lucky that she wasn't sleeping so early in the morning. Well, I made my way over to east Cobb quickly to acquire her very large van. She fed me, and I left my packed car at her place to return home to fetch some of my bigger things.</p>
<p>Wow, I knew moving the bed and bedroom suite would be tough, and hopefully the toughest part of that ordeal is past me now. The box-spring just would not fit in the van, so I had an idea. I could put it on the top of the van! It was ambitious; I'd never secured anything to the top of a vehicle before, knowing surely that it had made it to its destination (let alone that the destination was clear across three interstates! I had tied stuff down at Target before, but they were to places very close to the store). Well, I tied several knots and stuffed everything else I could into the van. Called my dad, and I was out the door. You may have heard me say a silent prayer as I raced up the hill with my box-spring bouncing along on the top of the van.</p>
<p>I-285 was probably the worst. I watched that thing more than the road! I swear, everytime I hit a bridge, the bed would bounce, and I'd get so nervous. It was like my heart dropped everytime. But, no matter how much it bounced and flew to the side slightly, it never came unsecure. I think around I-85 I decided that worrying about it did nothing, so I might as well accept that I was just going to have to have faith that I'd make it to Athens with everything in tow. And I did just that :-)</p>
<p>It seemed the trip had heightened when the Retroplex came on 99X. Their intro music had promises of The Smiths "Hang the DJ" and A-ha's "Take on me." After the first three or four songs, I was about to change the channel...they played the lamest shit! Who the hell is Wang Chung? WTF?! Anyways, I'm romping into Athens on 316, and I hear this lady's e-mail about how she loved hearing the Smiths the day before and how she would like to here The Cure's "Pictures of You"...AND I NEARLY BURST. HOLY SHIT, I WAS INSTANTLY AWAKE AND JUBILATED! I swear, I had never been so psyched and into a song EVER. It was just that I'd had such a shitty ride over listening to shitty music (I didn't know how to function my aunt's CD player) and I was also fading conciousness-wise. It was a real boost. I love that song.</p>
<p>Well, I arrived. Moved shit in. Left w/ van and Marilia. She got me lunch, we had a nice conversation. I'm going to love having roommates I know this year. Anyways, left Mickey-D's w/ Marilia and van. Arrived at her abode (very nice place). Moved her shit in (fucking daybed from HELL!). Moved shit to our place. Got icecream w/ Stef (seems Stef was attacked by an animal of the str8 male variety this weekend...interesting story). We got back to our place after Marble Slab and drifted apart once more.</p>
<p>I went back to my aunt's house to drop off her van and get my car. She fed me once more, but this time w/ spaghetti sauce and spaghetti (NOT COOKED!). Well, after the long drive back with shit-mobile, I munched on some very delicious sauce and just gazed at the hard pasta. Oh well. My night here at Highland Park, I assembled my bed and put out our plates and such. My room is mostly assembled. I'm waiting on my dresser, desk, a bed stand, a book shelf, and a recliner chair for the living room (We have a shitload of "stand-alone chairs" though, I don't know where I'm going to put it). I realized last night I left my Trogdor shirt at home. This was the source of most of my late evening dread. I guess I'll have my dad get it for me. Hope he can find it.</p>
<p>Well, after the dread, it was off to bed! And that was my move. I was tired most of the day, but I made it. I did a shitload of work, and now I have my own place to show for it. I was looking at kitchen last night, giggling at the fact that it was mine! All of it, my place, not my dad's, not my sister's, MINE! My own room, my own bathroom, everything is just awesome.</p>
<p>Ok, for now, I'm going to dress and maybe go see Jeani and pay my rent. I've got alot to do today. We need to buy alot of start-up stuff like ice trays and paper towels...rags and stuff. I'd like to sit down w/ the roomies and go over some stuff...I feel like I'm in charge of this, telling people what to do, and I think it should be more of a team effort. Milo seems pretty self-aware though, so that's good, and Marilia is coming around. Maybe it's not so bad after all.</p>
<p>Now, off I go! Come by and see the place...seriously. Yell for me though, apparantly I can't hear the doorbell from my room :-/

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, August 9th...</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Finally settled on a title for my first journal clump. It's hard because the last two clumps have started off w/ "Return to UGA" and "Return to UGA Pt. 2." That title was significant, I think, because it was the first time I had to return, and also the second time. It's like coming back to something you've done before, so you know almost exactly what's going to happen, but at the same time it's new and interesting. This time, the third time around, it's different. I'm all by myself.</p>
<p>I've begun to think of this college adventure as a pyramid. It's nice being at the bottom. Nobody knows you and everything is new. You're young and the sun shines from below. It's all fine and good for a time, but you step up and leave this plane behind. Second time around, things are different. It's still fun, but there's this quality about the situation that's different. Suddenly, it's not so new and exciting. Also, it's easier to get wrapped in the shadow of the situation--forgotten among nothing. I feel like I'm rising and soon I'll be gone. It's not like this is necessarily a bad thing. I have this life in front of me that I really should start paying more attention to that has the potential to be quite exciting. It's just that this place, this place where I feel good and warm, I'm out growing it.</p>
<p>I don't want to be the type of person that sticks around. I want to grow and change. At the same time, I don't intend on being stuffed away and forgotten. I don't know where it is I'm supposed to grow, but I hope I can plant my roots someplace interesting. I just don't know, but on this rise out, I've realized that it's getting kinda lonely. Sure, I have my friends and all, but as that circle gets tighter, it seems harder and harder to let new people into it--more difficult allowing our mold to expand. I feel like that is unfortunate and kinda boring. I love my friends, but I want to experience new people and new situations, and maybe this whole place will eventually become boring to me and I'll have to move on. I don't feel exactly like I'm being handed my hat, but I feel like I could be. I want to be ready to walk out the door. I want to put my face forward and not have to dwell. I don't want to become stagnant and boring like the Matt Pillion's of the world. I want to walk in the footsteps on the John Lynch's, and blaze a trail that hasn't necessarily been sought before. Maybe that's what this year will be for me.</p>
<p>"All By Myself" NOT because of Celine Dion, but because it's just me now, in my room, in my space. I moved it all myself. Also, not "All By Myself", because I've never felt so included and loved before. It's like a paradox, you know? I am like the introvert w/ all the friends, it's wild, really.</p>
<p>I think this entry started off as something somewhat interesting, but now it has evolved into ucky dribble. Apologies on the lack of a timely update. I won't have Internet here in Highland until the 19th. Tomorrow, I will make an effort on the wireless internet to at least update the page and empty my Inbox. I will also search for content for the Buffy page and get that going. Expect like a general synopsis of the series and it's representation for myself. Also, like a list of my most favorite episodes.</p>
<p>Anyways, off I go to bed. My room is probably 90% assembled, and it's very cool and spacious. Come and see. I'm here, give me a call. Love you all, thanks for reading.
