The Flaming Lips</p>
<p>I had the hardest time titling last week. I just don't know why! Obviously, it should be simple. The biggest thing about last week was Gen's 21st birthday (and party). Certainly I could think of a title along these lines. Maybe "Oreo Cheesecake" or "Giant Cookie." Yah, that would work. Anyways, I've settled on something from Yoshimi just because, as a rule, you can't go wrong w/ the Lips. The Lips would never do you wrong.</p>
<p>So, PARTY! Party over :-( Have you heard? Kicked Toga Luau's ASS! Sigh, Toga Luau was nice, but this had keg stands, funnels, cops, and random hookups. It's everything I dreamed it would be! Well, things started off SLOW. I told most people it started at 9. I expected SOMEONE at nine, anyone, but no one showed until about 11. Kyle was the first to show, and you should have seen it. Marilia, Missy, me and Gen surrounded him, just transfixed on an ACTUAL party guest. Well, after Kyle, it was super-sexy-Sorority Girl Laura, and it snowballed from there. I, of course, remained in a buzz/drunk state throughout.</p>
<p>So, KEG STAND! Yah, those were fun, I lifted a few people up. Don't recall lifting up Gen specifically, but I'm sure I did, she loves keg stands. She funnelled VERY well. Like a pro. She downed that stuff so fast, impressed her former roommates (who left early after Aiman romped in w/ an "I HEART Lesbians" t-shirt. Thanks Aiman, suttle). Probably wasn't his fault...anyways, there were cops. Apparantly the noise level was alittle much for mystery neighbors living behind us. A cop apparantly came strolling through the woods w/ a flashlight, asking us to be just a little more quiet. Marilia handled the situation very well. I was upstairs w/ all the other party-goers, playing Mario Kart. Jeremy hid in Marilia's closet. That Fellows coward.</p>
<p>So, RANDOM HOOK-UPS! Well, let's just say ONE freshman from West GA and ONE of Aiman's roommates hooked up in Marilia and Milo's bathroom. Yah, fun times, which is why I locked my door. It's a bathroom though, it's not like seman stains ceremic tile :-O Yah, at some point in the evening, I had to kick Scott and Aiman out of Milo's room. Sure, they weren't FUCKING, they were arguing about Arab/Israeli relations, but still! They had no business locking themselves in Milo's room, that's very disrespectful. I know when I argue w/ my boyfriend about Arab/Israeli conflict, I take that into the privacy of my home, where it belongs. No, seriously...</p>
<p>My favorite Party Favors: Mary-Kate, always a sexy treat. She should have a twin, like the Mary-Kate of the Olsen twins. Then it would be double the Mary-Kate, double the fun! Also, super-sexy Sorority Girl Laura. I remember wanting to talk to her about interesting ex-b/f things. I'm sorry Laura...just feelin' so STRETCHED. Then there was April, a fun girl indeed. Again, it annoys me that she has this name. I say April, and I think of dry but deep April Smith, trapped forever in Marietta. I don't think of the gay man's low calorie treat April Conway...but I'm beginning to. Yey for change. Jeremy was fun, and horny! Fun times...(he'll probably resent that, hehe) Cat and co. were great, the freshman are very cool. I love being drunk around new people. Kyle and John returned later in the evening and I remember talking about the office. Yah, I tried to remove myself from THAT subject. Anyways, I've found a balloon w/ all this Japanese writing on it, and I'm going to figure it out, I'm going to find its meaning. Oh, Vicki...why don't you enjoy random drunken parties...why do they upset you so! :-(</p>
<p>The point of the evening, Genevieve's happiness, was accomplished. Seldom do drunk Nick and drunk Gen meet, but hopefully, now that Gen is legal, we will meet more often. Drunk Gen is just adorable. Sober birthday Gen is a hoot and a half as well. Today, Missy and I chilled at Brio's Tuscan Grille while her mother and father served a fabulous lunch (and birthday desert!) I wish my parents cared that much about me...at least my mother does, she's wonderful. Gen's an amazing girl. Never have I met anyone so kind-hearted and strong. I'm priviledged to have her as my friend. Having the opportunity to make her happy on her birthday is the best thing that's happened to me all month.</p>

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, September 16th...Happy Anniversary Mom</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Yey, serious entry! I know, not many of these, so here goes.</p>
<p>Today marks my mother's third year anniversary for being sober. Yes, to those who don't know (and apparently there are many of you) my mother struggled with a narcotics addiction for eleven years. It was on this day, three years ago, that my mother took one enormous last shot of morphine before she was admitted into Ridgeview (an excellent rehab center). She tells me that the last shot she took would have killed any normal person. My mother was strong, but stupid. Very stupid.</p>
<p>I remember the first night we went to visit her. She had been out of the house for a few days, but we went in one afternoon, and on the side of one of the buildings, the four of us sat at a picnic table under some trees and talked to her. My mother and father were going to separate that week. They were going to get a divorce. My mother told him the night before he was going to start moving his stuff that she had been taking drugs for the past eleven years. My father loved her, and decided to support her through the ordeal. There was alot of tension between them, I remember. But as light-hearted as you would expect me to be, I just asked my mother for a dollar so I could get some peanut butter M&Ms from the vending machine. I never liked those visits.</p>
<p>I remember the first time my mother came home to visit. It was so nice seeing her in the house again, it felt right. She had been gone for way too long. We would see her though, every week. Family counseling was every Tuesday at 8pm (I know, during the fifth season of Buffy, my most FAVORITE SEASON actually...somehow I managed). Jen hated those sessions. I didn't like it so much, but they were worth something, and I met alot of people. Alot of normal, fucked up people like my mother. They had problems. They couldn't help themselves.</p>
<p>When you enter the Twelve Step program, the first step is to give up your power to a higher power. Whether this be a Christian God, Muslim, Jewish, whatever, it's an important step. You realize you are powerless in fighting addiction and you look to your God for guidance. My mother did this and my mother has remained sober for the last three years. I have alot of respect for her. My father, while the two of them were embroiled in a nasty divorce last year, told her that he thought she would go to Ohio to relapse and die. My mother didn't forget that. I bet she's thinking about that today, holding her 3rd one-year chip. I wrote my mother today and told her she was strong. I love my mother, and I am proud of her.</p>
<p>So yah, that's it. Pretty damn deserving of an entry, I hope you didn't fall asleep. Ok, you can sleep now, goodnight.

<div class="post">
<p>I wish I didn't have to do homework. No matter its designation, sometimes I wonder if <i>such a thing never existed</i>, would it still have any significance.</p>
<p>Lately, I've heard of people being bitches. I felt that somewhat today, some people just being asses. On the plus side, I've felt the positive energy flow from certain special individuals that tend to force me to look on the bright side of things. April (now saccharine/cancer-death free!) is so sweet to me, and Rainey and Jeff too, they are so nice and welcoming. I'm all shelled up in my castle doing boring ol' Spanish, and they can't help but make me feel that if I didn't have such pressing academic needs, I'd at least have a place to munch on brownies and watch disturbing video game footage. Thanks guys. (side note to bitches...get over your judgmental, gloomy, pretentious selves. Nobody likes a stick in the mud)</p>
<p>So, yah, Spanish...</p>

<p>Most inteligent thing I've heard all week...besides McAlexander's analysis of Comp. Lit. students. That man's a genius.</p>
<p>Nothing has materialized regarding tonight! I want to go to a gay party :'( Jeremy and I were united in our distaste that a gay party opportunity had NOT presented itself this weekend. Why do I always have to throw the parties? Daniel Tindol should have a party. Last year, on this very weekend, he rocked my world with the very first apartment party I had ever been to. Oh, how sweet it was. Genevieve made out w/ so many guys! It's amazing how things change...</p>
<p>So, yah, tonight I think I'll just tool around w/ Matt, and that's hoping that he thinks I'm cool enough to hang out with, which isn't likely. There's so many other cool things a cat like him could be doing. Who'd want to hang out at my dingy ICE CREAM stocked house anyways? And there's always the Buffy...we're the most boring couple, aren't we? Maybe we'll switch it up w/ some badminton :-D</p>
