<p>In the morning<br>
There would be ashes<br>
a waste, a loss<br>
and death<br>
In the morning there would be tears.</p>

<p>I got into ENGL4800!! For all those idiots out there, that's Advanced Creative Writing. I guess I'm not an idiot afterall. I was kinda half-expecting the professor to e-mail me saying my poetry was too personal to be good. I can see that, and I want to move away from such things, it's just that I feel so inspired by emotion, ESPECIALLY negative emotion. It's like venting. I want to write more stuff that would have an impact on more than just myself. Modernism gets me more than I had originally thought, so maybe if I went through some Wallace Stevens and some William Carlos Williams I could be all literary. Wouldn't that be cool. I think it's the one thing I can stand to do because I do it anyways.</p>
<p>I think I'll go to Cingular now and see if they can fix my poor cell phone. If they can't, expect me begging some people for phone numbers. Yah...fun times...ANYWAYS, it's always those phone numbers that you never call but never want to delete that are the ones that you cherish the most. I mean, what if that number calls you? Then you can see the caller ID and be all like, "Wow, that's the person I never call...interesting!" Let's hear it for rarely called phone numbers, folks. Alright.</p>
<p><u>Random Fact of the Day</u>: My mother sang me "Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong" when I was inside her :-)

<p>Well, I suppose it's time to spill my Fall Break plans. Yes, I will be leaving the state, at long last. No more home sitting this time around (though last year I did Boo-Butante for a second year in a row). I will be going to Maryland with Matt, Barry, and April. We'll be seeing John. It will be a pleasurable treat :-) You all should let me know what YOU'RE doing. Missy's going to the Florida game. She's bugged me about going with her for two years, she's finally going to realize her dream. I'm happy for her. Gen's going to Alpharetta. Not sure what other folks are doing. I hope to be seeing the sights.</p>
<p>My cell phone is BROKE. Yah, I'm pissed. I'm probably going to ask you for your phone number...you know, if I ever call you or would ever want to call you. You should probably just send me your number to get it over with, you know...so I don't have to be ackward and ask you. That would be nice of you. Maybe my shit-phone will wake up long enough so I can get your number out...but that's doubtful :-/</p>
<p>I'm going out on Wednesday night as one last hurrah before Fall Break. Come see me, I love to dance, and I also love conversation hearts. Wow, had a craving today in Communication Law. Sigh...and I can't even have them yet, I have to wait like 4 months. Sucky.</p>
<p><u>Random Fact of the Day</u>: I hate all condiments.

<div class="post">
<p>in medias res<br>
You'll find I won't cooperate.<br>
You have hands to hold me down<br>
But I have puzzle pieces<br>
Intricacies to throw at you<br>
<br>
You think our show has ended<br>
But I have made a pizza<br>
The cheese is melting on your shoe<br>
I should probably tell him that<br>
If he'd give me half a second<br>
<br>
Don't look at it like that!<br>
The paint will peel--No!<br>
Stop, don't touch that<br>
...Ok, well, alright.<br>
I hope you feel better<br>
<br>
Oh Absalom!<br>
I think they get the point.

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, October 31st...HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>April did it, so I'll bore you with the details.</p>
<p>Uber toast<br>
The best hamburgers in the world!<br>
African Sea</p>
<p>Damn, I think that's it. Hmmm...anyways, I'm more hungry now, I think I'll look for some milk or bread. See you LATER.</p>
<p>BTW, I'm in Maryland :-)
