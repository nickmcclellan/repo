<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, August 25th...4:13am</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Alright, well, since I was so livid at this time yesterday, I finished my week with a description of the events of Friday night. Since I missed the events of Saturday, I will do them here SINCE it is officially Sunday anyways.</p>
<p>Ok, can I please comment on how much the D. J. Sammy song &quot;Here in Heaven&quot; has captivated me and truly taken me away to this place where I'm holding Alex close and being completely content and alright? Ok, so I DIDN'T dance with him tonight, but I was so close, the stars almost aligned for me. He was doing kinda the same thing he did Friday, where he danced facing me but didn't really give me a look or anything...he may have been waiting for me to initiate something. I just don't know, and that's the fun part. I don't know if he is into me and I don't know if he hates me and wants me to go away. And, let me just get this straight now, I HAVE A CRUSH ON ALEX, it's not something that I can't control. It's just, you know, if I could spend a good hour dancing in his arms, I would just be as happy as ever. I would love to go home resting on his shoulder, that would be amazing...so good. I'm not going to pursue this any further then a good night at Boneshakers. I am interested in talking to him outside of a clubbing experience to see if he really is this guy that's worth any time. He could just be a cute face, we all know where cute faces can put us.</p>
<p>Well, Aiman didn't call me today, which didn't bother me too much. I was busy with alot of stuff. I woke up at noon and went hiking with Gen. Afterwards, I showered, ate some lunch, and took a small nap. Missy called and we talked about plans for the night. I then ventured to Reed to get her CD's and give John the 5 dollars I owed him. After returning, I visited Sarah and Erica and talked about my ROOMMATE'S ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR some more. This was entertaining. Ran into Missy while she was doing laundry, ended up hanging out with her until we went out. We got downtown, walked around, confused where our place would be. We bumped into Allyson, surprisingly enough. We had a good talk, parted, and decided to spend our night at the drag show at Boneshakers. This was pretty cool, I ran into Ilya and caught up with him. He's doing really well, I suppose. I'm going to try to have more patience with him this year and maybe keep him as a good friend into the summer. Well, after the show, we all ended up on the dance floor. I danced with Missy (WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY STUNNING TONIGHT, AS ALWAYS) and got to a good dancing point with Alex, but that fizzled JUST BEFORE &quot;We're in Heaven&quot; came on...my heart was broken, but I was so happy to be dancing with my best friend to my most favorite techno song right now. After missing my shot at Alex for the night, I went out on the patio to talk with Missy, and eventually Ilya came over, and we took him to a friend's apartment to deal with some issues with his new roommate. Ilya was staying with this guy, who I thought had really intense eyes, he was hot. He was gay too...hehehe.</p>
<p>I had a very nice night. It was a great weekend, and I'm really happy that I ventured out and did something. I'm hopeful that the rest of my Sunday might include a call from Aiman, but I don't know. We'll see. If not, I might call him to see if he's ok, because I am interested in spending some time with him. I really want to talk to John about it first though, cause I'm not sure what kind of guy Aiman is. Well, at 5 I will be going to Mass. Some Spanish homework. Gotta start another week, a whole new horizon of opportunities. I hope you all have a blessed week. Much love, friends.

<div class="post">
<p>Doh, I just am not certain my trip to the gym today was very successful. Well, REALLY, it was, but I didn't feel as &quot;hurt&quot; as I felt last week. I think that I've become more accustomed to the workout, thus, I have to go harder in order to make more headway. I will try to increase the weight maybe on Wednesday. I did look in the mirror today, and I noticed that I have had some minimal results. Let's just say, when Missy said I had to do the pec deck...that is not as necessary anymore.</p>
<p>Well, up for tonight, I've got the Lambda meeting. I am interested in seeing Alex and Aiman...that will be very cool. I am pretty sure it will be just as uneventful as last week, but who knows. I intend on going out with all the people after the meeting as well, maybe I will be able to socialize some more and make more friends. I must say, the euphoria of the weekend is wearing down. I could use something else to make me happy, you know...a date or something. It's one of those things that I set out to do this year. I want to date more. I dated NULL last year, NADA. I'm going to make the most of my time and I'm going to be happy.</p>
<p>Mondays...not much to say, much love people, talk to you soon.

<h2 class="date-header">Tuesday, August 27th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Not sure why, but today was a mildly depressing day. It wasn't that I was really depressed, it was just I had isolated myself in the afternoon for understandable reasons. Like last year, I just preferred to stay in instead of going out after I had done everything for the whole day. I tried to nap, but that was fruitless, but I had a very nice dinner with Vicki. It turns out we both like to eat slow together.</p>
<p>Had a great run this morning. I am finding that though I added a half a mile to my 3 mile runs, it hasn't slowed me down. I think that in a month, I will be handling 5 miles every other day with ease.</p>
<p>Oh, darn, nothing interesting happened today! Just class...working out...lunch and dinner...no guys, NO GUYS! That may, no WILL change though. I'm going to go to Boneshakers Friday, maybe Saturday...and hopefully tomorrow for no cover night. Well...not much left to say today. Cya tomorrow.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, August 28th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Oh, how odd...why is it on Wednesdays I always over exert myself on my workouts? I think it's the height of me week depression. I'm so depressed that I'm NOT having fun that I feel that if I work out more I will have more fun during the weekend because I will be in better shape...does that make any sense? Well, the workout was not as agressive as last week, but I must say it was aggressive in different ways. Last week, I ran 4 miles, did weights, did 400 crunches, and stretched...this week I ran 4 and a half mile, did 200 crunches, and only stretched 3 times...like 3 times is not enough, right?</p>
<p>I saw this guy Nathan there I THINK...I didn't say hi because I was running a whole lot and I'm not very social when I'm running. The cool thing is is that I found out that John is going to go out with him! I think that's so awesome, cause John is such a cool guy, and Nathan seems like he can make John very happy.</p>
<p>Well, I'm going to go to no cover night with Ilya, and hopefully I will have a good time. I want to dance my ass off until 2 am and maybe I'll run into my crush, and hopefully I can put this whole thing behind me, you know, find something horribly wrong with him and then decided I don't like him...or make out with him and just feel like I've had enough...I don't know about you, but I'd MUCH RATHER make out and dance some before I get over him...hehehe...I'll have to listen to the &quot;Crush&quot; song one more time...grrr....night friends.
</div>
<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, August 31st</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Well, it's actually Sunday, Sept. 1st, but let's not be technical. Well, my week has been very interesting. Despite a boring Thursday (and Wednesday night, sadly), it ended pretty good. I had my date with Aiman yesterday night, and I really had a nice time. I really think he's genuinely stricken with me, for some odd reason, so it's refreshing to see someone so cool taking an interest...and being such a gentleman too. I'm a nice guy, and it's so neat to meet someone that's not duplicitous and transparent...I really think he has layers. I want to get into things with him more, see where they go.</p>
<p>Oh, just had an anxiety attack over this stupid online thing. Ok, so I've gotten alittle honest the last few weeks, I dunno, because I'm a crazy idiot, I don't know, but let me explain without uncovering what I FEAR might happen. Ok, when I say I have a crush on someone (and this is something I wanted to explore earlier because I got into a little crisis with it on Friday), it doesn't really mean anything. I have crushes all the time. Over the summer, I had a crush on the cart attendant at Target. He was really cute, but ultimately unreachable, and I deal with that, the crush faded and now it's nothing...like it always was. Well, of course, my crush for Alex, which is still really prominent, I must say (because he's really cute, and I really do enjoy dancing with him) it has faded alittle. I would love to get to know him more, and that's really the whole appeal of the whole thing. Someone I could get to know...it's kinda a way of dealing with it. Well, just because I have a crush on him doesn't mean it's something that should be passed around and whispered about. I have alot of crushes. There are alot of guys that I would love to pursue things with but WON'T. I just want to say this here, because I think it's a compliment more so then an invitation to a relationship. I think he's hot, I think he's attractive, and his presence is just electric, if he was to find out this, and I was him, I would take comfort in the fact that I have that effect on someone.</p>
<p>Well, that's my rant. I just realized that I haven't published what I wrote on Monday yet, so I don't see why I'd be upset about it. I was afraid that someone that has access to my site would have access to Alex and would be like, &quot;OMG!, that guy likes you!&quot; That would be incredibly childish (and, interestingly enough, exactly what I would want to happen). Well, I just don't want some 3rd grade thing to go on, and I'm not going to worry about it. I told John I had a crush on him, and about all of my str8 friends, and I don't see why he wouldn't already know. Baring what happened on Friday of course...which I'll get into momentarily. In closing, whatever &quot;crush&quot; I have, it holds no flame to who I'm currently dating now, Aiman, who actually ASKED me out, and is taking an active interest in me. It's too bad things couldn't develop with these other guys before Aiman, or else, things could be different.</p>
<p>Well, Friday, Aiman took me out to a nice (and EXPENSIVE) Italian restaurant. We had nice conversation, I tried to be interesting and nice, while also trying to get to know him. I felt that it was a nice evening dinner, and afterwards, we went to Blue Sky and say some people he knew. We then went to Boneshakers and saw the drag show. He was so sweet to me! Even when we were dancing, he didn't push the &quot;bad&quot; dancing, because I guess that's not what you do when you date. I was alittle worried that I would be expected to do certain things since he took me out, but he didn't make me feel this way at all. Even when I dropped him off at his apartment, he kissed me on the cheek, and I didn't feel bad about not kissing him more...though I kinda wanted to, despite alot of shyness. Well, we went to The Grill too, and he bought me a rose! It was the first time any guy bought me a rose, and I was really touched. I was really treated so amazing by him, and it really made me want to do something cool for him. I thought I could make him a really cheesy CD, but I'm going to think about it more. I kinda want to hang out at his apartment and watch a movie next weekend, maybe share with him a movie I really enjoy. I foresee that I can really get into Aiman, and just really become attached. I am really looking forward to what will come from this... The coolest part of the date might have been when I was driving him home, I had my Beautifulgarbage cd on random, and &quot;Drive You Home&quot; came on first, and that was so fitting for the whole thing between me and him. I hope he listened to it, because I'm making it his song, I think...it is just fate, you know?</p>
<p>Well, tomorrow (or today now) I'm going home until Monday. I'm really looking forward to wearing MY GLASSES again and also seeing Joey and Lily. The parents and sister too, and also to get a decent meal. Hmmm...well, not much left to say. I hope you like my title for the journal, it's from a well-written No Doubt song called &quot;Home Now.&quot; Listen to it, it is very cool.
