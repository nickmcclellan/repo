<div class="post">
<p>Sadly, another semester at UGA has come to an end. My final weekend is up, and I look forward to returning home. This week, I'll make some effort to bring this whole ordeal to some sort of meaningful end...mostly because I was reading some of my later journal entries from the summer, and I wrote them very well! I was quasi-impressed...I was personal, but I wasn't offending or upsetting anyone. Where did I lose that?</p>
<p>I would like to note that this week's title is some random thing I wrote...a few months ago, I just got in my head random poetic verse, and I knew it served some purpose, but it really never fit in with a poem or anything...but they had something about them that just made me want to keep them. The above is one of them. Just like at the beginning of the semester, I made this huge production out of my big update. I made a huge deal of writing my first journal, &quot;Return to UGA&quot;...and I tried to write in it every day so that I could record such a &quot;crucial&quot; time. This semester, I've written in it alot...mostly because I believe I have alot to share. Last year, things happened, but they really weren't that interesting. I like to write about interesting things, and hopefully you like to read about them.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, this semester my journal has taken on a very disgusting form. For the first time, I've had to be careful about what I wrote. Any normal person would be like, &quot;Well, DUH!&quot;, but I always believed it was a good thing to be honest about how you felt...and it was also good not to be ashamed of these feelings. However, those confessions have fueled alot of the bad things that have happened this semester, and I realize that, and have realized that, and am going to change that.</p>
<p>Vicki's got a journal now. I'm so excited that finally one of my close friends has an internet journal. I now have something with which to model my journal after. I don't read other people's journal that often...it just seems that everyone reads mine...so now I can read hers and have some model to follow. So far, she's said she's not going to be personal. I think I should do that too, but I'm leaning toward cautiously personal...because I was just reading my journal entry from the week of July 7th...and that was so very personal, and it came out so well! Why should I be ashamed of that? Nobody read it and was offended or hurt or thought differently of me, it was a very endearing expression of how I felt at the time, and I like that people got to see that. As I suggested earlier, my journal has no INTENTION. I am not seeking to do anything more then to provide an outlet for those that want to understand me to do so. It's too bad I didn't accomplish that this semester, but I will continue to try.</p>
<p>Well, on the plate today, I have a paper to write, which I'm finding very hard to put my energies toward...I'm very distracted today. I also plan on heading downtown to get some Christmas presents at Junkman's...I don't have anyone to go with, but maybe an afternoon by myself isn't so bad. Afterwards, I might have dinner with anyone who wants to have dinner with me...and I will study my little butt off for my Spanish final tomorrow. After this...I really don't have anything besides class on Monday. My finals are going to be pretty easy, I just need to give them a good two hours of studying, and I'll do fine.</p>
<p>So much left to do here, and so little time left. I take comfort in the fact that although my time in Marietta will be stressful and maddening, I have something good to come home to.

<div class="post">
<p>My Monday was real good...very good...yes, damn good...um, yah, I won't go into details because, you know, it gets obnoxious sometimes...you know, you don't really care, yah, that I feel this damn good...nah, you just want to know why...so ask my, uh huh, I'll tell you.</p>
<p>Well, my last day of classes this semester was bittersweet. My Spanish final was longer then I thought, but thanksfully, studying helped so much. I think I secured a B, that was pretty certain...and if a miracle occurs, and I get an A...I would feel so very happy, I think I'd burst...but, I digress. My English class was cut short, so we just dropped or papers off and I headed to the Lambda office. I planned on surprising Daniel with a charming banana that he would hopefully enjoy, but he wasn't there...fuck. I am getting him something that I know he said he liked for Christmas since he was really sweet to me for my birthday (and not to mention the horrible drunkenness...). Well...so without the charming antics of Daniel, the office was pretty quiet and boring. I ventured to Journalism...my last class with Padmini, it seems. It was short, so I made it back to my room for a good while before my lunch with Vicki, which was very nice. I feel like I can endure a hiatus away from her...I will miss her.</p>
<p>Missy called me about lunch, and I had a dessert with her, and got some hardcore Missy time in...who knows what I'm going to do a whole month without her...she's such a friend. It's so crutial to have these friends...I don't know what I'd do without them...Missy is just amazing. Well, I left her and made it to the Lambda office...which was cool. I'll miss that as well...but I know it will be there next semester...that's good. Well, back to Missy, we ended up talking last night forever about a whole bunch of stuff...around 3:30AM, I started getting really tired, so we had to quit. It's hard to quit talking though when you've got so much to say.</p>
<p>Well, last night Bryant came over and watched <em>The Big Sleep</em> and <em>Amelie</em> with me...this was alot of fun, we've spent some time together last night and the night before, and it's really nice, I am really into getting to know him, and it's a real bummer that I have to go home for a month. Well, hopefully I can call him now and then, and we'll see eachother in January...who knows.</p>
<p>Tonight I might give kareoke another try...depending on if Sonya still wants to go. I probably won't stay as long as last time. I haven't started studying for finals...but I've got it easier then others, so I guess it's really not that necessary. I might take a nap this afternoon...I feel like I should make the most of my reading day...ah...sounds like a plan...</p>
<p>One thing before I go...I had 96 hits on my journal last week...and that's just insane! People are way too interested in me...and I have 36 hits on this page so far...and I only updated it on Sunday...very very odd...I guess I enjoy the attention though.

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, December 11th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I'm still feeling...well, pretty good. Things are going very well, and I can't help but feel really good...my finals aren't that bad...I'm really enjoying the handful of time I have left...and I'm so over this semester. It's invigorating.</p>
<p>Today, I had some time in the Lambda office, feeling very good that I was providing for the UGA community a good resource...you know, coffee and marshmallows and all. Bryant did the sweetest thing...and it was just a big pick-me-up...Chuck brought some Chick-fil-a into the office...and I hadn't eaten, and I was considering going down to the Bulldawg Cafe and getting me some, but then Bryant IMed me and asked if I wanted a Chicken Sandwich...and then he brought me one! Wow, I was so impressed...he had no idea that that's what I wanted, but he brought it to me anyways...and he spent the entire time at the office with me, and I was just really glad I got to spend even more time with him. We went to dinner and I got to know Whit some more, and I think he's a really cool guy. Drunkenness is misleading...</p>
<p>Missy and Sonya were also excellent hostesses for Bryant when we went over to Sonya's place...I like that they are so adorable, who couldn't love them!</p>
<p>The day after tomorrow, I'm going back to miserable Marietta...and I don't care. I'm feeling so very good right now...it's like I'm not leaving. I don't want to get burned out on this feeling, and I'm being cautious...time away is good, you need balance. I'm just taking this one day at a time, and that's really cool.</p>
<p>On less good-feeling news, talking to Jeremy about this DAMN internet journal continued to make me feel Uber-creepy about even having this anymore...I'm going to change! I'm going to change! I still like writing this, and I want to continue. It's not required reading to know me...I'm not going to put anything here that I wouldn't tell anyone else normally. I am going to impart things that particularly made me feel good and anything that I'm thinking about at the time. We'll see, right? Well, I have to sleep...exam tomorrow...goodnight all.

<h2 class="date-header">Friday, December 13th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Wow, Friday the 13th. This day is going to be miserable and amazing, I just know it. Sure, I'm supposed to be studying for my Geography final now, and I'm going to do that. I will do just fine...I assure you. It's just...damnit, that's all I have to say. Why the hell does this have to end? I got a call from Target at home yesterday, they wanted me to work TONIGHT. I mean, I can't...but the idea that I COULD be working tonight scares me. That's how close it is. I have just had the most amazing time here, and I know that I HAVE to work this Christmas, and I'm going to do it, but it's just, wow. I never thought my semester was going to be this good.</p>
<p>One thing that just made me feel really good Wednesday night I would like to share. I was talking to Bryant before I went to bed, and we had a really nice conversation about all sorts of stuff. I told him just things, and he said something to me that just made me feel really good...he said, &quot;You're different.&quot; I was like, wow, I mean, yah, I think I'm different, but it's nice to know that he sees it. It's not like I go out and scream, &quot;You know, I'M DIFFERENT&quot;, but it's there, and he told me, and I was just really content about that. We're going to go bowling tonight, so that's the last thing I've got here. Then I'm going to drive back. I really like Bryant, and I am really going to enjoy talking to him over the break. It's an opportunity to get to know eachother more. When we come back in the Spring, we'll see what happens.</p>
<p>Other then that, I've felt very close to Missy, Gen, and Sonya, like I have for the last couple weeks. They are really what helped me get over alot of shit, and they are so adorable. They also are big me-and-Bryant fans...so it's really cute all that they have to say about that. Next semester, I am looking forward to seeing more of Sonya, becoming closer friends, like Gen and Missy and I are. Next semester I would also like to get more involved with my Journalism major, doing things besides Lambda, but still doing a good bit in the Rainbow Squad and the office. Making Spring Semester an opportunity moreso then a disappointment is also on my mind. I'm optimistic about it like I was last semester, but I'm not going to make the same miserable mistakes. I have a much broader base of friends, so I have so much to do and be excited about. I'm going to be dying to come back...</p>
<p>Well, I am not sure when I will write again. Probably after I work on Saturday, which will be from 1 until 9pm. That's not too bad, midnight would have been rough. I anticipate that I will be working overnight later on next week...THAT will be something. Those will be interesting journals...I always go a bit insane when I work overnight, so you have to check those out. My spring update will be up as soon as I get back in January. That will be fun, and with all my extra time at home, I will be able to make it look ubercool (excuse my usage of the word &quot;uber&quot; lately...on Buffy, there is a new villian, the UberVampire! Consequently, I have applied &quot;uber&quot; to most of my words...for example, Bryant is ubercute :-) Well, that's all for me now...until next time...

<h2 class="date-header">Saturday, December 14th...3:37AM</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I'm right here...in my room now. I'm so very far from Athens. I drove out sometime after one, after the most amazing seven minutes of my semester. I ventured aimlessly looking for a gas station...some substance that will propel me from my friends. I noted that the sky was so black and the whole world seemed dead. This was the time. I was meant to leave tonight.</p>
<p>Tonight was just...amazing. I don't think I have ever been this happy before...and I'm not talking about corny &quot;forever&quot; happy, this isn't that good yet, but I'm talking about &quot;all around&quot; happy. I have never in my life had the friends that I have now that would do the things my friends do for me. Before I went on my date with Bryant tonight, Missy sat around with me and I helped her ponder what she would like to eat for dinner...I'm sure she settled on Wheat Thins, that adorable girl... She sat patiently in my room while I loaded my life in Athens into my precious shit-mobile. Then she left, and I will see her again, but Missy is gone, for a good while.</p>
<p>Despite the gravity of all that happened tonight, I feel incredibly grounded. Yah, I'm psyched, and just a little bit amazed, but I'm not spinning out of control. I'm walking slowly toward what I hope is something really special. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but I have tonight. I have, and will always have tonight. Tomorrow, the world could flip upside down, and I won't care. I got to see a glimmer of something...something I have never felt before. Something I wish I could feel more of.</p>
<p>I'm ok. This has all happened, but I remain the same. I just have something possibly really amazing to return to, but no pressure. I am content and cautious. I don't expect anything.</p>
<p>I wanted to write something after tonight, and this is it. I remain cautiously personal, so if you feel like you should hear more, you know who to call. Today, I have to work. I'm going to walk into that place, make my money, and leave. My time here has only just begun, but just like this semester flew by, so shall this. This misery and lonliness will be replaced by the overwhelming potential of a new year...a year, that for several reasons, I anticipate will be my best ever. Next year, I plan on traveling abroad. This is something that I need to do, I have to do. Next year I'm going to be just a bit wiser then this year.</p>
<p>I'm too tired to be provoking, so I'm just going to go to bed. I miss you Athens, but I will be back. We'll have our chance...when I get back.
