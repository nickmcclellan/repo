<div class="post">
<p>Sitting here in the Lambda office listening to my mp3's...no one has visited me yet...I shed a tear. Oh well, I am sure I will enjoy some time alone in a haven for homosexuals...hehehe. Well...what happened since Saturday. Well, I talked to my parents...and I won't get into that...I don't like to discuss stuff like that. I saw Vicki today at lunch, it was very cool to talk to her. I discussed the possibility of her coming to a Lambda meeting. We didn't talk about anyone else though, not one other person besides each other.</p>
<p>Tuesday I'm going to have my third date with Aiman. Seems like interests are still high, and I must admit I'm really falling for him...maybe not as much as I would like to, but enough to be really into having him as a b/f. That would be all official and really cool. I probably couldn't go out very much, but who cares, I'd have a b/f to share all my time with. That would be cool, wouldn't it? I certainly think so! Well, anyways, we're going to watch <i>Amelie</i> at his apartment. I know, I thought this was too forward and stuff, but actually, on Friday we ended up at his apartment, and it was fairly innocent. I don't think he's very forward with that affectionate stuff, which is cool, it gives me a better idea of how to proceed. Of course, I am alittle more into him leading the way, because I'm such a chicken shit when it comes to kissing and stuff. Even though I know he would so not mind, I still get butterflies that fly from my mouth and hold me down. Scary huh...</p>
<p>Saturday night, I went out with Missy and we had some Bacardi, which was very disgusting! AND I didn't even get a buzz! Maybe alittle. I was talking to alot of people on the internet, and I think all my alcoholic courage went to that in some strange way. I don't like to drink that much, but Missy brought (STOLE) some alcohol from home, so it was cool to share that experience with her...it's reminiscent of freshman year. We would hang out in my room and she would bring some big bottle of alcohol that she somehow got a hold of, and she would drink drink drink, and I would just see this change in her, it was so funny, and I would take her downtown, and we would find something entertaining to do, and I would take her back to Brumby. It wasn't until my birthday that I started to drink...but when I would drink, it would be very very rare. It's too bad that we can't find a place to have fun when we go out though. She knows that Boneshakers is pointless, and I know everything else is pointless to me, so it's very hard to find a place to meet. I want to spend time with her, but at the same time I want to go to Boneshakers with my friends and have a good time myself. I honestly have a better time with Missy though, I feel more comfortable with her. I hope though, that at some point, she can find time to go out with some of her new sorority friends and have a better time. I know that getting liquored up with them and going someplace more str8 would be so much more exciting for her. I welcome that, because I am moving fairly rapidly from being dependent on Missy...and it's time to let old habits die.</p>
<p>John asked me to put together a social event for Lambda. Ok...I am so ambitious! It's funny all this stuff I'm taking on this semester. I'm growing into a mini-Lambda board member. I'm really mellow though, I don't really want to dip my hands into everything, I just want to have more of a say in where this organization is going and I would also like to do my part for the community. This whole thing was sort of brought on by this summer. I worked so much to pay off my car charge card, I realized I had so much potential and could do so much more while at school. Volunteering has never really been an avenue of activity I took much advantage of, but I like what I'm doing for Lambda. It suits me. I want to help people like myself become more comfortable with their sexuality, and I'm a nice guy, I can definitely help some people.</p>
<p>I'm tired...I didn't get much sleep this weekend. Oh, something amazing happened last night! I came out to my roommate! This was so unexpected, but Choe started talking to me about his roommate from Georgia State and how one night he brought a girl back to his room and had sex with her. The whole time that I've been here, I've really had a negative attitude toward Choe and have struggled to find something that I like and respect about him. Well, this weekend, I had just been fed up with being pissy toward him, so I decided to be alittle bit more forward and polite. Well, when he mentioned what his roommate was doing, I mentioned to him how Ilya's roommate Justin would bring guys over and have sex with them while Ilya was in the room. Well, Choe didn't handle the whole GAY thing well, he was a bit confused, so I just said it...&quot;Well...I'm not sure if you know this, but I'm gay.&quot; And Choe was very surprised. I talked to him about it, and my attitude hasn't changed any, I told him he could ask me anything he would like, I didn't mind. I feel that the time I spend with him this year will leave a positive impact on him regarding his views of gay people in society. I'm going to especially try to have a more positive attitude when it comes to Choe and how I describe him to other people. That's a good thing, right!</p>
<p>Ok...well, it's only 4:30, and I think I'm journaled out...don't know how to keep writing when I don't wanna...so I'll just stop. I'll clean out the coffee maker or something, sounds good, huh? Yah, I thought so! Ok...so no one has visited me today yet...but yes, eventually...I know someone might...please, come on people, it's only 2 hours a week...if you visit me the most, I might share my contest prize with you. Ok, tootles individuals...

<h2 class="date-header">Wednesday, September 11th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>One year ago, the most devastating and horrific attack on our nation occurred. The hours following the dreadful images, I formed for myself very strong opinions about what had occurred on this day. Looking back onto these thoughts, I don't have any regrets. I truly feel that we Americans are all responsible for everything that happened on September 11th. Those religious zealots, no matter how crafty and concealed, walked onto our planes, and we let them kill our family and friends. It's no secret that bin Laden was after Americans and would strike at any moment. It's naive of us to think that evil just had our number that day, we all failed. Every one of us. Including me.</p>
<p>I've moved on since that horrible day. Every day, 9/11 departs me more and more. I'm happy with this, I don't want to dwell on that horrible day. I don't think those who perished would want me to either. I don't think 9/11 should have any significance to anyone besides a moment of self-reflection. We all need to pick up and move on with our lives. 9/11 should be a day to honor American resilience and strength. It should not be a day of open wounds.</p>
<p>That's all I want to write about that this year...</p>
<p>Yesterday night, I had my third date with Aiman! It was so much better then the first two. He put his arms around me and we held hands...my heart was beating like crazy just being close to him. It was amazing. I'm so getting into this. It's so cool how meaningless crushes just melt away and I go full forced into Aiman. The next month and hopefully more will be very cool knowing that I'm going to have a guy like Aiman by my side. I really like him alot...</p>
<p>Ok, I'm out, later folks.

<h2 class="date-header">Thursday, September 12th</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>I'm curious, why is it that some people have the most meaningless conversations? I too often hear some girl talking to some other girl about what she heard some other girl say about her...or about how her friend hangs out with her too much...or about how she is upset with her b/f. I don't get it. I am comparing this to a conversation I had with Genevieve just alittle bit before I observed one of these &quot;meaningless&quot; conversations. I told her happy birthday and mentioned that I would be coming by later with a &quot;surprise.&quot; It was a very cool conversation, if but for a minute and a half, where I imparted to her how I wanted her to have a happy birthday. It served a purpose. I had to call her to see if it was ok if Missy and I came over at 8 o'clock with her surprise. I don't feel like talking about who is really getting on your nerves is a meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>Maybe when I'm ranting about is how shallow some people are. They choose to use a cell phone for some of the most meaningless things. I just don't understand.

<h2 class="date-header">Sunday, September 15th...Opps!</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>Yah, what kind of a person am I that I can't even finish my journal on a Saturday. Maybe it was because I didn't come home on Saturday night :-0</p>
<p>Yah, ok, let me first go into the reason my journal is titled &quot;Making Out&quot;. Mostly based on the No Doubt song &quot;Making Out&quot;, but also for other non-kissing connotations. I made out, I made it though. This week was an interest progression into an intimate relationship with Aiman. That's cool, and it's not highlighting the fact that I made out with him a few times, more so highlighting the idea that I made it, and things are ok.</p>
<p>I don't want to go much into what happened this weekend. I have been drained completely because of an ACCIDENT I had this morning. I was driving my car to Ramsey (to run like a good boy) and I was going too fast. If anyone was in Athens this weekend, they know that it started raining on Friday afternoon and just never stopped. Well, I hydroplaned into a curb and really fucked up my front tire. I have to deal with that this week somehow. This fucks up alot of stuff, but I'm so thankful that I have friends and family to help me through this little bump in the road. I could have died or something, but I didn't. I fucked up my wheel, and I'll get it fixed. A week from now, I probably will be so much better.</p>
<p>Going out to dinner with Aiman and some of his friends tonight. That will be an interesting social event, I'm sure. I'm really drained after my horrible accident, so I'm sulking in my room being lazy. Might as well take the opportunity, it has been a while. This week, I plan on setting up a bowling night for the Lambda kids (with Aiman's help), and on Friday, I am going to rent <i>Red</i> and share it with Aiman. I have something special spinning in my head for Saturday...it's a game day, so that will be something. Hope all like my update...it's fairly interesting, I suppose. Ok, wish me luck this week, goodbye friends!
