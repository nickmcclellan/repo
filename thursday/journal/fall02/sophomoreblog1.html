<h2 class="date-header">&quot;What's Past is Prologue...&quot;</h2>
<div class="post">
<p>After what seemed like a dismal, uneventful summer, I was determined to return to UGA a new man. I wanted to experience so much more in my next round of college. I wanted to make new friends, take more risks, and hit the ground running. Though my friendship with Missy and Genevieve got so bogged down and painfully co-dependent in the waning days of my freshman year, I didn't want to lose them as the essential people they truly were. I wanted to build a base of friends beyond them. I wanted to experience so much more than drunken nights on Brumby Hill. I wanted to do things I had never done before.</p>
<p>It was all easier said than done, of course, and though I grew a great deal during my sophomore year, I grew alot in my internet journal as well. I wrote a great deal in my journal up until the end of spring semester. The sudden interest in writing was most likely spurned by my journal's explosion in popularity&#8212;I noticed visitation go from a mere 10 hits a week to over 100 hits a week by the end of the semester. It seemed like I was on a stage before everyone, and I had to perform. Unfortunately, because of this, my fall journal was the most shameful of all my journals. It's the only journal I had to censor at the request of a close friend. Also, due to this, its probably the most difficult to read. Apologies for that.</p>
<p>But if there's one thing to note about my sophomore year, it's that it set me in a direction I still tread today. I met people that changed my life. I built friendships that have lasted to this day, and will last a lifetime. I broke some hearts (maybe even my own), and I fell in love. This was the single best year I had at UGA. </p>
<p><strong>Fresh Meat</strong></p>
<p>When I returned to UGA, I found a very <a href="8-11journal.html" target="_blank">eccentric roommate</a>, a tiny room, and a changing Missy. She rushed in the fall and made it into the <a href="8-18journal.html" target="_blank">Delta Gamma</a> sorority. I feared this meant she'd change and grow away from me. Fortunately, that wasn't the case. Missy and I became the closest of friends during our sophomore year.</p>
<p>My mission to be more social began at the <a href="8-11journal.html" target="_blank">Lambda picnic</a> where I was introduced to the most interesting group of freshman I ever met at the University. Along with John, I got to meet everyone one of the &quot;newbies,&quot; and even made a few friends. They all seemed so nice and new, but there was something different about them. I never realized until I was a sophomore what currency being a freshman was. Everybody wants to know you, everybody wants to be with you. I made it a point not to stick out like some of the hornier seniors (wink wink), and I ended up coupling up pretty early in the game.</p>
<p>After the first <a href="8-18journal.html" target="_blank">movie night</a> of the year, I went with John to Boneshakers to introduce the youngins to their first gay club. It was quite the evening. I had a crush on this guy, and I danced with him that night to DJ Sammy's &quot;Heaven.&quot; I had never had so much fun. I even ended up snagging a date with an old crush. Aiman asked me out that night, and I quickly accepted. Suddenly, not only was I meeting so many new people, I snagged my second boyfriend too.</p>
<p>But the <a href="8-18journal.html" target="_blank">best part</a> of that amazing night was driving with Genevieve to Waffle House to tell her about my evening and running into Missy, who was driving back home. We all had a little pow wow that night over hash browns&#8212;the original three musketeers, as if nothing had changed. It was only the first week, and I was having the time of my life.</p>
<p><strong>The Boyfriend Issue</strong></p>
<p><a href="8-25journal.html" target="_blank">Aiman</a> became the focal point of my first semester&#8212;him, and my other permanent boyfriend John. It seemed like Lambda had truly <a href="9-8journal.html" target="_blank">absorbed me</a> into its core. I was a part of John's Lambda Office team the &quot;Rainbow Squad&quot;, and I scheduled volunteers for the Office. You see, the Office became ground zero from the Lambda &quot;it&quot; crowd that year. They even had to install a &quot;No <a href="10-14journal.html" target="_blank">Drama</a> Zone&quot; sign because talking about people got alittle out of control at times.</p>
<p>I went on <a href="8-25journal.html" target="_blank">alot</a> <a href="9-1journal.html" target="_blank">of</a> <a href="9-8journal.html" target="_blank">dates</a> with Aiman, and I had a really good time with him at first. One thing about that relationship that really had us at a disadvantage was my inexperience. Aiman was so into me, but I wasn't ready to be <em>that</em> into him. Even though I said the B-word first, I didn't know what it meant. I was reckless with Aiman and his feelings, and things started to go badly. I still had alot of fun with him though, he was a perfect gentleman to me. He even made me <a href="9-15journal.html" target="_blank">dinner</a>: what a prince.</p>
<p>When I wasn't screwing around with Aiman, I was getting drunk with Missy. We had alot of very interesting game day weekends that semester. One day, we even walked in on my roommate, Choe, using a <a href="9-1journal.html" target="_blank">vibrator</a> to masturbate himself! Yes, that was a disturbing sight, but what was even more funny was Missy stumbling out of the side door of Mary Lyndon screaming, &quot;Oh my god, I saw everything!&quot; Also, throwing the football with Missy outside of the <a href="9-15journal.html" target="_blank">South Deck</a> while getting drunk on Everclear mixed drinks listening to Tears for Fears's &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; is a memory I will never forget.</p>
<p>That first few weeks, Daniel Tindol threw some wild parties. I remember one particular party that had Genevieve making out with all these <a href="9-15journal.html" target="_blank">random <em>guys</em></a>! That's right, guys, but do you forget? Geneveive didn't come out until Spring 2003. I guess it's a good thing she didn't hook up with any of those guys (but she did get buck naked with one of them!)</p>
<p><strong>Immature Sophomore</strong></p>
<p>As things progressed, I got really reckless with my journal. My parents at home were divorcing, and things all around me started to fracture and fall to pieces. I thought that I'd start to develop intense feelings for Aiman, but as time progressed, I never got them, and I knew I had to do something about that. There were times that I was even annoyed at how he showed his affection. I didn't want to hurt him, but I knew I <a href="11-10journal.html" target="_blank">didn't want to</a> continue to be with him. Tough stuff.</p>
<p>I also developed a crush on someone that I really regret. It's still not worth mentioning, but I did use this journal as some sorted way of dealing with my issues with Aiman and my desire to be with someone else. It was wrong, and it produced some horrendous writing. I mean, no paragraph breaks, are you kidding me? The worst was my stupid &quot;<a href="10-6journal.html" target="_blank">epiphany</a>&quot; and the annoying <a href="10-14journal.html" target="_blank">fall out</a> that resulted. I never stood well under such burdensome attention.</p>
<p>In the midst of such drama, I did meet some very special people. I met <a href="10-14journal.html" target="_blank">Matt</a> Stephens at the Coming Out meeting the week of the Coming Out Ball. I didn't actually get a chance to talk to him until the next week. He was such a nice person, and I christened him &quot;Nice Matt&quot; after he got me a Long Island Ice Tea on my 20th birthday. I even started to notice that he had a <a href="11-24journal.html" target="_blank">crush on me</a>, but sadly, I was waiting for something. In the meantime, though, he became a very close friend.</p>
<p>Missy had also met alot of new people in her sorority, the most important of which was <a href="9-22journal.html" target="_blank">Sonya</a>. Though she was kind of crazy, Sonya was really nice, and I liked her a whole lot. Missy did too, and the three of us got along pretty well. Sonya did end up hooking up with Ilya, a friend of mine at the time. After the &quot;<a href="12-1journal.html" target="_blank">realistic dream</a>,&quot; the two of them were inseperable, which would lead to future contention.</p>
<p>As the semester started to dwindle to a close, alot of things came to a head. I <a href="11-10journal.html" target="_blank">broke up</a> with Aiman. I gave up on my stupid crush. I started to concede on alot of the goals I had set out for at the beginning of the year. My parents divorce started taking its toll on me. It was all very defeating, and at times I felt <a href="11-24journal.html" target="_blank">pessimistic</a>. But, as they sometimes say, sometimes darkest just before dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Love Affair</strong></p>
<p>After a truly <a href="11-24journal.html" target="_blank">unhappy Thanksgiving</a> that resulted in my mother storming out of the house and moving to Ohio, I figured the few weeks of fall semester couldn't be much good. I had resigned myself to what was sure to be a miserable winter break, but something special happened. <a href="12-1journal.html" target="_blank">One Wednesday</a> night, in the middle of a wimpy ice storm, I went to Boneshakers with John with no intention but to dance and forget about my troubles. I ran into Bryant, a guy I had met on my birthday, who I suspected had been flirtatious with me at the time, but stayed back because he knew I was with Aiman. He was really cute, and I had developed a modest crush on him, but didn't know how to pursue it. After I informed him that I was not dating Aiman anymore, things really got interesting, and suddently I was wisked into a most interesting love affair.</p>
<p>After we had established that the attaction was mutual, Bryant and I participated in a <a href="12-8journal.html" target="_blank">week long</a> courtship that was most unusual, and a whole lot of fun. We went out to dinner, watched movies, fumbled over getting the courage to hold eachothers hand&#8212;it was so innocent and fun. I barely knew him, and he was such a gentleman (he even brough me lunch in the Lambda office). On the Friday I had to go back to Marietta to work for the break, we had a most amazing night. We had dinner, bowled, watched a movie, and kissed for the first time. It's a night I will never forget. I was so content that the semester had ended on such a positive note in light of all that had gone awry.</p>
<p>Over the break, we <a href="12-15journal.html" target="_blank">kept in touch</a>, and I endured what seemed like the most <a href="12-15journal.html" target="_blank">despressing</a> <a href="12-22journal.html" target="_blank">three</a> <a href="12-29journal.html" target="_blank">weeks</a> of my life. While I had a pretty neat guy to talk to on occasion, I worked 40 hours a week over night doing price changes for Target. It was dismal, as most nights we'd finish early and would spend the waking hours of the morning stuffing tinsel into swollen ailes in Trim-a-tree. It was like I was going mad! </p>
<p>I was really thankful that Bryant was there during that depressing time. Talking to him in the early morning hours really brought me through that misery. I looked forward to returning to UGA again, hoping to explore this new opportunity and try to salvage what I could of my sophomore year. I expected so much when I returned&#8212;<a href="../spring03/1-5journal.html" target="_blank">January 5th</a>&#8212;but what happened was exactly what I wasn't expecting.</p>
  <!-- End #main -->
  <p><strong>Separation</strong></p>
  <p>I guess after the break, alot of things changed. I came back to Athens and I couldn't wait for everything that was sure to happen. I really enjoyed talking to Bryant over the break, and I wanted to try my hand at seeing to boy more often. That didn't work out like I thought it would, though. From the <a href="../spring03/1-5journal.html" target="_blank">day</a> I arrived, he was noticably cold to me, and after a <a href="../spring03/1-5journal.html" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="../spring03/1-12journal.html" target="_blank">dates</a> with him, I started to think he wasn't interested in me any longer and was too much of a wimp to tell me. Well, <a href="../spring03/1-12journal.html" target="_blank">I was right</a>.</p>
  <p>I asked him, he confirmed my suspicions, and in a very <a href="../spring03/1-12journal.html" target="_blank">cryptic and disgusting entry</a>, I started my <a href="../spring03/1-19journal.html" target="_blank">post-Bryant depression</a> for all journal readers to see. The situation was complicated by what turned out to be a very difficult semester. I took on my first two upper level English classes. One consisted of me reading <a href="../spring03/1-19journal.html" target="_blank">very long 20th century British novels</a> while the other was helmed by my unholy nemisis <a href="../spring03/3-2journal.html" target="_blank">Trivedi</a>.</p>
  <p>Things started to look up for me, though. After I caught a nasty flu, I went to a <a href="../spring03/1-26journal.html" target="_blank">party</a> that Aiman threw. No, no, there wasn't any ex-boyfriend reconnection or anything like that. I can't communicate how over that is. There was, however, a good self-esteem boost for myself when a few cute drunk boys came over to compliment me on my sweater and flirt with me. Before the end of the weekend, I scored a date with this nice guy <a href="../spring03/2-9journal.html" target="_blank">Jeff</a>. Suddenly, spring semester didn't seem like it was going to be depress-fest after all.</p>
  <p><strong>Going Through the Motions</strong></p>
  <p>Spring seemed to march on, and everything looked like it was in its place. I got <a href="../spring03/2-9journal.html" target="_blank">published</a> for the first time, made it into <a href="../spring03/2-9journal.html" target="_blank">Grady college</a>, and things were going  well with Jeff. Something was missing, though. Maybe it was losing the best couple award at the <a href="../spring03/2-9journal.html" target="_blank">Valentine's Dance</a>, but I just felt so dead inside. I didn't really have much motivation to get <a href="../spring03/2-9journal.html" target="_blank">out of bed</a> at times. At least I had enough motivation to write a <a href="../spring03/2-16journal.html" target="_blank">decent poem</a> (though it was a bit too telling).</p>
  <p>Genevieve came out to me, but I kept that little diddy to myself. There was one night when I got drunk and went to Krush Girls with John, Matt, and Missy. I was literally walking down Clayton St. yelling out, &quot;<a href="../spring03/3-30journal.html" target="_blank">Missy gives the best blow jobs, and I would know, because I'm not a homosexual!</a>&quot; That was another night to remember.</p>
  <p>Things hit a wall academically, though. My cryptic &quot;<a href="../spring03/3-2journal.html" target="_blank">The Nothing</a>&quot; entry came after I flopped my take home midterm for Trivedi's class. I had no idea the class would be as demanding as it turned out. Before the end of the semester, the pressure was driving me nuts, and I knew I had to get out of it. I got a <a href="../spring03/4-6journal.html" target="_blank">WF</a>, but I don't regret it. I blame Trivedi, my nemesis. Even though I realize now that I am smart and capable, my failure at the hands of Trivedi left me unsure of whether I had what it took the be an English major.</p>
  <p>There was one fun night with Drag Queens and an <a href="../spring03/3-2journal.html" target="_blank">orgy of making out</a> that ended with Missy and me with boys in our beds and my new friend Marilia on the floor. That was a night to remember, but it was also the end of my short stint with Jeff. After I realized I only saw him as a friend, I told him <a href="../spring03/3-9journal.html" target="_blank">it was over</a>.</p>
  <p>Before Spring Break, though, I had an interesting few evenings. There was one interaction with <a href="../spring03/3-9journal.html" target="_blank">Bryant</a> that had me thinking. I hadn't seen him since we broke it off, so that took me for a loop. Also, at a gathering at John's house, I had an interesting conversation with the aforementioned Matt Stephens that really stuck with me. I don't know why, but seeing him <a href="../spring03/3-9journal.html" target="_blank">cry in the rain</a> really hit me in a place I had never been touched before.</p>
  <p><strong>Bitch Fights and Happy Endings</strong></p>
  <p><a href="../springbreak/springbreak2003.html" target="_blank">Spring Break</a> was a whole lot of fun&#8212;the best ever. Missy, Sonya, Ilya, and I went to New Orleans and had a blast. I got some marginal action of the skank variety, and Missy had some fun with hand-cuffs. Also, some issues over some stolen alcohol kind of <a href="../spring03/3-30journal.html" target="_blank">soured things</a> between Sonya and I. That badness eventually spread to Missy, which resulted in a hugemongous bitch fight of epic proportions. Of course, I promised a psycho I wouldn't link to the good stuff...eternal sadness...</p>
  <p>I also got <a href="../spring03/3-30journal.html" target="_blank">elected</a> as Administrative Director for Lambda, which set me up for lots of work for my junior year&#8212;not to mention the summer. Missy got mono, I started to realize I had <a href="../spring03/4-13journal.html" target="_blank">feelings for Matt</a>, and I got to see the <a href="../spring03/4-13journal.html" target="_blank">Flaming Lips in concert</a>. Best concert in Athens ever!</p>
  <p>The highlight of the end of spring semester came with an <a href="../spring03/5-4journal.html" target="_blank">impromptu</a> trip to Atlanta with Barry, Stefanie, and Matt. After I had sent some strange signals to him over a few weeks (holding hands at <a href="../spring03/4-27journal.html" target="_blank">Chrissy's party</a>, obnoxiously playing <a href="../spring03/4-27journal.html" target="_blank">spin the bottle</a> until I got the pairing I wanted all along), things finally came to a head with the four of us sleeping together on Stefanie's not-so-big bed. He kissed me on my forehead, and I just sort of held him. On Wednesday, I called him and told him that I liked him, and wanted to pursue something. And that's how it began. Suddenly, Matt Stephens and I were an item.</p>
  <p>The summer started off really well. Missy and I threw a <a href="../spring03/5-11journal.html" target="_blank">Toga Luau</a>, I threw a <a href="../spring03/5-18journal.html" target="_blank">Buffy finale party</a>, and Barry, Stefanie, Matt and I got together to watch <em><a href="../spring03/5-11journal.html" target="_blank">Beauty and the Beast</a></em>. I also got a job at <a href="../spring03/5-18journal.html" target="_blank">Taco Mac</a> for the summer as a server&#8212;an impressive change of pace for me. I guess those three depressing weeks back during Christmas at Target were enough for me.</p>
  <p><strong>Good Dizzy and Flaming Lips</strong></p>
  <p>Taco Mac was very stressful for me. I made alot of money and finally got to take Matt out on <a href="../spring03/5-25journal.html" target="_blank">a</a> <a href="../spring03/6-1journal.html" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="../spring03/6-8journal.html" target="_blank">dates</a>. I was also stressed with Lambda stuff. I had to come back every other week to table for orientations, but the most fun was seeing Matt. We got to spend alot of quality time together at College Park (his apartment).</p>
  <p>I also got to spend alot of time with my friend, <a href="../spring03/6-8journal.html" target="_blank">Nicole</a>. She got to meet Matt before she moved to France. I even took her to a few parties that are worth noting. At John's going away bash, I had an unfortunate accident with a <a href="../spring03/7-6journal.html" target="_blank">flaming shot of Everclear</a>. I spent the party in the sink, and eventually went to the hospital. It sucked at the time, and I was really embarassed, but now it's a fun war story.</p>
  <p>I went to my first <a href="../spring03/6-29journal.html" target="_blank">Pride</a>, which was fun. We had some issues getting into Backstreet (thanks to Genevieve), but it really wasn't her fault. It was nice spending time with Marilia, my future roommate.</p>
  <p>What I remember most about that summer was falling in love with Matt. It happened one night when I was <a href="../spring03/6-8journal.html" target="_blank">rolling silverware</a> at Taco Mac, it just hit me. It was almost as if I had loved him all along, and that made me feel pretty incredible. I couldn't wait to see what the future held for the two of us.</p>
  <p>Quite a bit more, thankfully. Junior year was upon me, and I was moving off campus. If the summer was any indication, Lambda was going to be a headache. Also, I was at a point academically where I was unsure. I didn't know if I was just stupid or if I had just taken on too much. I decided I would take it easy in the Fall. </p>
  <p>Website wise, things were only getting better. By the end of sophomore year, I was Bloggin' more responsibly and working hard at a flashy new update. Maybe this website stuff could take me somewhere?</p>
  <p>Junior year&#8212;maybe  the most controversial (and certainly the raunchiest)&#8212;turned out to be my favorite year for the dumbest reasons. Stay tuned!
