      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/buffychosen.jpg" width="100" align="left" />All of my things are packed. The truck is outside. My house is empty. It's really over.<p>It's sad to say that this is my last Blog, but it really is. I have been doing this for so long, it's almost scary to think I'm not going to have a place to rant and be original. Blogging was the one thing that, despite my happiness or depression, I could always go and feel like myself again. For some reason, during my tenure here at UGA, having my own little log of events was somewhat of a comfort for me. I'm grateful that I found the energy and creativity to fuel a place like this.</p><p>But now I'm leaving it behind. I'm not getting a LiveJournal or anything like that, I'm just going away quietly. I don't think I see much reason to Blog any longer. I feel like the most exciting thing I can do now is to try my life off the radar, away from the assuming silence of this place. I can't tell you how much contempt I feel when I think of how many people I know (who supposidly love me and care about me) come here to see about me instead of speaking to me. I want to make it harder for them to keep tabs on me. I'm sick of being on the slab. I want to be free.</p><p>I feel, once I shead this, I truly can be. Something that has preoccupied my mind for so long&#8212;ever since I realized my Junior year that I had more time behind me than I had in front of me&#8212;is that one day I will have to leave. I knew then that Athens was not mine forever. It belonged to the underclassman and not to the graduates (unless you're lame enough to go to Grad school here or get a job). I knew that when my time came, I would have to find a new place to go so I could blaze a new trail.</p><p>That's what I wanted to find this summer, but that didn't happen. I'm going to Ohio so that I can keep looking, and though I once saw going here to be a solemn defeat, I don't feel that's completely true. I am leaving. I'm really getting out of this place and going far away to someplace that I have really never known before. Different people. Different circumstances. A whole new place to be me where I don't have to worry from what dark corner the past may come after me. For this, I am very excited.</p><p>I think so many people find safety in the places they've been before, but I don't want to meander. I want to go out and say at the end of the day that I took the big chances. Maybe that's why it's been harder for me. I know that's why I need more time, when I do find where I'm going, it will be very good. It will be worth it.</p><p>Oh, before my goodbyes, I must fulfill a Blogging icon tradition. I never had so many icons before, they truly were the best. Now they are all retired:</p><p align="center"><img src="spring05collage.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p><p>So, as I find myself reaching to bottom of the page, I just want to say thank you. Thanks for coming here, leaving comments, and reading my rants. Even if you hate me, there must be something here that keeps you coming back. Thanks for showing an interest.</p><p>I want to tell my friends that I love them and that I will miss them very much. I mean, you know I love you, I hate to make Friends Pages, and look how many I have! And those tribute Blogs are also a pain to write too. Reminiscence is exhausting, but I wouldn't have done it unless you were worth it.</p><p>I want to say that I truly will miss Athens. I know I have to leave, but I don't want to. I have had the time of my life here. I have fallen in love with your convoluted streets, classic atmosphere, and beautiful people. When I look back, the most memorable times I had  were when I was riding around town on my bike. I will miss the open air, the sunshine, and the many bike lanes. I really will.</p><p>And to everyone, I want to say that I will be back. I'm not sure when or for how long, but I promise I will be back. This place is too familiar and treasured for me to leave behind forever.</p><p>So that's it. Don't forget me, and if you want to find me, I'm not that hard to find.</p><p>Thanks again, and good-bye.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Free</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=34','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Happy Home</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 My Regret

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/kagomeregreticon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I have been promising this for months. I had planned on finishing it early this May, but my efforts to get someone to read the poem and comment on it went unacknowledged and unanswered. I'm sorry, I know that I am not the best poet in the world, but I try. Damnit, I went all the way up to Advanced Creative Writing and got an A, so I can't be that bad.<p>This is the last poem I am putting on my website.</p><p>The poem is called &quot;My Regret,&quot; and it is a continuation of the poem &quot;My Will,&quot; which I finished last year in May. I have been working on this poem since early February and in this time, it has truly become a living, breathing thing for me. The value I assign to this poem will probably only be wholly understood by me, but let me just say that finishing it is a great achievement for me. I am so happy to have to opportunity to share it with anyone who is interested in reading it.</p><p>Just so you know how it has come about, it all started one afternoon on the Athens bus. I knew I wanted to continue &quot;My Will,&quot; but I was uncertain what images I could use. All that came up into me were accusations and answers to questions I never heard asked: &quot;You think I'm crazy,&quot; I remember, were the first words that spawned the poem. As you can imagine, the poem surged in so many different directions from there.</p><p>As I mentioned, the poem is a continuation of &quot;My Will,&quot; which was inspired partly by the anime <em>Inuyasha</em>. In it, there is a love triangle between Inuyasha, a dead priestess Kikyo, and her reincarnation, a young girl named Kagome. You see, Inuyasha and Kikyo are lovers who are duped by a duplicitous demon into believing that they have betrayed eachother. In the ensuing duel, Kikyo losses her life, but is later resurrected. Her only hold on the living world is the intense hatred she felt for Inuyasha before her death&#8212;a hatred she is incapable of letting go of.</p><p>In the poem &quot;My Will,&quot; Inuyasha recounts his relationship with Kikyo and his frustrations over why she would ever think that he would have betrayed her. He is wounded in their fight, but recovers (as is revealed in &quot;My Regret,&quot; by the care of Kagome). He is shocked to find, years after her death, she has returned to him. She wants to be with Inuyasha. She wants to take him with her back to hell.</p><p>In the final line of the poem, as it seems obvious that Inuyasha should just let Kikyo die, he says to the absent figure, Kagome, &quot;Forgive my will, Kagome / You never had me,&quot; revealing that his love for Kikyo is indeed important enough for him to die for. In my poem &quot;My Regret,&quot; I explore Kagome's response to Inuyasha's choice.</p><p>If you know anything about me, you should know this poem has less to do with Inuyasha and more to do with the issues I have been dealing with in the past six months. You can see alot of that in this poem, and though I use the story as a source of inspiration and imagery, the act could have very well have happened to me&#8212;or anyone. The story is just a tool I manipulate to communicate my emotion, if that makes any sense.</p><p>Writing this poem was very important to me. I wanted to make something beautiful and enduring out of the misery and pain I felt after&#8212;well, after Matt left. It's not something unique to me, as many of my other poems have been. I imagine anyone who has had to experience someone they love leave them and not understand why will probably recognize the emotions of this poem.</p><p>Now that I have finished it, I am grateful that I took my time. &quot;Separation&quot; evolved under similar circumstances to this one, but so much more quickly. It was inspired by a  difficult &quot;situation,&quot; and though I still feel the poem has power and value, it is sloppy, unfocused, and almost entirely unrecognizable to anyone but me. &quot;My Regret,&quot; on the other hand, has changed from a string of personal questions and flashes of images into a woman's fevered hallucination aboard a crowded subway train. It's good, I don't need anyone to tell me it's good, I know it's good.</p><p>So, enough of this. I wrote it for Matt, just like I wrote &quot;My Will&quot; for Matt, because I feel emotion is not something you should keep inside. It is not something you let out in silently in dark corners. In this instance, the strong emotion I felt has become an enduring, beautiful thing that will live on and hopefully affect the lives of others. I hope that, if he does read it, he understands.</p><blockquote><i>This was your will<br>your fevered glance<br><br>And this is my regret.</i></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Translucent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=11','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Regret</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

There hasn't been one person who has been there for me more than my friend Genevieve.</p><p>We've been through alot together. Ever since I started my strange kick of running last Spring, no one has been there more than Genevieve to help get me past the fifth mile (well, maybe the second mile, but her leg hurt). She's always been there to give me a boost, whether it was moments when I feel like I'm losing my mind or even when I needed someone to help drive my car up to Ohio, she's always been getting me there.</p><p>This semester, Gen even leant me her bike to ride since I was worried that my K-mart P.O.S.'s wheel was about to fall off. I couldn't have done all that I did without her help. She was there for me when I had a very startling breakdown last January. She was the first person I called. God, she's even going to be there for me tomorrow, driving behind me as I take my things to Ohio and away from here. I don't think I've had a friend who has ever been so selfless.</p><p>I've given her things too, though. Mostly tofu, milkshakes, and aggrivation, though. We've had alot of fun this last semester, tofu burritos aside. One night, there was some late night swimming at her new apartment. Maybe I should have talked less about dietary stuff, though, but I like to look fondly on moments like that between us. Not alot of people try to get Gen, but I do. She's always been my best friend and she always will be.</p><p>That's what sucks about leaving. I really want to, you have no idea, but not because of Genevieve. God, I would stay just to be with someone like her. If I could take the good things with me, she would be at the top of my list (which is probably why she's coming along for the ride).</p><p>Just so you know, this is not the end for us. I forsee the two of us on some beach in Florida, steps from our back porch, walking with Kali thinking about days like this. Yup, together again, you will see.</p><p>So yah, I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss watching movies with beautiful women with her. I'm going to miss trips to Barberitos. And yes, I'm going to miss that terrible dog too.</p><p>It's a good thing I'm taking her with me. I've got a nice spot saved in my room where I can keep her ;-)</p><p>So I will never let her go.

	 117 Highland Park Dr.
	 
    </h3>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/rainbowinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />After a muted sigh in my upstairs hallway, I say to myself, &quot;This is it.&quot; I take one last jog down the stairs. Everything's packed. I've left nothing behind (except for a few lucky dust bunnies). Tonight, I leave my precious home behind.<p>I have to leave a tribute for this place. I've lived her for the past 2 years, for better or for worse, and it has become my one true home. While most of you have homes away from home, family members with whom you can stay with, I don't. Well, I do, but very far from here. Highland Park has been a comfort for me and a haven. I am thankful to have had such a wonderful time here.</p><p>When I think of my house, I remember the day I moved in. It was a crazy day. My sister had ditched me the night before, saying she would not help me move stuff with her car. Because of this, I had to borrow my aunt's van and make 2 trips to Athens myself. On the first trip, with the box spring of my bed strapped dangerously loose to the roof of the van, I listened to the radio with hopes of some musical goodness. To my delight, something truly special happened.</p><p>I should preface this. There are moments in my life when I am happy or sad, and sometimes these moments can be enriched by the presence of a song. In this moment, I was sublimely excited and anxious to finish moving things. It was at this very time, on the 99X RetroPlex, they played The Cure's &quot;Pictures of You,&quot; which I had grown very fond of over the summer. I don't think I ever belted out a song with such vigor in my whole life, it was a true joy. That was the beginning of my experience at Highland Park Dr.</p><p>My house became the antithesis of what dorm life was for me. I lived with people I knew and loved (or put up with, in the case of Milo). Also, my house played a significant role in my relationship with Matt, as he was unwilling to have me at his place and my space was alot bigger. When the two of us lost our cars, it also became often our only place to go. In these days, I think I enjoyed the house the most. It was boring, but it was a place I loved being with him. It was good then.</p><p>There were of course the parties. All two of them, both ending up with visits from the cops. Granted, I argued the one ticket down in court, but I could not risk having that many people over again. Oh, but they were good parties. Keg stands, body shots, and who can forget the orgy in Milo's room? I know I can't.</p><p>This year, though, things were different. I had 2 new roommates who were nothing like Marilia. Don't get me wrong, I think David was my favorite roommate ever. He was responsible, clean, and a good friend. I wish Marilia had stuck around, the three of us would have had an amazing time. Anyways, the place just got colder. Jennifer, my other new roommate, was always very standoffish, and the three of us never found a way to make it fun like the previous year.</p><p>And things got depressing. I began to see my house more and more as a prison than a haven. It was almost haunted with memories of the past&#8212;memories I wish I could push away. As my time at Highland Park dwindled, I became anxious for what was next.</p><p>Now that I'm leaving&#8212;now that the walls are painted, the floor is vacuumed, and my posters are off the wall&#8212;I feel sad. I see myself, in a year maybe, driving up to this place and remembering the good times and bad times with a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. It was my space, away from everything. It wasn't glamorous or even great location-wise, but it was mine.</p><p>And God, I will miss it.</p><p align="center"><img src="highland.jpg" width="350" height="261"></p><p>So, to my Athens home (pictured above during the big ice storm this past January), I say thank-you. I hope your next tenants love you as much as I did.</p><p>Oh, and sorry we fucked up the linoleum :-(</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Home</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=60','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Pictures of You</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

It's not something I found very easy. I think the only way I got through it at all is by not even believing it. I'm going to see her next week, I know it! But I won't. I won't see her for a long while coming.<p>From the moment I met her, I knew she was special. Something's in the name Padmini that screams, &quot;Remember me!&quot; As the legend goes, I did. Me and Padmini&#8212;or The Pad, as she was known as in those days&#8212;became fast friends.</p><p>As wonderful as Junior year was for me, I found that I had really drifted away from people I didn't mean to. Padmini was one of them. Maybe it was the excess of roaches in her apartment or the fact that she only had one Sunday potluck, but I just didn't see her that much. That didn't mean I didn't see her ever, though. Nope, it was I who was there to witness her down her first pint of beer on her 21st Birthday: the stout Guiness, which she didn't end up finishing. And I did get the chance to see her at D.C. Pride. She had such a posh pad and the rats were all sorts of enormous (good thing they were only outside).</p><p>This year Padmini has been one of my best friends. Like some of my other awesome peoples, she really enriched my last two semesters at UGA. Though I may be jealous of her superior English-major brain, I adore her attendence of all the lesser known sausage festivals along with the drunk phone conversations that inevitably follow. Watching <em>Showgirls</em> for the first time would not have had the same kick if our drunk little Padmini wasn't chiming in with comments and outrageous outbursts.</p><p>And let's not forget her fabulous taste in movies that do not star Elizabeth Burkley. She showed me <em>La Mala Educaci&oacute;n</em>, <em>The Aviator</em>, and that wierd movie with the lady who did abortions and liked to drink tea. This summer has been just keen because of <i>Padmini</i>'s constant demand for delicious varieties of ice cream (and, by the way, you really knocked it out of the park with Graham Slam, girl). Oh, urr, or was it me who forced ice cream down our throats :-/</p><p>So yah, I can't say goodbye to movie nights, wine nights, crazy photographs at Jerm's apartment&#8212;it's not possible for me. I feel like I'm going to see her very soon and I'm just going to go with that feeling. I know I'm going to see her tomorrow.</p><p>I just know it. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Fabulous</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=59','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Flaming Lips - <em>All We Have is Now</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/runbabyrun.jpg" width="100" align="left" />For my last week of Blogging, I'm sending out a few tributes. There is a small handful of people that have made my last semester in Athens worthwhile. The first little tribute went out to my good friend  Jeremy. I got Marilia down when she left for Chile. Missy got hers this week. This one belongs to Leena.<p>Last night, I got a call from Leena. She wanted to go downtown, one last time before we went out separate ways. It's funny, I was looking forward to sitting at home and watching <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em> for the third time, but somehow that all melted away when I heard she was going out. If it was anyone else, I would have just told them, &quot;Some other time,&quot; but for Leena, I'd go. That girl is worth it.</p><p>I was passed out for most the late afternoon because I had been moving furniture all day. Let me just say I'm very happy to be rid of my washer and dryer. God, those things were heavy. When I woke up and talked to Leena, I jumped in the shower and hurried my little butt to her apartment so we could get going.</p><p>The finer details of the evening are not important. We went to a few bars, had alot to drink, and shared some thoughts. We came to the decision that we couldn't refuse compliments given to eachother. She thinks I'm hot and I won't correct her. I think she's just fucking amazing, and she can't argue with me about it.</p><p>I don't know if there's anything more I can say than this: I haven't been happy this year. It's hard to find the motivation to be the patient and adventurous person I used to be. I told Leena last night that, more than anyone else, spending time with her (whether it be at the front of the stage at a Krush Girls show or it be a cool spring afternoon lunch at the Grit) has made me the happiest I have been this year. When I'm with her, I forget my stupid problems and just have about as much fun as possible.</p><p>It's sad to say, but I would have never expected to be so close to Leena. We drifted away for a few years but came back together. I'm really going to miss her alot, but I'm sure she'll learn lots cutting up cadavers.</p><p>Hey, that's one way I can get into MCG...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Girl Scout Cookie Shooters </td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=58','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Kelly Clarkson - <em>Since U Been Gone</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 Things I Cannot Change

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/buffybrokenicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />The power just went out. I almost instinctively turned the song on. Could you blame me? It's all I think about in this room.<p>This story will become legend, as far as this website is concerned. It was during a blackout that Matt told me he was leaving me. During the biggest hurricane of 2004. I brought it up in <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/fall04/9-12-04journal.html">"Concession."</a> I'll bring it up in the Senior Blog. And, yeah, I'm bringing it up now.</p><p>I haven't Blogged about him once this semester. Well, that's not entirely true, but I hid that entry. It doesn't count. I thought I'd bring it up once more, at least, since his leaving has had such a profound impact on me. It's important that I be honest. If it really is supposed to end like this, then the only luxuries I can be afforded are my memories.</p><p>You might think that I don't remember. You might think that I have gotten over it entirely. And you might be right, I have come a long way and I intend to go further. So if I am still under this weather, than the storm is passing.</p><p>But that doesn't mean I don't think about him. It doesn't diminish the weight of the things I said and the love I had for him. And, to my dismay, it doesn't lessen the extent that I am confounded by his decision to leave me. He was my best friend and now he is a phantom. He is a collection of things I have put into a box which I am unwilling to tape shut.</p><p>I spent the semester preparing for the possibility that he would never speak to me again. I didn't think he was capable of it, and though I was wrong, I nonetheless anticipated his cruelty. The night that I decided I was ready to e-mail him, I felt something I did not expect: shame. Trying to talk to him after he did what he did to me cost me precious self-respect, something I did not have much to give. I cried for him over forgotten idols in an empty room hoping he would show me something more than vicious silence. I bit my lip and wiped the tears from my face, hoping that if I could defeat the demons he left behind with me, I could at least be his friend. If I could do that, I would at least have solace.</p><p>He didn't respond and I never asked why. I never tried again, though I promised myself I would. I won't though. I don't want to surrender anymore of my self-respect to him.</p><p>I'm terrified that I might see him. The thought of running into him makes my heart leap into my throat. I have never felt this way about anyone. To have to face him unprepared and completely out of the blue is the one thing God has kept from me, and for that I am thankful. I'm not ready for that, but one day, I hope I will be. If I am going to see him again, it will have to be on his terms.</p><p>You see, the one thing I learned in all of this is that I must learn to accept the things I cannot change. If he wanted to see me, I am not hard to find. If he wanted to be my friend, he knows I am willing. There's no one I have ever loved more, and he knows that.</p><p>Since I don't anticipate seeing him before I leave or at any point in the near future, I find myself looking to the horizon. I'm sick of sitting in this empty place that reminds me of the happiness I once had. I resent the people who ignore my loss and pretend I have not been severely beaten.</p><p>In leaving, I hope to find the ability to put this all behind me like everyone else has. But for now, as I empty my room and surrender this place, I remember.</p><p>And regret.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Shameful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=24','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Fleetwood Mac - <em>Sara</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/twineicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Well, one last drunken weekend has come and gone. And here's one last Blog recounting the events.<p>Missy came up this weekend, to my surprise. I didn't have any exciting plans, though, which is as per usual. Marilia agreed to partake in some Bacardi with me on Friday and I tried to invite some people over my place. It seems that everyone was busy. You know, too busy sleeping or being anti-social or whatever. Bastards.</p><p>It was around that time that Missy gave me a call and told me she wanted to come downtown with her. I wasn't that enthused about it, but it seemed better than sitting at home. Since Marilia and I were plastered at that point, I begged Missy to come get me which she sadly refused. I just sat in my room downloading songs from <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em> resigned to the fact that I would not be going out. But, low and behold, Missy called me back and said she'd come get me. She earned uber brownie points for that :-D</p><p>So we went downtown and I brought the bottle of Bacardi along. Missy had this ingenious plan of taking it with us and mixing our own drinks from cheap Diet Cokes from the bar. However, none of us had a jacket to hide it in. To my dismay, Missy took one look at the loose jeans around my waist and said, &quot;Just put it in your pants!&quot; So Missy shoves the bottle of Bacardi down my backside and I walk around the whole night with it virtually in my ass. It was not comfortable, believe me.</p><p>We went to All Good, the bar that used to be Gator Haters. I was really impressed with it! It had a very nice downstairs and upstairs, and there was even a back porch on the roof. The Bacardi idea worked really well especially since the bartender had no problem giving Missy free Diet Cokes. I had fun talking to people and seeing people I didn't expect to see. Sigh...</p><p>On Saturday, I went to the Campus Lodge pool with Missy and Claire to lay out and swim. We had a nice time, and Missy wanted to go downtown again. I had some dinner at Stevi B's with Gen and I headed home to get ready. Missy came by to get ready and, oddly enough, she complimented my shower. I don't know why, but that made me feel good. I don't really like my shower.</p><p>After some drama involving a hair dryer, we headed downtown with Marilia and went to Cutter's and All Good again. It wasn't as fun as the night before, and Missy disappeared with some guy, but I had a good time with Marilia. We went to the Grill afterward. I spilt my milkshake and dropped a pepper shaker. I felt really bad about that :'( We went home and it was really strange, my roommate came back at the same time. She moved all of her stuff out last week, it was really strange seeing her.</p><p>It wasn't a good day for her today, though. She was moving out one of her larger furniture pieces &#8212;the television unit&#8212;and she dropped the corner onto her foot and ripped off her big toe nail. It sounded excruciating, she does not handle pain very well, and she had to go to the hospital. Her parents seemed really nice, though. I wish I could have met them under different circumstances.</p><p>Anyways, so that was my weekend. I even added a new secret entry to my Blog. This is much more upbeat, so that's good. I'm such a dork sometimes.</p><p>And I said goodbye to Missy today. I don't know when I'll see her again, but I look forward to whenever that is. She was the one of the most important people I met at UGA and I'm really going to miss her.</p><p>This will be a big Blog week, I promise. On Sunday, you can expect the final update. I will also post my Senior Year Blog before the end of the week. Also, the poem I've been writing will make its debut. Also, I have been anxiously awaiting the writing of my last Blog entry. Can you believe it? I will probably Blog alot this week anyways since its the last week.</p><p>Oh, and apologies for the recent mainstream mp3's in my radio.blog. I guess I'm just partial to cute boy rock bands as of late.</p><blockquote><em>Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity<br>And I've been locked inside that house<br>All the while you hold the key<br>And I've been dying to get out<br>And that might be the death of me<br>And even though there's no way in knowing where to go<br>Promise I'm going because I gotta get outta here...</em></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Hungry</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=57','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Relient K - <em>Be My Escape</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
