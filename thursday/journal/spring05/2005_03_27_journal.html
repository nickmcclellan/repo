I wanted to make my final entry of the week before I lost consciousness.<p>I didn't think I'd go out tonight. I had very finite plans of finishing something tonight in a very specific place. Unfortunately for those plans, I sort of got caught in the ebb and flow of this very special Friday night. Lots of wine and other alcoholic beverages were had, but that wasn't the point. No, it never is.</p><p>There's something about staying up until past 5 in the morning that seems to put me at peace. While I left Missy and Leena to their boys of the evening (or the morning at this point), I walked from Baldwin Village to Polk St. to pick up my car. I'm just so confused right now. What am I supposed to do exactly? Please let me know, because I'm at a complete loss at this point. </p><p>Tomorrow (or today), I will finish. For now, I need to sleep. Lots of sleep.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Worried</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=24','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Fleetwood Mac - <em>Sara</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/darkkagomeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Isn't all this rain nice? I was so impressed that these thunderstorms have not come 'a thundering during the most inopportune times&#8212;by that I mean when I'm riding my bike between classes. That would be unfortunate. Luckily, I'm through with all the necessary biking for this week at least. I just have one more 6 mile run before I can kick my feet up, as they say, and watch the rain fall. I had such a pleasant run last Saturday, I will hopefully repeat it this weekend.<p>But necessary sunshine aside, it was nice to wake up to the sound of thunder this morning. That's not something that happens every day.</p><p>Yesterday was pretty busy. Full day of classes <em>and</em> there's was this pesky book for my Chaucer class that I was absolutely unable to locate. I mean, I haven't gone to Borders yet, but I doubt the <em>Book of Margery Kempe</em> is on their shelves. I was petrified of going to class yesterday. I skipped Monday because I didn't have time to find the book over the weekend, so I couldn't skip again. Ultimately, I risked embarassment at the feet of Shutters and braved the discussion taking extensive, involved notes on virtually every aspect of the class (most notably Shutters's inabilty to form a sentence and my odd craving for egg rolls. By the way, are those vegetarian?)</p><p>Things worked out though. I went running in the afternoon. It was just right, and on a liberating and strange note, I was compelled to run shirtless. Who goes driving down the tawdry backroads by Cedar Shoals anyways? Plus, my very pale flesh could use some rays. It was kind of nice. Almost like some lost high school dream come true. I can run shirtless and not be embarassed or ashamed. Go me :-)</p><p>I also taught sans Diane last night. Only two students showed up, which was incredibly depressing since I had planned an activity requiring eight people. I did teach them the word &quot;lemonade&quot; and also explained what the verb &quot;to cheat&quot; means.</p><p> &quot;<em>Mentir!</em>&quot; they said to me, as if the bewitching fog that is English was permeable for the moment. </p><p>&quot;Yes, <em>como mentiroso</em>," I said to them. "Like a liar.&quot;</p><p>Also, in addition to <em>Bleed Like Me</em>, which I will be adding to my garbage album collection very soon, I am looking forward to the new New Order album. I don't have any of their albums, sadly, but I'm looking for <em>Get Ready</em>, but I haven't found it yet (I haven't looked very hard though). Maybe my new found appreciation for all things New Order will evolve into a Flaming Lips-like behavior in which I purchase  every album beginning with the most recent. With the 'Lips, I'm currently at <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>. Now, which album came before that??</p><p>Anyways, this is becoming long-winded. I should go to my boring composition class. You know, someone might cough. I could miss that.</p><p>Later.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Resigned</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=23','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Krafty</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/kikyoshouldericon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I updated the front page of my website.  I know, surprise surprise! Who goes there anyways?  Anyone who's anyone knows that the Blog is where all the action happens.  Well, you should check it out.  I did some subtle things with the CSS that should expand site wide eventually.  What?  You don't know <em>where</em> the front page is?  Well, since you're too lazy to click that flashy &quot;Thursday&quot; at the top of the page, you can just click this <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/" target="_blank">here</a> ordinary link.  There you go, are you happy?<p>I announced on the front page that I'll be making some more Friends Pages along with the few I still have left to refit. The first up will be Diane, my charming ESOL co-teacher. I've known her for a long time, but she has always been simply a friend of someone who is special to me. I guess that just made her a friend of consequence, not <em>really</em> my own friend.</p><p>Well, that's not true anymore. I've taught with Diane for almost two semesters now and she's introduced me to humus. We've learned names together, we've made bingo boards, and we've depended on eachother almost every week. She's Friends Page worthy, damnit. I just thought I'd let you know that. Plus, there's this cool picture with a bug on her head that I'm going to put on the page. I mean, how cool is that?</p><p>This is the week that I'm going to finish things. I'm going to make that prediction. I don't feel any different right now, but I know this week is different. I don't know how much will change this week, but that's not up to me, is it? I have so much to do. I think I'll kick things off with a nice lunch with Leena. My Chaucer class is due for a skip anyways. It's one of the many perks of getting an A on my last paper.</p><p>I also wanted to post because, first off, I hate Mondays. I hate waking up the for the first time in the same bed next to the same clock going to the same shower riding the same bike to the same bus stop going to the same library that I've gone to the past 3 months. I posted also because I think the L word is a cool show. I think Bette is hot&#8212;I love Jennifer Beals.</p><p>And I posted because I want to say I'm diggin' <em>Skyline Pigeon</em> this night. My mom told me to download it&#8212;she insisted. So I did it, like the good son. I was listening to it when I was running up the hill on Broad St. before Lumpkin St. on Saturday. It was right after Genevieve said her legs hurt too much and she had to walk. I asked her if she wanted me to walk with her. She looked at me and said, &quot;No. You go on.&quot; So I did.</p><p>The song rocks, that's all. Even though today will be the same Monday, the song makes me feel like it could be different. Maybe the time has come.</p><blockquote><em>Just let me wake up in the morning<br>To the smell of new mown hay<br>To laugh and cry, to live and die<br>In the brightness of my day<br><br>I want to hear the pealing bells<br>Of distant churches sing<br>But most of all please free me<br>From this aching metal ring<br>And open out this cage towards the sun<br></em></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Hopeful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=22','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Elton John - <em>Skyline Pigeon</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
