The Flaming Lips, the 40 Watt:</strong> I went to this concert during my sophomore year, during the spring of 2003. It was the one time I ever saw April in Athens. The concert was so big, it pulled her out of Athens with her boyfriend Matt. Padmini and I think Vicki were also there. I tried to arrive early so I could be one of the audience members who got dressed up in the animal suits from the &quot;Do You Realize?&quot; video. No such luck.<p>The show started with large rubber balls flying through the air. It was a real thrill because the roof of the 40 Watt is so low, almost all of the balls were burst before the band even walked out. Wayne Coyne emerged from backstage in that recognizable suit, and the show began&#8212;with &quot;Fight Test,&quot; I believe. I could be wrong, as phenomenal the show was, I just don't remember. Behind the band was a large high-definition screen that played these bizarre movies during the set. During &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots,&quot; Wayne had this small boxing nun he put on the big screen through a camera in his microphone and he instructed us all to sing along.</p><p>The show was just great, they played alot of songs I loved, and they even played a song I was hoping they would play: &quot;All We Have is Now.&quot; It seemed so unlikely they would play it, but it was one of their last songs. That was just too cool. The intimacy and energy of that show has never been reproduced for me, and I feel privileged to have seen a band like the Flaming Lips in a place like the 40 Watt.</p><p><strong>2. Lauryn Hill, the Classic Center:</strong> My sister and Genevieve went with me for this one. When I heard Lauryn Hill was coming to Athens, I was both shocked and excited. I got up so early that morning to get in line for the show. Though it was my freshman year at UGA and I was poor, I didn't even skimp on the cheap seats. I wanted to be front row, center (though we were more middlish center for the actual show). Jen thought that she'd play alot of the songs from her first album&#8212;the really popular ones. I had heard she was coming out with an MTV Unplugged album, so I wasn't sure what to expect.</p><p>If I could say anything about that concert, it would be that it was less a musical experience as it was a spiritual one for me. She was so candid and open to the audience. She just sat up there with her acoustic guitar and a book of songs, flipping through it, playing chords she had learned, and explaining to us why she had written what she did. It was so beautiful, and I don't think anyone could discern a set list from the whole thing. Jen was bored as hell, but I was so into it.</p><p>My favorite song of the evening was one that didn't show up on the Unplugged album, it was a song called &quot;Selah,&quot; for her daughter. She said she wrote to song specifically to be different than the song to her son Zion. It's funny how she denounced everything &quot;To Zion&quot; ever stood for in favor of the stark reality of her selfishness she revealed in &quot;Selah.&quot; She told us that everyone wants to believe when she found out she was having a baby that she felt an overwhelming sense of happiness and entitlement, but &quot;Selah&quot; told it how it really was. We're all selfish and cruel, and I really value her and her music for telling us that.</p><p><strong>3. Madonna, Washington D.C.:</strong> I wouldn't think this show would have been so high up on this list, but it really did give me a profound respect for the material girl. Though I listen to a most bizarre variety of music (who listens to Japanese mp3's?), I do listen more or less to pop music. Madonna is a goddess of pop, and I guess I just never realized it. I mean, I didn't even own a real copy of <em>The Immaculate Collection</em>, I only had a burned copy of it.</p><p>The show started with this really cool jumbo screens with these really lavishly produced videos of a woman (I assumed it was Madonna) doing all this strange poses. The screens started to fall away and separate, eventually falling back to their own sides of the stage. Then, all of a sudden, as the odd &quot;book excerpt&quot; sequence was over, I hear the words, &quot;What are you looking at!&quot; come blaring out of the silence. I mean, from that point on, the show was just awesome. Her stuff from <em>American Life</em> was even good, I couldn't believe it.</p><p>My favorite song was when she dedicated &quot;Crazy For You&quot; to the fans. That was really nice, she hadn't played many of her classics at her shows in recent years. My second favorite was &quot;Vogue,&quot; which as a consequence was swiftly added to my mp3 collection and given 5 stars on my iPod.</p><p><strong>4. U2, Phillips Arena:</strong> I went to this show to see garbage perform live for the first time ever in my life. They were opening for U2, and though Missy and I were poor little freshman (we got seats <em>behind</em> the main stage), we were able to make it down to the show. garbage rocked, as per usual. Seeing that they don't play very much of their <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> stuff nowadays, it's nice to know I got to hear songs like &quot;Drive You Home&quot; and &quot;Cherry Lips&quot; live at some point.</p><p>U2 was just amazing. It's like a pilgrimage, everyone needs to go at least once. Bono is just so alive on stage, and he is so intuned to the audience (and he even shot us glances from the stage&#8212;I guess he felt sorry for us cheap skates). At one point, he brought a fan up who had a sign saying it was his dream to play guitar with the band, at least once. Bono made that dream a reality, and that was just so awesome to see. Also, all the 9/11 tribute stuff just a mere 2 months since the tragedy was all really touching. I got chills.</p><p><strong>5. Garbage, the Tabernacle:</strong> I'm putting this her just for good measure. Sure, it might be higher on the list if they played &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; or did some fabulous stunt like they did in D.C. (did you hear about that??) It still rocked to hear &quot;Vow&quot; and &quot;Supervixen&quot; and also to see Shirley chew us out for dropping our glasses.</p><p>I totally just wrote all about this, that uber entry is still around for your perusing, so get to it. </p><center><hr color="#FFFAFA" width="50%" noshade></center><br><p>That is all.</p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Awake</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Lauryn Hill - <em>So Much Things to Say</em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

    <h3 class="post-title">A Disingenuous Prioress</h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/treeinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />My last paper is done! I worked on it for several hours on Sunday night after taking a necessary break to watch the L-word. That show really is good, I thought the episode Sunday would suck, but it turned out to be really good. After that spot of sugary goodness, I plugged away at a paper titled, &quot;Chaucer the Poet and the Anti-Semitic Prioress.&quot; I think it turned out really well. I don't think I've every researched as thoroughly for any other paper. I think, as per tradition of my recent undergraduate papers, the thesis was provocative and poised. The argument was interesting and inspired. I am quite honestly anticipating an A. I won't find out that until Monday, though.<p>This week, I'm focusing on getting a job! My resume is done, I'm about to get my cover letter critiqued, and I will hopefully be sending out a flood of &quot;hire me please!&quot; packets very soon. I have my eyes set on this one group of papers in Maryland. That would be awesome, I think the qualifications they are looking for match me well. Hopefully it's a good fit. I've also been interested in some papers out in California, but my friends and family keep giving me objections like, &quot;It costs too much to live out there! It's too far!&quot; I don't care, the farther the better. I just hope it's sunny wherever I end up.</p><p>This Saturday, I'm going to run in the Athens Twilight 5K Run. This will be the first time ever I've been at UGA that I've participated in anything to do with Athens Twilight. I'm not sure what I was doing the last two years&#8212;I think I was being a sore thumb or something. My first year, I remember I was on the outs with Gen and Missy and I went home to fix my alternator or something. How lame.</p><p>I'm really excited about Saturday, though. As any Blog reader would know, I've been training for months. It hasn't been necessarily for this 5K, I've just been running in general, and my stamina is up so much more than it was when I ran that Jingle Bell 5K last December. Wouldn't it be cool if I qualified for the 1 mile race? I highly doubt it, but I will certainly try to set a personal best. Hopefully bananas and smoothies will greet me at the finish line. Oh joy!</p><p>I should also mention that I will be having my postponed tofu party <em>this Saturday!</em> That's right, all you tofu hungry jerks had better save some room (or make some tofu of your own, because it's a potluck!) I mentioned to Padmini that we should set up a facebook party group for it, but she vetoed that idea. I guess you'll just have to announce to me your desire to go, and I'll forward the much needed directions. It should be a night of vegetarian deliciousness.</p><p>Maybe I'll finally do something I want to do tonight. The Junior Blogs are done, I just need to finish writing the retrospective Junior Blog thingy. Could I finish it tonight? Don't see why not, it's not like I have a paper to write. We'll see.</p><p>I think I'll go get some pizza and pick up that new New Order album, for now. Thank God it's Tuesday.</p><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Contemplative</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

    <h3 class="post-title">Old Friends</h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="http://www.arches.uga.edu/~yoshiboi/journal/05icons/bleedshirlicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Before I start plugging away on the last paper of my undergraduate experience here at UGA, I just want to go into what happened Saturday.  It was a truly special day.<p>Well, I woke up alittle later than I had hoped. I wanted to get out the door running by 9 or 10 a.m., but that turned out to be more around 10:20. I find it really hard to start running in the morning, especially when it's the first thing I do all day. Who's to say I have the physical strength to eclipse six miles that early in the morning? Well, eventually I started going at it.</p><p>It was an uneventful run. Disappointing in only one sense: lately, I have been allowing myself to walk. No, not like I used to walk a substantial portion of the circuit when I had run in the past, nothing like that. I just stop somewhere briefly, for maybe 50 paces, and walk. It's always a let down for me. I wish I had the strength to run the whole thing every time.</p><p>Someone did yell out their car at me. I don't even know what they said, but I was surprised how much it didn't bother me. I noticed that people do stupid stuff like that when I started riding my bike home from school. Some people can't help but to honk and yell at you to humiliate you. I don't know why anyone would do something like that. I thought about it alot, then finished my run with an extra sprint to my door to make up for those 50 paces.</p><p>After that, I was off to Marietta as fast as I could to see Nicole. She was having a cookout, like I mentioned, and I wanted to get there early so I could have some one-on-one time with her. I really do consider her one of my best friends, and I wanted a chance to connect with her personally. It was probably stupid, but it turned out well.</p><p>I went straight to her house and as soon as I saw her, I gave her a big hug. I shook her brother Conrad's hand. He'd definitely beefed up since the last time I saw him. Nicole's parents were really funny. They kept asking how I had been and I told them I'd be graduating in a three weeks. They'd get all suggestive to Nicole at that point, saying to me, &quot;Wow, graduating in <em>four years</em>, that really great!&quot; They enjoy giving their daughter a hard time about her choice to go to a law school in France, but she's sure she made the right decision. It's certainly made her happy, that's for sure.</p><p>Nicole and I ducked out long enough to take a stroll through he McEachern campus. It hasn't changed much. There's many more vending machines and recycling bins, which is both good and bad. It looks alot smaller, though. I guess Nicole and I, at some point, outgrew this place. It can't hold us anymore.</p><p>We went back for the food part of the cookout, and April showed up. I insisted on veggie burgers, and the Levesque clan suddenly started a vein of conversation on vegetarianism, which didn't turn out so bad. I think alot of people liked the veggie burgers. Nicole's grandmother kept asking what they were made out of.</p><p>After the family fun, we decided to go out and get a drink. We went down another walk down memory lane&#8212;at least for me. It was the first time I had been to my old Taco Mac since I lasted worked there. No one recognized me at all, which was alright. We had a very pricey pitcher of margaritas and Nicole had a Sweet Georgia Brown. I promised her when I went to see her in Angers this summer I'd try beer. For the first time.</p><p>April had a Mudslide which really turned out to be a fancy name for an alcoholic milkshake. Interesting concept&#8212;Nicole even recalled the days back at McEachern when I used to dip my french fries in my milkshakes at school. Even I had forgot I started that strange habit with her. Anyways, we didn't dip french fries in April's mudslide. We got alittle smashed, praised our server, and moved the party back to my house.</p><p>Jen got us some spirits and we continued there. Nicole got really drunk and frisky. There was some nominal kissing. I only mention this because I know Nicole's boyfriend Alain doesn't know a lick of English. She was tired, so April took her home. I gave her a big hug, told her I loved her, and that I'd be coming to see her very soon. Far, far away from here.</p><p>I didn't want to stay in Marietta, so I had numerous glasses of water to wash the Hurricanes and Amaretto Sours from my system. I had so much water that before I left my sister's house I think I peed like 3 times. I even had to stop at the QuikTrip on 316 to use the bathroom, I was about the explode. I never stop to use the bathroom. And I always thought I had the strongest of bladders.</p><p>One freak occurrence though, I was wearily cruising at 75 mph about to get on the loop when a cop ahead of me in the medium flashed his lights on quickly and turned them off. It shocked me completely awake. I got down to 55 mph so fast, I don't think he had the heart to pull me over. I thought I was a goner for sure. I arrived home safely, so don't worry.</p><p>So that was Saturday. Now it's Sunday and I have so many things to finish. Maybe at the end of <em>this</em> week, things will be different. We will certainly see.</p><blockquote><i>In my happy home I barely breathe<br>I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out</i></blockquote><div align="right"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Weary</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="2" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">garbage - <em>Happy Home </em></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/archive.html">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
