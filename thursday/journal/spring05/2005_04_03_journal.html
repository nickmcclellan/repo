	 Density of Failure
	 
    </h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/kikyowhiteicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Tonight, I saw <em>Showgirls</em> again&#8212;this time with commentary!  I actually watched it a few weeks ago w/ Jerm, Adam, and the Pad (been a while since I called her that).  I don't think I mentioned this, but that movie is amazing.  It is immaculate.  It cannot be put into words.  As David Schmader, our glorious commentator put it, &quot;Showgirls triumphs in that every single person involved in making the film is making the worst possible decision at every possible time. It is this incredible density of failure that makes <em>Showgirls</em> sublime.&quot;  If you haven't seen this movie, your life is incomplete.  And I mean that.</p><p>I also did the running today. That turned out well. I've been feeling really burnt though. I guess it's all the running and biking I did this last week. Genevieve said she thought I had a tan. That's pretty cool. Despite the upcoming garbage week, I still intend to run my little heart out, so maybe my color change will continue. I don't think I've enjoyed Spring this much (you know, with all the outside physical activity) since...well, ever.</p><p>I talked to April today. Oh, not sexy brave Niger April. She's where the telephones can't reach her, sadly. I'm talking about <em>the</em> April. April Smith. Long-lost high school best friend April. Her reason for calling me was to get my address to send me her graduation announcement, but I know it's really because she misses her Nick in her life. We talked forever about a whole lot of stuff. I even scored an invite for Wednesday night to watch anime and even sleep in her bed! I'm looking forward to it. It's just not the same without her.</p><p>This weekend I finished my Junior Year Blogs. I haven't written the whole retrospective thing yet. That takes some time and excessive hyperlinking. I just want to say that my Spring 04 Blog was just about the best layout ever for the site. I mean, this whole &quot;flower power&quot; Blogger-induced fantasty is great, but the whole gray, black, and white thing w/ icons is when I really began to shine as a Blogger. I can promise you my modernization of the layout makes it look 10 times more amazing than it did last year. I guess you'll just have to enjoy all that after I decide to upload. I'll give you a heads up, at least. Maybe after garbage week.</p><p>And with that, let the games begin. Nothing personal. Nothing transparent. Only garbage&#8212;nothing else. I may impart some personal stuff regarding myself and my experience with garbage, but don't anticipate current events. I know, I know, I'm lame, but I can use my soapbox for anything I want, so there.</p><p>I promise. It won't suck. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Longing</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=26','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Biff Naked - <em>Lucky</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 Away From Here
	 
    </h3>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/kakikyoicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Well, there's good news and bad news.<p>Good news first. I'm posting! It's not that I haven't wanted to post or anything. I guess I just wanted to put my website energies into something else. For one, I have finished recoding the entire site. I have no idea if it will make any difference, really. Basically, one stylesheet governs all non-Blog content. It just means whenever I decide to finish the website and want to convert some of those pages to the older themes, that's going to be a real sinch. Also, it sort of means if I ever wanted to update the site again, it would be extremely easy. Too bad that's not going to happen :-) </p><p>Also, I got 2 new garbage b-sides this week! I haven't got a new b-side since &quot;I Just Want to Have Something to do Tonight&quot; way back in 2003. They're called &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; and &quot;Nobody Can Win.&quot; I really like them! It's so nice listening to new garbage since I've restricted myself from previewing the new album that comes out Tuesday.</p><p>I really enjoy &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone.&quot; I remember reading in Shirley Manson's Internet Journal about it. It really is a catchy song even if it's a bit short and somewhat incomplete. It compelled me to ride my bike home 4 times this week! Gee whiz, that's every day so far! Keen :-D </p><p>&quot;Nobody Can Win&quot; is alright, I suppose it may grow on me. Something about the lyrics that really turn me off. Oh well, I suppose there's some reason why they're b-sides, right?</p><p>Ok, the bad news. Next week is the release of the fourth garbage album. In observation of this very special time, I intend to Blog on nothing but garbage. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I'm going to Blog on the first three garbage albums and all stuff involved with their obvious fabulousness. On Wednesday, once I've had ample time to listen to <em>Bleed Like Me</em> over and over again, I will dole out my first review. Then, after a break on Thursday to attend the garbage concert, on Friday I'll give my review of the show. For Saturday, I suppose I'll Blog about b-sides, just to give the week some closure. Sounds ambitious, but I think it will be so much fun! I'm so excited about next week. I so glad I've saved myself for the new album and will be hearing it for the first time Tuesday. My iPod will be singing nothing but garbage for some time to come, I'm sure.</p><p>Other than all that garbage, I've finished my resume and even ran it under Fink's nose. He asked me if I was gay today! It was funny. He also said that copy editors were in high demand, so I'm excited about that. Maybe I will be editing for some major metro paper after all. This weekend I'd like to start to set my sights on some jobs. That's really the only thing I need to do at this point. I have no idea where I want to go, I just know I don't want to be here.</p><p>Anyways, that's all I wanted to Blog for now. I will chime in before Sunday, so until then.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Waiting</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=25','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Snow Patrol - <em>Run</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
