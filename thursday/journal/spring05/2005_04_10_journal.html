      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/bsidesicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I never knew what a b-side was, did you?  It wasn't until one day, I was driving around Kennesaw and decided to go to Media Play and browse the garbage section, looking for something interesting.  I saw a single to &quot;I Think I'm Paranoid&quot; that came with two unreleased tracks:  &quot;Deadwood&quot; and &quot;Afterglow.&quot;  What was this, I thought I had heard every garbage song?!  I very quickly bought the pricey import and stuffed in my car's CD player, hearing a garbage b-side for the first time.<p>Basically, any good band will make as many as 25 songs for an album. Obviously, some are better than others. With every garbage album, the band has released about 8 b-sides, on average. Some of them are really good. I'm sure everyone's heard &quot;#1 Crush,&quot; from the <em>Romeo + Juliet</em> soundtrack. That was actually a remix of a b-side. There are also b-sides that are good, but really undeveloped compared to the album tracks. For example, the recent b-side &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; is really good musically, but it sounds like it needs another verse or something. Also, alot of fans really loved &quot;Use Me,&quot; but I always thought it was overwritten.</p><p>Then, at least how I see it, there's always one or two b-sides that are so bizarre and experimental, they could never be on a garbage album because the world just isn't ready. &quot;Alien Sex Fiend&quot; is a prime example&#8212;what's going on there?? I remember when I heard &quot;Tornado,&quot; from <em>Version 2.0</em>, for the first time, I hated it so much. Since then, I've grown to appreciate how much it truly rocks. <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> had many of these experimental songs. &quot;Happiness Pt. 2&quot; was probably alittle too strange, and &quot;I'm Really Into Techno&quot; was cool because it's the only garbage song that Shirley doesn't sing on. Personally, &quot;Confidence&quot; was always my favorite. It's got that cool noise in it, and Shirley's all deep throated. It rocks.</p><p>Once I realized buying each import single was going to be too expensive, I began to collect b-sides over the Internet. I'd download them onto my father's computer and he'd always find them and delete them (asshole). Once I got my own computer, though, I had a field day. After a few months, I collected all of them. As <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> was released, it was always an adventure trying to find where the b-sides would first leak. Sometimes someone posts them on a website. Sometimes I find them on WinMX&#8212;who knows.</p><p>Over the years, I have to say the strongest b-sides came from the first album, <em>Garbage</em>. I know that batch is the band's favorite bunch. The band has even released some of these b-sides on their own singles. &quot;Sleep,&quot; &quot;#1 Crush,&quot; and &quot;Subhuman&quot; were given their own singles. My favorite b-side, &quot;Trip My Wire&quot; (which I actually heard for a first time on someone's website splash page), came from the first album.</p><p><em>Version 2.0</em> has a good variety of songs. I adore &quot;Deadwood,&quot; but I've actually heard that the band really hates the song. What the hell, why?! Anything that has Shirley hiding secret lyrics in it has to be gold. Most of these b-sides are alot &quot;poppier&quot; than the album, which is odd. &quot;Get Busy with the Fizzy&quot; is really obnoxious, but proto-<em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, which is interesting. Also, I have to make a shout-out to &quot;13x Forever,&quot; which is just one of those songs that motivates you to get of your ass and start kicking some.</p><p><em>Beautifulgarbage</em> had an eclectic bunch of b-sides. Like I mentioned, very experimental, and overwritten too. The band actually admitted recently that &quot;Untouchable&quot;&#8212;an album track&#8212;was intended to be a b-side, but the label executives liked it so much, they insisted it be on the album. I liked &quot;Enough is Never Enough&quot; when it first hit. It's one of those songs you go downtown to dance to. It's just too bad nobody will ever play it!</p><p>So far, they've only released two b-sides for <em>Bleed Like Me</em>: &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; and &quot;Nobody Can Win.&quot; I think that &quot;Nobody Can Win&quot; is quite obviously overwritten, but it's a nice acoustic piece. &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; really rocks, but it's too short. The band admitted that &quot;Why Don't You Come Over&quot; had many b-side qualities, but it had a popular following with people close to the band, so they included it on the album. It does have that quality about it that suggests it's not &quot;album-worthy,&quot; but who can be the judge, really.</p><p>Basically, if this post does anything, it should encourage you to check out some of the lesser known joys of your favorite band's music. I'm sure even the most notorious entertainers have an unreleased track that you've never heard that might tantalize your palate. Who knows?? Just be sure to check it out. Don't die wondering...</p><hr align="center" color="FFFAFA" width="50%" noshade><br><p>So that's it. Garbage week has come to an end. I just want to point out, before I bring this fabulous week to a conclusion, you should have seen this coming. I totally <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/spring04/6-06-04journal.html" target="_blank">mentioned it before</a>.</p><p>Anyways, I might have to take a break from all this uber-Blogging for a while, but expect more of the same very soon. And if you haven't picked up <em>Bleed Like Me</em>...well, I'm going to have to kick your ass.</p><p>And I'm so sorry I had to kick your ass. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Trippin'</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=32','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Trip My Wire </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/garbageweekicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Well, nearly 24 hours after I entered the Tabernacle, my ears are still buzzing. The show was awesome! It was so awesome seeing garbage play live! They put on a great show, and Shirley was absolutely stunning.  She's just so beautiful, there's no doubt about that.<p>I went along with my sister and we ate at Lee's Golden Buddha before heading down to the Tabernacle. She had an amaretto sour and I had some Merlot and Pino Gregio, which got us all buzzed for the show. I was really anxious about getting a good spot, but thankfully, there are plenty of them at the Tabernacle, so Jen and I kicked up our feet upstairs during the opening, which was a band called the Dead 60's.</p><p>They were alright, I couldn't really hear what the lead singer was saying, but whatever. Afterward, when we were waiting for garbage to come on, Jen and I saw them come out from backstage. She told me to go talk to them, but what was I going to say? &quot;Thank you for not playing so long, I couldn't hear you anyways.&quot;</p><p>I must confess, there was some pre-show nastiness that occurred with this&#8212;well, I want to use a filthy word, but after some contemplation, I have decided not to even dignify it and just forget about it. Basically, it ruined the show for Jen, and I was really bitter about it to. Some people just don't have pit hospitality. I just hope Duke threw his guitar pick into her eye.</p><p>They opened with some cover by the NIN of Johnny Cash. After that they ripped into &quot;Queer&quot; and &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; after that. I enjoyed &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; probably the most of any of the songs. It was funny because Shirley started to sing some lyrics early before the guitars cresendoed, and I could see Duke look at her when she realized what she did. She just shrugged and they played through it. Not many people probably caught that.</p><p>&quot;Hammering in my Head&quot; went really well. They did the same song at Music Midtown in 2002 with this cool intro which may have been there this time too. I wonder why they come back to that song so much during the live shows? They even seemed apologetic during the encore when they insisted on playing &quot;Sex is not the Enemy,&quot; a new song. How many people in there have <em>really</em> heard &quot;Hammering in my Head&quot;? I just wish they'd have the same confidence for their newer songs, because they are really good.</p><p>They only played one song from <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, which was disappointing. I know some of their other sets have included &quot;Cherry Lips,&quot; that would have been alot of fun to hear on an encore. An interview I read today had Butch admitting that he sees the new album as getting over the &quot;hangover&quot; that was <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, which was beginning promotion the exact same week as 9/11. I know the timing was tragic, but the album is still very good, and they should support it on the tour as much as they did all the others. That's probably my first complaint.</p><p>Anyways, &quot;Vow&quot; was awesome.  Shirley started that one talking about how amazing it is to be on tour over 10 years after that song was released. I saw them play the song at Music Midtown too, and it doesn't cease to be amazing. Being so close to Duke and Steve as they play those guitars&#8212;it's just amazing.</p><p>&quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; was dedicated to all us garbage fans. I really like that song, and they play it well live. I can't wait to see what they plan to do in a video. I just hope it's not corny.</p><p>They ended the main set with &quot;Why Do You Love Me,&quot; which rocked. They came back for the encore that followed really quickly, which was kind of weird, I thought. I guess they wanted to end the night alittle early.</p><p>During &quot;Sex is not the Enemy&quot;, Shirley stopped the show because a fan near the front appeared to lose consciousness. Oh, don't worry, that wasn't the case at all, they just lost their glasses. Shirley yelled back to Butch to cut the music as the pit crew helped whoever it was find their spectacles. It was funny watching Shirley go from concerned rock star to snickering Scot. She said, &quot;Did they find the glasses?&quot; laughing at us, and proceeded to recount how they had already stopped an earlier show for the same reason. She gave us all good advice, telling us not to forget to tie up our glasses with string before heading out to the garbage show. Fortunate for her, I was wearing contacts 8-)</p><p>After &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; (Jen's favorite of the evening), they closed the show with &quot;Right Between the Eyes,&quot; which I hear will be released in the UK as the next single there. I think it's alright, it's growing on me, but it doesn't touch &quot;Run Baby Run,&quot; which will be released in Europe next. I don't know why they aren't playing that one live. That would have made up for the nastiness from earlier in the evening if they had played it. Oh well.</p><p>Shirley left before the boys. It was cute, cause Butch came downstage, waved to the audience, and gave Duke a hug. God knows he was exhausted after drumming through &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; and &quot;Why Do You Love Me.&quot; It would have been nice to have another encore, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. I bought an expensive t-shirt, dropped Jen off at her car, and sped my way home.</p><p>I had a great time, garbage gave us an awesome performance. I guess the only problem I had was their lack of confidence in their newer music. I felt like they paraded all their best-selling singles before us when they probably could have played some of their most memorable songs like &quot;Parade&quot; or, God forbid, a b-side! Shirley even scoffed at the suggestion of playing &quot;Lick the Pavement,&quot; saying, &quot;We spent 2 and a half years on this record...we're going to play a new song and you're going to like it!&quot; That was cute, and the song was good, but couldn't they play something less recognizable in place of a song like &quot;Queer&quot;? I don't know, they did play &quot;Supervixen,&quot; which is cool, but I wish I could have gotten a more personal performance.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, it was awesome, better then most shows I've been to. Nothing could make garbage less than fabulous. I hope, if anyone else out there reading this went to the show, you enjoyed it as much as I did.</p><p>Anyways, I'll blog on b-sides tomorrow. After that, back to reality :'(</p><p align="center"><a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/yoshi369/album?.dir=2623&.src=ph&store=&prodid=&.done=http%3a//pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/yoshi369/my_photos" target="blank"><img src="garbage4-14.jpg"></a></p><p>Oh, yah, and for pictures of the show, don't forget to click the image above of sexy Shirl telling me that she's in love with me ;-)</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Scarred</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=31','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Bleed Like Me </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/bleedlikemeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I must say, this is pretty cool.  I've never been in a position to write a garbage review.  I must admit, I am a lousy garbage critic, because I love this band.  There's practically nothing that I don't have tremendous patience and understanding for when it comes to garbage. If they want to dump the technobabble and make a straight guitar album, I think I can take that.  I will admit, though, I had my reservations.<p>I already expounded my thoughts on &quot;<a href="2005/02/why-do-you-love-me.html">Why Do You Love Me.</a>&quot; It's a fun song, and now that I've had a few weeks to listen to it over and over again, I think it truly is a return more to the &quot;Push It&quot; type single garbage released with <em>Garbage</em> and <em>Version 2.0</em>: high energy and thrilling. It's just fun, and light on the &quot;darkness,&quot; per se.</p><p>The album as a whole, at least now, seems to conform to a style alot more readily than the previous 3. With <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, it always seemed like a few songs  echoed the albums that came before it. For example, &quot;Silence is Golden,&quot; at the time, sounded very much like <em>Garbage</em> (which is funny, because now it sounds almost proto-<em>Bleed Like Me</em>; almost like garbage's sound has come full circle).</p><p>There are very few songs on the album that call back to the past. &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; has a bit of <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> in it. &quot;It's All Over But The Crying&quot; is probably a distant cousin of <em>Version 2.0</em>. All the others, though patently garbage, ascribe to this new fourth sound that can only be called <em>Bleed Like Me</em>. Mad props for that, guys.</p><p>The downside to that, though, is what stands out with this new sound? Drums and guitar sound an awful lot like any other mediocre rock album out there, right? That's difficult to answer. I think just because garbage has chosen to ascribe itself to an easily distinguishable genre as opposed to the mixed bag we're all used to sticking them in doesn't mean they've given up on being the garbage we all know and love. After all, they're all over those drums and guitars when they play live, and we don't snicker then, do we? I guess I'm saying that the best way to see this album is to look at the forest for the trees.</p><p>Butch Vig says that starting this album with &quot;Bad Boyfriend&quot; is a &quot;milestone&quot; in the career of garbage. I think it's a solid song&#8212;much more so than <em>Beautifulgarbage</em>'s &quot;Shut Your Mouth.&quot; I expected something faster, but I'm satisfied with what we've got here. I don't notice the drums as much as they made me think I would. There is that part toward the end where Dave Grohl tears it up, but I would say it's not as impressive as Vig on &quot;Parade.&quot;</p><p>The likely second single &quot;Bleed Like Me&quot; is possibly the strongest lyrically that garbage has ever produced. It's fresh and really serves to capture the mood of the album as a whole. It seems to suggest, as it's the first album to be named to after a track, that the band is really running on all four cylinders creatively. The sound is more succinct. The category more defined. The experiment is (perhaps sadly) over.</p><p><em>Rolling Stone</em> says the album loses steam toward the last third. I must admit I felt things slowing down more toward the middle, but on second listen, I think I may come to appreciate &quot;Metal Heart&quot; and &quot;It's All Over But The Crying.&quot; I guess the problem alot of traditional garbage fans may have with these songs is the lack of distinguishing characteristics between each song. For example, the difference between &quot;Silence is Golden&quot; and &quot;Cherry Lips&quot; on <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> is like night and day. But again, maybe the differences on <em>Bleed Like Me</em> are more subtle. This is something I'll have to ponder.</p><p>I thought &quot;Why Don't You Come Over&quot; would be my favorite, but it was alright. Good intro to &quot;Happy Home,&quot; which again displays the lyrical maturity of songs like &quot;Bleed Like Me.&quot; It's haunting and atmospheric like &quot;So Like a Rose,&quot; but also remarkably fresh. I can understand the whole reflection on just how difficult the album was to make and this song representing the strength the band found to pull it together. Nicely done.</p><p>Now to brass tacks. &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; is by far my favorite track on the album. It's got the slimmed down sound, but it's still got a hint of that traditional garbage sound. I mean, after taking one look at the album credits and browsing the band's various roles, you have to wonder why Steve's still doing &quot;noises&quot; and &quot;programming&quot; and Duke's still into &quot;atmospherics.&quot; Tracks like &quot;Run Baby Run&quot; remind us that the same garbage we all know and love is still there, you just have to know where to look.</p><p>All and all, I must say I enjoyed sitting on the 4th floor of the SLC around 9:15 this morning listening to <em>Bleed Like Me</em> from beginning to end on my dying iPod. Saving myself for it was the right thing to do (though I regret reading along with the lyrics; it really should have been a raw listen). I think that this is exactly the album we've been waiting for. It's different enough to perplex and confound us. It's memorable and progressive. It might not change the world, but it's a whole new chapter for garbage fans everywhere.</p><p>But, come on! If you're disappointed, hopefully there's some strange b-side coming down the pipe. At least you have that to look forward to, right?</p><p>Ok, expect my account of the garbage concert this Thursday to appear sometime Friday (with pictures, I hope). Hopefully I'll see you at the show!</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Almost Free</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=30','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Run Baby Run</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/beautifulgarbageicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />By the time I had made it to college, I was well on my way to being a bone fide garbage freak.  I couldn't wait to listen to the first studio album since I had been a fan of the band. At UGA, I had the luxury of a high speed internet connection.  In the months before <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> was released, I soaked up every piece of information on the forthcoming album. Studio diaries, album cover scans, 30 second clips&#8212;you name it, I knew about it, I had it on my hard drive.<p>I downloaded &quot;Androgyny&quot; first as a radio rip when I was at home visiting. I didn't like it very much. I mean, it's not horrible, it was just so different&#8212;I had expected something more rock and less pop. The video came out with mediocre fanfare (possible due to the nation-wide depression brought about by 9/11). I thought it was sexy, but Shirley was certainly going places with her style that most fans were not comfortable with. I dug it though. Better that they made this <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> and not<em> Version 3.0</em>.</p><p>I thought <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> was going to change the world! I had this crazy idea that after toiling months in a cramped studio in Madison WI, garbage would emerge and silence the cacophony of Christina Aguilera (whom Shirley famously referred to in her studio diary as a cunt) and Britney Spears. I couldn't wait until October 2nd, I had to have my revolution now!</p><p>The album had leaked, of course. I was bored one night in Russell Hall with high speed Internet&#8212;so yah. I did it. I started with &quot;So Like a Rose,&quot; which I assumed would be moody like <em>Version 2.0</em>'s concluding track. It was pretty good. It always seemed alot more existential and mature than any other garbage song I'd heard. It didn't stop there, though. By the end of that week, I had downloaded every track.</p><p>&quot;Cherry Lips&quot; really stuck out on the album. I had heard a 30 second clip of it a week or two earlier, and I was instantly annoyed by it. Way too different and way too sugary. But, like most first impressions, there was more to be seen. That particular song, like the album as a whole, was exploding with  pop&#8212;but it was earned. The whole tuba through the wa-wa peddle was an excellent base for the song, and it had a way of crescendoing to that level of obnoxious pop that seemed natural and sustained. The album was able to achieve this very well.</p><p>On first listen, I really dug &quot;Drive You Home.&quot; I thought it was really sweet and endearing. It was stripped down&#8212;not many bells and whistles on that one. It took me a while to realize it was almost a ballad to the lover you keep but leave behind, like Shirley's husband Eddie.</p><p>&quot;Parade&quot; and &quot;Breaking Up The Girl&quot; were some of my favorite freshman year anthems. I remember romping home after getting an A on one of my English papers listening to &quot;Breaking Up The Girl.&quot; &quot;Parade&quot; was always my running song. Like most fans, I found &quot;Can't Cry These Tears&quot; and &quot;Till the Day I Die&quot; to be really annoying, but in retrospect, they're both special in their own ways.</p><p>My favorite song on the album had to be &quot;Cup of Coffee.&quot; It was one of the tracks that called back to the emotion of <em>Version 2.0</em>. The lyrics were bare, but very real. The melody and noises were noticeably haunting and strangely comforting. Though I didn't recognize it at first, this song became very special for me.</p><p>The album was not promoted well. I think alot of people missed out on a quality album, but granted, it came at a difficult time. Not even one month since 9/11. Regardless of any of that, I still think it's valuable. In the past 3 years, I've probably listened to it the most often of the 3 albums. It was always the most current, mature, and fun.</p><hr align="center" color="FFFAFA" width="50%" noshade><br><p>But not anymore. It's been a while since I've got a good dose of garbage. I suppose <em>Garbage</em>, <em>Version 2.0</em>, <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> and a cavalcade of b-sides just aren't enough anymore. After a difficult 2001-2002 tour and a brief break-up, garbage has released their 4th studio album: <em>Bleed Like Me</em>. Years of waiting are at an end.</p><p>Of course, if you want to see how that turns out&#8212;tune in tomorrow.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Obsessed</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=29','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Cup of Coffee </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 Version 2.0
	 
    </h3>

      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/version2.0icon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />The first garbage album I ever bought was <em>Version 2.0</em>. I was an obnoxious teenager with a part-time job and lots of money to burn. I was browsing the new release wall at Media Play and I remember picking up the album and considered buying it.  I had heard a steady stream of hits already from the album, so it seemed like a good investment.  I had no idea.<p>At first, like all the albums I owned, I only listened to the popular singles. &quot;Push It&quot;, &quot;I Think I'm Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Special&quot; and &quot;When I Grow Up&quot; were all played often on my Mazda's CD player. I didn't really have a particular favorite, though. It was pop music! Nothing out of the ordinary.</p><p>Jen's good friend Emily suggested that I listen to one of her favorite songs on the album, &quot;Sleep Together.&quot; I realize it's not one of the band's best songs, but it opened for me a world I had never been before. I really liked to song, and I guess I got sick of clicking the back button on my CD player, so I just kept listening.</p><p>I became notorious for this album. I listened to nothing else in my car, whether I was driving to school or work, I had this album on. I played it so much, that to this day my sister still recognizes every song&#8212;and even sings along!</p><p>The songs on this album really don't stand out as strongly as the songs on <em>Garbage</em> did. <em>Version 2.0</em> was always more of a package to me. There's something about the way the album begins with &quot;Temptation Waits&quot; and just sends you into the stratosphere. The whole album blended so many different styles of music and wove them together so beautifully. Disco, pop, country, rock, folk&#8212;all of it was there. Shirley Manson also produced some of the most touching lyrics I have ever heard.</p><p>One thing that always bugged me was my originial association for the song "I Think I'm Paranoid." I would listen to the album&#8212;particularly that song&#8212;when I was working at Kroger and I was on my break. I remember listening to the song while eating Baked Lays. For the longest time, I couldn't get that strange connection out of my head everytime I heard the song. It would be a shame to hate the song based solely on the fact that it recalled miserable days at Kroger.</p><p>I remember blairing &quot;Medication&quot; out of my car's stereo the day I came home and saw that my dad bought my sister a really nice used car, passing me up in my shitmobile, making me feel absolutely worthless. I listened to the lyrics, &quot;Nobody gives a damn about me / Or anybody else&quot; as I drove to the gym and just ran my frustrations and pain away.</p><p>I really experienced &quot;You Look So Fine&quot; for the first time one day waiting in the car outside of Kroger. My sister had to run in for something and I sat outside, on a drizzly day, with my window rolled down. I had the music low&#8212;it was hypnotising. The lyrics were the most profound, emotional, and bare that I have ever heard. There's not one thing wrong with that song, it's absolutely perfect. I return to it every single time I feel dejected and alone. It personifies love&#8212;a perfectly obsessive, yet unrequited love, that achieves nothing but pain.</p><p>After the sublime experience of <em>Version 2.0</em>, I wanted more. I picked up <em>Garbage</em>, as I have already explained, but it wasn't enough. I frequented the website, read the studio journals, anxiously awaiting the band's third album...</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Knocked Down</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=28','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>You Look So Fine</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

	 Garbage
	 
    </h3>
    
	         <div class="post-body">
	<div>
      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/garbageicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />The first garbage album was released in 1995.  I was 12 years old&#8212;far too young to care, sadly.  I  didn't buy the album when it came out.  I wasn't fortunate enough  to get that first single &quot;Vow&quot; in its legendary metal casing.  I was just a sniveling brat kid, so I missed out.</p><p>What I do remember, though, is hearing the music. Though it wasn't released on the album, &quot;#1 Crush&quot; on the <em>Romeo + Juliet</em> soundtrack really made waves with me. I remember turning the volume up in my room and bobbing my head to that song. I was living in Boca Raton at the time. I also recall hearing &quot;Stupid Girl,&quot; probably the most recognizable song from the album. That song was notorious for me, particularly, because everytime it came on the radio I would belt out the chorus sarcastically toward my sister. Oh, yeah, she appreciated that.</p><p>Though I'm sure I heard &quot;Only Happy When it Rains,&quot; I don't remember it ever resonating with me way back then. I just wasn't that into the alternative scene. My debut-album abstinence ended around the fall of 1999, though. I had fallen so very hard for <em>Version 2.0</em> and had really gotten into garbage. And as the legend goes, I was watching some crappy MTV game show Webriot when the video for &quot;Only Happy When It Rains&quot; came on. Suddenly, I was hooked. I went out the next day and got the album.</p><p>Needless to say, it rocked. It took me a while to give the album a decent chance, though. I had it ingrained in my head that album tracks that weren't singles were worse than dirt, and I never listened to them. That changed, thankfully.  I remember listening to &quot;Fix Me Now&quot; around the time I was making my last ditch effort to be straight. I was trying to take this girl Audrey to my Junior prom. When I was driving to her house to pick her up on what could only be considered a lame attempt to court her, I started listening to the song. I guess you could say it had some &quot;special significance,&quot; as I hoped she could &quot;fix&quot; those darned homosexual urges. Needless to say, <em>that</em> didn't work.</p><p>I also really got into &quot;Stroke of Luck.&quot; It's still one of my favorite songs off the album to this day. It's one of those songs that I'd listen to while driving home from work at Target down those lonely roads in Kennesaw. God knows the song's a downer, but we all need a good kick in the gut every now and then. </p><p>I got really into &quot;Vow&quot; during my trip to Europe in the spring of 2000. I picked up the special edition of <em>Version 2.0</em> in London, and it came with this nifty 4 track bonus disk of garbage playing live at the 1998 Roskilde Festival. The disk ended with just about the most high-energy version of &quot;Vow&quot; I had ever heard, and it still rocks my socks off to this day. I listen to that song when I feel so beaten and alone and need motivation to get my ass off the floor and put up a fight. The album track rocks too, though. It sounds so disgusting and trashy, but it just comes together so beautifully by the end.</p><p>Nowadays, I listen to <em>Garbage</em> when I feel depressed. It's dark enough to accompany such moods, but it's uplifting in the sense that you know things are going to get better. It's not my favorite album, probably my least favorite. The sound is unique and outstanding, but undeveloped.</p><p>Fortunately, garbage's seconds helping, <em>Version 2.0</em>, took the moody electic-alternative rifts to a whole new world.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Vengeful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=27','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Vow</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
