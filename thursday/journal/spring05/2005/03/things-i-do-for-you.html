I wasn't going to let myself go on without finishing up my stuff for Marilia. I can be so worthless sometimes. Though, I'll tell you, sitting in front of the computer for an hour cropping pictures and editing HTML gets kind of boring. Trust me.<p>Highlights of the past week and a half include me finishing that silly Chaucer paper. Like all of my papers, I feel I could have done better. I think my argument was kind of simple, I should have been more specific. I should be less of a pussy. Maybe I should have worked on it alittle bit longer than I did, but oh well. One down, <em>only</em> one to go.</p><p>My mother also got me a bed frame. This has revolutionized my room, as I am now without this depressing sunken mattress and box spring in the center of my room. Granted, it still takes up most of the room, but at least now it looks alot classier. I should probably do some laundry today. Then my room will look just about spotless.</p><p>I have been running like a madman lately. In the past two weeks, I have run over 12 miles each week. I do these 4 mile circuits around Athens on Mondays and Wednesday, and then depending on my mood, again on either Friday or Saturday. It's a very difficult circuit, but I've been able to complete it without too much trouble each day. Genevieve would be really proud. The circuit ends right between the intersection at the Hill Hall and Tate parking lots and the intersection at Cedar St. near O-house. It's a really nasty hill, and I sprint up it every time. It's incredibly draining, but I finish it everytime. It's one of the many things I do.</p><p>Though Friday was a bit troubling. I had planned on doing my run and then go to the gym, but I felt so strange after I was done. I felt very itchy, it was extremely odd. Jeremy said it might have been because I was dehydrated. It's possible, I had run the night before nearly 3.5 miles. I guess next week, I'll try not to overdo it.</p><p>As for today, I'm taking a break. Just a light workout this morning, and a lazy afternoon.</p><p>Last night, I went to Caledonia Lounge with Laura. We saw a band called the Slippery People, who do cover songs of the Talking Heads. I didn't know many Talking Heads songs, but the band turned out to be really cool. Laura's friend Adreana was one of the singers, and Missy's infamous &quot;Inside Mary Lyndon&quot; was the lead singer. That was really kind of neat to see. It would have been nice getting liquored up and heading to Krush Girls, but I guess there are more important things to do. I love hanging out with my Laura.</p><p>As for getting liquored up, perhaps I can do that tonight. We'll see what people are doing.</p><p>I'm going to take a nap. Adios.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Spent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=17','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Rob Duncan - <em>The Final Fight (from 'Chosen')</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
