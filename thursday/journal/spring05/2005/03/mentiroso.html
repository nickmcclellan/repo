      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/darkkagomeicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Isn't all this rain nice? I was so impressed that these thunderstorms have not come 'a thundering during the most inopportune times&#8212;by that I mean when I'm riding my bike between classes. That would be unfortunate. Luckily, I'm through with all the necessary biking for this week at least. I just have one more 6 mile run before I can kick my feet up, as they say, and watch the rain fall. I had such a pleasant run last Saturday, I will hopefully repeat it this weekend.<p>But necessary sunshine aside, it was nice to wake up to the sound of thunder this morning. That's not something that happens every day.</p><p>Yesterday was pretty busy. Full day of classes <em>and</em> there's was this pesky book for my Chaucer class that I was absolutely unable to locate. I mean, I haven't gone to Borders yet, but I doubt the <em>Book of Margery Kempe</em> is on their shelves. I was petrified of going to class yesterday. I skipped Monday because I didn't have time to find the book over the weekend, so I couldn't skip again. Ultimately, I risked embarassment at the feet of Shutters and braved the discussion taking extensive, involved notes on virtually every aspect of the class (most notably Shutters's inabilty to form a sentence and my odd craving for egg rolls. By the way, are those vegetarian?)</p><p>Things worked out though. I went running in the afternoon. It was just right, and on a liberating and strange note, I was compelled to run shirtless. Who goes driving down the tawdry backroads by Cedar Shoals anyways? Plus, my very pale flesh could use some rays. It was kind of nice. Almost like some lost high school dream come true. I can run shirtless and not be embarassed or ashamed. Go me :-)</p><p>I also taught sans Diane last night. Only two students showed up, which was incredibly depressing since I had planned an activity requiring eight people. I did teach them the word &quot;lemonade&quot; and also explained what the verb &quot;to cheat&quot; means.</p><p> &quot;<em>Mentir!</em>&quot; they said to me, as if the bewitching fog that is English was permeable for the moment. </p><p>&quot;Yes, <em>como mentiroso</em>," I said to them. "Like a liar.&quot;</p><p>Also, in addition to <em>Bleed Like Me</em>, which I will be adding to my garbage album collection very soon, I am looking forward to the new New Order album. I don't have any of their albums, sadly, but I'm looking for <em>Get Ready</em>, but I haven't found it yet (I haven't looked very hard though). Maybe my new found appreciation for all things New Order will evolve into a Flaming Lips-like behavior in which I purchase  every album beginning with the most recent. With the 'Lips, I'm currently at <em>The Soft Bulletin</em>. Now, which album came before that??</p><p>Anyways, this is becoming long-winded. I should go to my boring composition class. You know, someone might cough. I could miss that.</p><p>Later.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Resigned</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=23','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">New Order - <em>Krafty</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
