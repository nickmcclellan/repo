      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/rainbowinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />What am I supposed to say?  I don't really know.  I was almost compelled Tuesday to say something.  I even made this flashy new icon and everything.  Nothing came out though.  I just sort of settled down on the concrete like some forgotten autumn leaf in spring.  But, let's not forget, what was neglected and ignored yesterday&#8212;when we needed it the most&#8212;is something different and unseeming today.  It's almost as if I wasn't angry at all.  Or hurt.  Or in desperate need.<p>I just feel now so forgotten.  I don't know if it would be worse otherwise. All I have this heavy burden of considering that it just doesn't matter. It's not like that changes anything, it's not like I'm still not strong or that I won't try. It's just, what does it take exactly? When are you desperate enough for something truly incredible? Does it just happen to you, like a missed bus or a rainy day, or do you earn it? Is it possible to do just enough to deserve it? I don't know. But enough of that.  That was yesterday, this is today.</p><p>Last night, I went out with John Lynch. It's so nice having him in town. I miss people like him. We got to have dinner and wine with Ben, and we went to Room Thirteen by Clocked. I had many alcoholic beverages, but I wasn't drunk.  It was the first time I have had alcohol in a long time. I wasn't missing much.</p><p>And I wasn't missing much by abstaining from Boneshakers this semester. What a stank hole. There was barely anyone there, except for Kyle. There's always that one old fat guy who's balding and walks around hugging all the younger guys who always sends this strange leading stare at me. I swear to God, if he touched me, I would have decked him. I just don't like that place anymore.</p><p>By the way, I downloaded Firefox this week, and I noticed my website looks like complete shit in it. Please, I know you pretentious Firefox users <em>love</em> your bug-free browser, but don't judge my design abilities from what you see in it. Take a look at the site in Internet Explorer. I promise, it will be worth the beauteous look at the face of God (well, maybe not that good).</p><p>I ran 6 miles today, so I'm going to lay down and maybe munch on some Easter candy my mother sent me. I'll maybe write some more tonight. Almost done, so good for me.</p><p>I'll try to Blog tomorrow&#8212;just to give this week some symmetry. Yay for that.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Exhausted</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=6','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Cure - <em>Lovesong</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
