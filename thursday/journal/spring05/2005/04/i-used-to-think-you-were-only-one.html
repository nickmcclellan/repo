      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/bsidesicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I never knew what a b-side was, did you?  It wasn't until one day, I was driving around Kennesaw and decided to go to Media Play and browse the garbage section, looking for something interesting.  I saw a single to &quot;I Think I'm Paranoid&quot; that came with two unreleased tracks:  &quot;Deadwood&quot; and &quot;Afterglow.&quot;  What was this, I thought I had heard every garbage song?!  I very quickly bought the pricey import and stuffed in my car's CD player, hearing a garbage b-side for the first time.<p>Basically, any good band will make as many as 25 songs for an album. Obviously, some are better than others. With every garbage album, the band has released about 8 b-sides, on average. Some of them are really good. I'm sure everyone's heard &quot;#1 Crush,&quot; from the <em>Romeo + Juliet</em> soundtrack. That was actually a remix of a b-side. There are also b-sides that are good, but really undeveloped compared to the album tracks. For example, the recent b-side &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; is really good musically, but it sounds like it needs another verse or something. Also, alot of fans really loved &quot;Use Me,&quot; but I always thought it was overwritten.</p><p>Then, at least how I see it, there's always one or two b-sides that are so bizarre and experimental, they could never be on a garbage album because the world just isn't ready. &quot;Alien Sex Fiend&quot; is a prime example&#8212;what's going on there?? I remember when I heard &quot;Tornado,&quot; from <em>Version 2.0</em>, for the first time, I hated it so much. Since then, I've grown to appreciate how much it truly rocks. <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> had many of these experimental songs. &quot;Happiness Pt. 2&quot; was probably alittle too strange, and &quot;I'm Really Into Techno&quot; was cool because it's the only garbage song that Shirley doesn't sing on. Personally, &quot;Confidence&quot; was always my favorite. It's got that cool noise in it, and Shirley's all deep throated. It rocks.</p><p>Once I realized buying each import single was going to be too expensive, I began to collect b-sides over the Internet. I'd download them onto my father's computer and he'd always find them and delete them (asshole). Once I got my own computer, though, I had a field day. After a few months, I collected all of them. As <em>Beautifulgarbage</em> was released, it was always an adventure trying to find where the b-sides would first leak. Sometimes someone posts them on a website. Sometimes I find them on WinMX&#8212;who knows.</p><p>Over the years, I have to say the strongest b-sides came from the first album, <em>Garbage</em>. I know that batch is the band's favorite bunch. The band has even released some of these b-sides on their own singles. &quot;Sleep,&quot; &quot;#1 Crush,&quot; and &quot;Subhuman&quot; were given their own singles. My favorite b-side, &quot;Trip My Wire&quot; (which I actually heard for a first time on someone's website splash page), came from the first album.</p><p><em>Version 2.0</em> has a good variety of songs. I adore &quot;Deadwood,&quot; but I've actually heard that the band really hates the song. What the hell, why?! Anything that has Shirley hiding secret lyrics in it has to be gold. Most of these b-sides are alot &quot;poppier&quot; than the album, which is odd. &quot;Get Busy with the Fizzy&quot; is really obnoxious, but proto-<em>Beautifulgarbage</em>, which is interesting. Also, I have to make a shout-out to &quot;13x Forever,&quot; which is just one of those songs that motivates you to get of your ass and start kicking some.</p><p><em>Beautifulgarbage</em> had an eclectic bunch of b-sides. Like I mentioned, very experimental, and overwritten too. The band actually admitted recently that &quot;Untouchable&quot;&#8212;an album track&#8212;was intended to be a b-side, but the label executives liked it so much, they insisted it be on the album. I liked &quot;Enough is Never Enough&quot; when it first hit. It's one of those songs you go downtown to dance to. It's just too bad nobody will ever play it!</p><p>So far, they've only released two b-sides for <em>Bleed Like Me</em>: &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; and &quot;Nobody Can Win.&quot; I think that &quot;Nobody Can Win&quot; is quite obviously overwritten, but it's a nice acoustic piece. &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; really rocks, but it's too short. The band admitted that &quot;Why Don't You Come Over&quot; had many b-side qualities, but it had a popular following with people close to the band, so they included it on the album. It does have that quality about it that suggests it's not &quot;album-worthy,&quot; but who can be the judge, really.</p><p>Basically, if this post does anything, it should encourage you to check out some of the lesser known joys of your favorite band's music. I'm sure even the most notorious entertainers have an unreleased track that you've never heard that might tantalize your palate. Who knows?? Just be sure to check it out. Don't die wondering...</p><hr align="center" color="FFFAFA" width="50%" noshade><br><p>So that's it. Garbage week has come to an end. I just want to point out, before I bring this fabulous week to a conclusion, you should have seen this coming. I totally <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/spring04/6-06-04journal.html" target="_blank">mentioned it before</a>.</p><p>Anyways, I might have to take a break from all this uber-Blogging for a while, but expect more of the same very soon. And if you haven't picked up <em>Bleed Like Me</em>...well, I'm going to have to kick your ass.</p><p>And I'm so sorry I had to kick your ass. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Trippin'</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=32','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Trip My Wire </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
