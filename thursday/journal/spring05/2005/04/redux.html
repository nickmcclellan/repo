It is unfortunate, I must admit that Blogging was never more fun.  I know, I know, it was probably the most uninteresting, drab, and overwritten week I've ever produced, but I loved it.  It's something I can look back on and smile about.  Heck, that's the whole fucking website, right?  I revel in the useless and forgotten!<p>Anyways, in the aftermath of the new garbage album, I find I can't listen to anything else. I knew this was going to happen. I think I'll separate myself from <em>Bleed Like Me</em> enough to run my 6 miles with a smart playlist on my iPod or something. I mean, if a garbage song just randomly pops in there, it's not my fault, right? I went looking for New Order's <em>Waiting for the Siren's Call</em> on Saturday because I saw it was released on iTunes, but apparently the CD isn't released until next week. What's up with that? I mean, mp3's are great and all, but I prefer to rip, not download. It just feels so much cooler.</p><p>Well, I wanted to go into some of the most interesting points of last week. It was pretty cool afterall. Tuesday was really long. I got up early to get the garbage album and I had my resume looked at one more time. I want to send it out to five jobs I found over the weekend. I'm aiming for locales far from Georgia because I quite honestly can't stand it here. I want to go some place different where I can start my career but also where I don't have to feel cut off from the world. I certainly don't want to spend anymore time in Athens, that's for sure.</p><p>On Wednesday, I went to yet another exhaustive day of class. I went up in weight, at least. Can you believe I'm benching 125?? Maybe no one knows what that means, and even if you did, you'd know it wasn't much. I've come a long way since the beginning of the semester, and that's something to be proud of.</p><p>Also, the running is going along really well. Another 6 miles Wednesday, but something very interesting happened. I <em>thought</em> the ominous storm on the radar would just slink on by north of me, but that didn't happen. About three miles from my house, I noticed in the distance what looked like large and heavy droplets of rain. As we all know, it turned out to be hail. I mean, you have to picture this. There I am, in the midst of some nasty downpour of hail protecting my iPod, cowering under a tree shirtless and wishing I hadn't been such a bonehead and stayed home to be lazy. A nice couple came to my rescue and invited me into their home and gave me a towel to dry off. They were really cool. After the storm subsided, I was off and running again, faster than usual. I wanted to get home out of the further threat of nastiness, ASAP.</p><p>I talked to Laura Wednesday when my sister and I were out to dinner at this restaurant called Maggiano's. She told me the picture she took of me for her thesis was chosen to be represented as part of the best work from the school. Apparently, I'm known as the hot guy from Georgia to the girls and boys at Ringling in Sarasota. Just incase you haven't seen the finished product over on my facebook, here it is. Trust me, if there was any magic at all, it came from my cousin, not me. </p><p align="center"><img src="thesis.jpg"></p><p>Friday I just got drunk with Jerm and Padmini and regaled them with my fabulous cable. I promise it will be my last tryst with Everclear. The bottle's empty. The party's over. Just a note, though: I just love Padmini. There's a reason she's on the top row of the Friends Page.</p><p>Anyways, hopefully sleep will help me to forget that I have one more day to deal with. By this time next week, things have to be different. That would be sublime.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Aching</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=33','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Boys Wanna Fight </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
