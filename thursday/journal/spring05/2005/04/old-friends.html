      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/bleedshirlicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Before I start plugging away on the last paper of my undergraduate experience here at UGA, I just want to go into what happened Saturday.  It was a truly special day.<p>Well, I woke up alittle later than I had hoped. I wanted to get out the door running by 9 or 10 a.m., but that turned out to be more around 10:20. I find it really hard to start running in the morning, especially when it's the first thing I do all day. Who's to say I have the physical strength to eclipse six miles that early in the morning? Well, eventually I started going at it.</p><p>It was an uneventful run. Disappointing in only one sense: lately, I have been allowing myself to walk. No, not like I used to walk a substantial portion of the circuit when I had run in the past, nothing like that. I just stop somewhere briefly, for maybe 50 paces, and walk. It's always a let down for me. I wish I had the strength to run the whole thing every time.</p><p>Someone did yell out their car at me. I don't even know what they said, but I was surprised how much it didn't bother me. I noticed that people do stupid stuff like that when I started riding my bike home from school. Some people can't help but to honk and yell at you to humiliate you. I don't know why anyone would do something like that. I thought about it alot, then finished my run with an extra sprint to my door to make up for those 50 paces.</p><p>After that, I was off to Marietta as fast as I could to see Nicole. She was having a cookout, like I mentioned, and I wanted to get there early so I could have some one-on-one time with her. I really do consider her one of my best friends, and I wanted a chance to connect with her personally. It was probably stupid, but it turned out well.</p><p>I went straight to her house and as soon as I saw her, I gave her a big hug. I shook her brother Conrad's hand. He'd definitely beefed up since the last time I saw him. Nicole's parents were really funny. They kept asking how I had been and I told them I'd be graduating in a three weeks. They'd get all suggestive to Nicole at that point, saying to me, &quot;Wow, graduating in <em>four years</em>, that really great!&quot; They enjoy giving their daughter a hard time about her choice to go to a law school in France, but she's sure she made the right decision. It's certainly made her happy, that's for sure.</p><p>Nicole and I ducked out long enough to take a stroll through he McEachern campus. It hasn't changed much. There's many more vending machines and recycling bins, which is both good and bad. It looks alot smaller, though. I guess Nicole and I, at some point, outgrew this place. It can't hold us anymore.</p><p>We went back for the food part of the cookout, and April showed up. I insisted on veggie burgers, and the Levesque clan suddenly started a vein of conversation on vegetarianism, which didn't turn out so bad. I think alot of people liked the veggie burgers. Nicole's grandmother kept asking what they were made out of.</p><p>After the family fun, we decided to go out and get a drink. We went down another walk down memory lane&#8212;at least for me. It was the first time I had been to my old Taco Mac since I lasted worked there. No one recognized me at all, which was alright. We had a very pricey pitcher of margaritas and Nicole had a Sweet Georgia Brown. I promised her when I went to see her in Angers this summer I'd try beer. For the first time.</p><p>April had a Mudslide which really turned out to be a fancy name for an alcoholic milkshake. Interesting concept&#8212;Nicole even recalled the days back at McEachern when I used to dip my french fries in my milkshakes at school. Even I had forgot I started that strange habit with her. Anyways, we didn't dip french fries in April's mudslide. We got alittle smashed, praised our server, and moved the party back to my house.</p><p>Jen got us some spirits and we continued there. Nicole got really drunk and frisky. There was some nominal kissing. I only mention this because I know Nicole's boyfriend Alain doesn't know a lick of English. She was tired, so April took her home. I gave her a big hug, told her I loved her, and that I'd be coming to see her very soon. Far, far away from here.</p><p>I didn't want to stay in Marietta, so I had numerous glasses of water to wash the Hurricanes and Amaretto Sours from my system. I had so much water that before I left my sister's house I think I peed like 3 times. I even had to stop at the QuikTrip on 316 to use the bathroom, I was about the explode. I never stop to use the bathroom. And I always thought I had the strongest of bladders.</p><p>One freak occurrence though, I was wearily cruising at 75 mph about to get on the loop when a cop ahead of me in the medium flashed his lights on quickly and turned them off. It shocked me completely awake. I got down to 55 mph so fast, I don't think he had the heart to pull me over. I thought I was a goner for sure. I arrived home safely, so don't worry.</p><p>So that was Saturday. Now it's Sunday and I have so many things to finish. Maybe at the end of <em>this</em> week, things will be different. We will certainly see.</p><blockquote><i>In my happy home I barely breathe<br>I never once in my wayward life was heading to run out</i></blockquote><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Weary</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=34','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Happy Home </em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
