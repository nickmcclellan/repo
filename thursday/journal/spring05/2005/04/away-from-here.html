      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/kakikyoicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />Well, there's good news and bad news.<p>Good news first. I'm posting! It's not that I haven't wanted to post or anything. I guess I just wanted to put my website energies into something else. For one, I have finished recoding the entire site. I have no idea if it will make any difference, really. Basically, one stylesheet governs all non-Blog content. It just means whenever I decide to finish the website and want to convert some of those pages to the older themes, that's going to be a real sinch. Also, it sort of means if I ever wanted to update the site again, it would be extremely easy. Too bad that's not going to happen :-) </p><p>Also, I got 2 new garbage b-sides this week! I haven't got a new b-side since &quot;I Just Want to Have Something to do Tonight&quot; way back in 2003. They're called &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone&quot; and &quot;Nobody Can Win.&quot; I really like them! It's so nice listening to new garbage since I've restricted myself from previewing the new album that comes out Tuesday.</p><p>I really enjoy &quot;Space Can Come Through Anyone.&quot; I remember reading in Shirley Manson's Internet Journal about it. It really is a catchy song even if it's a bit short and somewhat incomplete. It compelled me to ride my bike home 4 times this week! Gee whiz, that's every day so far! Keen :-D </p><p>&quot;Nobody Can Win&quot; is alright, I suppose it may grow on me. Something about the lyrics that really turn me off. Oh well, I suppose there's some reason why they're b-sides, right?</p><p>Ok, the bad news. Next week is the release of the fourth garbage album. In observation of this very special time, I intend to Blog on nothing but garbage. On Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, I'm going to Blog on the first three garbage albums and all stuff involved with their obvious fabulousness. On Wednesday, once I've had ample time to listen to <em>Bleed Like Me</em> over and over again, I will dole out my first review. Then, after a break on Thursday to attend the garbage concert, on Friday I'll give my review of the show. For Saturday, I suppose I'll Blog about b-sides, just to give the week some closure. Sounds ambitious, but I think it will be so much fun! I'm so excited about next week. I so glad I've saved myself for the new album and will be hearing it for the first time Tuesday. My iPod will be singing nothing but garbage for some time to come, I'm sure.</p><p>Other than all that garbage, I've finished my resume and even ran it under Fink's nose. He asked me if I was gay today! It was funny. He also said that copy editors were in high demand, so I'm excited about that. Maybe I will be editing for some major metro paper after all. This weekend I'd like to start to set my sights on some jobs. That's really the only thing I need to do at this point. I have no idea where I want to go, I just know I don't want to be here.</p><p>Anyways, that's all I wanted to Blog for now. I will chime in before Sunday, so until then.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Waiting</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=25','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Snow Patrol - <em>Run</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
