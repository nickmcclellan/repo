      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/lilypissedicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I'm in alot of pain right now. Yes, it's considerable. On Wednesday, I had my normal load of <em>four classes straight</em>. Of course, I started my day in Gilbert Hall, and then I went to Fink in Journalism. This class rocks, of course, because Fink is a God and he knows all. After that, I had to trek on my bike all the way down to Ramsey for my very first day in lifting weights in beginners weight training. I was the weakling doing bicep curls with only the bar. After <em>that</em> I had to ride my battered body on my bike all the way back to North Campus (to Park Hall, to be exact) for my Women and Chaucer Class. I was listening to Lauryn Hill's &quot;The Conquering Lion&quot; when I was making the final approach up the hill, and it was rather ironic. When I got home that day, I felt like I wanted to fall over and die.<p>So I took a nap. It was delicious, as far as naps are concerned. I did some teacher training this week for CSS, and that turned out to be <em>cookie</em>licious. We played musical chairs, but I won, so that was good. It would have sucked to be the one in the middle that had to answer all the questions. I also bought a new backpack this week because the one I had couldn't hold my laptop. The one I've got now is all spacious, and computer friendly, which is nice.</p><p>Anyways, I'm still plugging away at those Friends Pages. After I'm finished with all that, I think I'll turn my attention to the Galleries Page, and then I'll start to write my semester Blogs. Not sure if I mentioned, but I want to do a special &quot;looking back&quot; Blog for each year I spent at UGA. They'll basically be set on the Archive page, featured with their respective semesters, so that people can get a bigger picture look at the experience without having to sift through all that crap. I may even go back and correct some HTML errors that are abounds, certainly. Oh, how I love endless updating...ahhh</p><p>So check out <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/friends/leena.html">Leena</a>'s page. She's been liberated from Dille, as I mentioned. I'm still waiting on Dille's photos, maybe I'll work on her page tomorrow.</p><p>Anyways, I hope everyone has a nice weekend. I know my weekend will be carefree (Senioritus prevents me from really caring about homework...and there's nothing anyone can do about it!)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
