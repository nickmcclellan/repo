      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/buffybrokenicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />The power just went out. I almost instinctively turned the song on. Could you blame me? It's all I think about in this room.<p>This story will become legend, as far as this website is concerned. It was during a blackout that Matt told me he was leaving me. During the biggest hurricane of 2004. I brought it up in <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/fall04/9-12-04journal.html">"Concession."</a> I'll bring it up in the Senior Blog. And, yeah, I'm bringing it up now.</p><p>I haven't Blogged about him once this semester. Well, that's not entirely true, but I hid that entry. It doesn't count. I thought I'd bring it up once more, at least, since his leaving has had such a profound impact on me. It's important that I be honest. If it really is supposed to end like this, then the only luxuries I can be afforded are my memories.</p><p>You might think that I don't remember. You might think that I have gotten over it entirely. And you might be right, I have come a long way and I intend to go further. So if I am still under this weather, than the storm is passing.</p><p>But that doesn't mean I don't think about him. It doesn't diminish the weight of the things I said and the love I had for him. And, to my dismay, it doesn't lessen the extent that I am confounded by his decision to leave me. He was my best friend and now he is a phantom. He is a collection of things I have put into a box which I am unwilling to tape shut.</p><p>I spent the semester preparing for the possibility that he would never speak to me again. I didn't think he was capable of it, and though I was wrong, I nonetheless anticipated his cruelty. The night that I decided I was ready to e-mail him, I felt something I did not expect: shame. Trying to talk to him after he did what he did to me cost me precious self-respect, something I did not have much to give. I cried for him over forgotten idols in an empty room hoping he would show me something more than vicious silence. I bit my lip and wiped the tears from my face, hoping that if I could defeat the demons he left behind with me, I could at least be his friend. If I could do that, I would at least have solace.</p><p>He didn't respond and I never asked why. I never tried again, though I promised myself I would. I won't though. I don't want to surrender anymore of my self-respect to him.</p><p>I'm terrified that I might see him. The thought of running into him makes my heart leap into my throat. I have never felt this way about anyone. To have to face him unprepared and completely out of the blue is the one thing God has kept from me, and for that I am thankful. I'm not ready for that, but one day, I hope I will be. If I am going to see him again, it will have to be on his terms.</p><p>You see, the one thing I learned in all of this is that I must learn to accept the things I cannot change. If he wanted to see me, I am not hard to find. If he wanted to be my friend, he knows I am willing. There's no one I have ever loved more, and he knows that.</p><p>Since I don't anticipate seeing him before I leave or at any point in the near future, I find myself looking to the horizon. I'm sick of sitting in this empty place that reminds me of the happiness I once had. I resent the people who ignore my loss and pretend I have not been severely beaten.</p><p>In leaving, I hope to find the ability to put this all behind me like everyone else has. But for now, as I empty my room and surrender this place, I remember.</p><p>And regret.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Shameful</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=24','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Fleetwood Mac - <em>Sara</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
