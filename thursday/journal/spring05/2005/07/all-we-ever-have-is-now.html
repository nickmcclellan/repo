It's not something I found very easy. I think the only way I got through it at all is by not even believing it. I'm going to see her next week, I know it! But I won't. I won't see her for a long while coming.<p>From the moment I met her, I knew she was special. Something's in the name Padmini that screams, &quot;Remember me!&quot; As the legend goes, I did. Me and Padmini&#8212;or The Pad, as she was known as in those days&#8212;became fast friends.</p><p>As wonderful as Junior year was for me, I found that I had really drifted away from people I didn't mean to. Padmini was one of them. Maybe it was the excess of roaches in her apartment or the fact that she only had one Sunday potluck, but I just didn't see her that much. That didn't mean I didn't see her ever, though. Nope, it was I who was there to witness her down her first pint of beer on her 21st Birthday: the stout Guiness, which she didn't end up finishing. And I did get the chance to see her at D.C. Pride. She had such a posh pad and the rats were all sorts of enormous (good thing they were only outside).</p><p>This year Padmini has been one of my best friends. Like some of my other awesome peoples, she really enriched my last two semesters at UGA. Though I may be jealous of her superior English-major brain, I adore her attendence of all the lesser known sausage festivals along with the drunk phone conversations that inevitably follow. Watching <em>Showgirls</em> for the first time would not have had the same kick if our drunk little Padmini wasn't chiming in with comments and outrageous outbursts.</p><p>And let's not forget her fabulous taste in movies that do not star Elizabeth Burkley. She showed me <em>La Mala Educaci&oacute;n</em>, <em>The Aviator</em>, and that wierd movie with the lady who did abortions and liked to drink tea. This summer has been just keen because of <i>Padmini</i>'s constant demand for delicious varieties of ice cream (and, by the way, you really knocked it out of the park with Graham Slam, girl). Oh, urr, or was it me who forced ice cream down our throats :-/</p><p>So yah, I can't say goodbye to movie nights, wine nights, crazy photographs at Jerm's apartment&#8212;it's not possible for me. I feel like I'm going to see her very soon and I'm just going to go with that feeling. I know I'm going to see her tomorrow.</p><p>I just know it. </p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Fabulous</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=59','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">The Flaming Lips - <em>All We Have is Now</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
