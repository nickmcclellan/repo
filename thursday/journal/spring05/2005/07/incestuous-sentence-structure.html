      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/brandypissedicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />It's been a while, so I decided to invoke an oldie.  But a real goodie.<p>I really have wanted to write for a while, but I've had better things to do. This week has been really good, so far. Marilia came back Monday, and oddly enough, that has consumed most of my time this week. I enjoy being with a good friend, who in her own special way, cares about me.</p><p>For example, after some delicious burritos, I had the strong desire for ice cream (what else is new) and so we went to get some. Only thing is, when we got downtown, the most frightening thunder storm started raising hell and I think I screamed alittle. When I opened the door, I swear to God lightning struck right above me.</p><p>Besides various phone interviews, e-mails, and now paper critiques, I have been doing some editing with <em>The Informer</em>. It's been alot of fun, I met this girl Heather who is really nice and very funny. She's a Buffy fan like me, so I tend to throw her a few Glory quotes for her amusement.</p><p>Editing has been a real joy even. I even had one of those &quot;this is what I want to do with my life&quot; moments the other day. I was editing this sentence&#8212;and you have to see this. It went: &quot;Chartered in 1802, Athens-Clarke County and the University of Georgia have grown together to create one of the best college schools in the nation.&quot; It probably sounds better since I recreated it, but there are so many things wrong with it! For one, I don't know if Athens-Clarke County was &quot;chartered in 1802&quot; (I doubt it), but the sentence construction implies that the University was charted along with it (which I know is not true). That's not even the worst part! So the county of Athens and UGA have <em>grown together</em> to <em>create</em> the best party school in the nation? I'm sorry, but does that sound <em>incestuous </em>to anyone else besides me? I feel privileged to know I will be using my valuable editing skills to help rid this world of poor writing and immoral language.</p><p>I also saw <em>War of the Worlds</em> with Kyle on Wednesday. That really freaked me out, it had me paranoid for most of the day. That whole H. G. Wells story invokes one of my darkest fears. Alien invasion stories (at least convincing ones) have always wreaked havoc on my subconscious. I was so glad I watched it early in the afternoon. I missed out on some nasty nightmares.</p><p>This weekend, I think I want to go to Ikea. Since its becoming more and more apparent that I will indeed be moving away from here, I have been thinking about getting stuff. At first, I scoffed at the gays for their strange obsession with Scandinavian furnishings. When I read about the fanatics and their counting down of the days before the Ikea opening in Atlanta, I shuttered. &quot;I wouldn't be caught dead there,&quot; I said to myself. Well, the combined impending joy of moving and my innate sense of gay style have heard the call and I suppose some window shopping with friends would be fun.</p><p>Well, besides running, there's not much else to say. And anyways my foot hurts. I think I'll get my haircut before I see Heather today. It's looking fratish, and that's never good.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Scared</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=50','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">garbage - <em>Silence is Golden</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />

  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
