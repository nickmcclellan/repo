      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="../../05icons/treeinuicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I had a bad day yesterday. I despise things being out of my control&#8212;or more accurately, out of my power. Basically, I missed my first class and was 20 minutes late because the sky decided it wanted to rain today, and so I couldn't take my bike to school with me. Oh, yes, and something mysterious happened to the Number 27 bus yesterday, and it was MIA, and I was standing in the rain for 20 minutes. It was not a good day.<p>Despite that, a few good things happened. I'm going to be published by next week fo sho', I think. It's an excellent profile I wrote on a very worthy Michelle Cohen, in the Health Center. I'd like to get it out Monday because I know it would be a much more effective piece than I'm sure is on the mound for Valentine's Day. She's got a condom purse that is to die for.</p><p>I also went to my first Gamma Sig function of the year. I got to see Jackie and Scotty, and of course Laura. I also met her friend Linda for the second time, and realized the whole connection she has to Justin Parker <em>again</em>, and was really embarrassed when I remembered we had already had that conversion about two years ago. I'm so forgetful. Well, she's still cool, so that's worth something.</p><p>To make up for my Lily-pissed faced, I will share a few things that bring me minimal amounts of joy nowadays. For one, sitting here in the library lounge. Happily, no one has found me here. Also, I really enjoy wasting my money at 'Tween the Pages because they sell The Righteous Juice Co.'s glorious assortment of freshly squeezed fruit juices, including my most favorite, lemonade. I also enjoy their cookies and Baked Lays (but the cookies are old and crumby today&#8212;not like Tuesday's).</p><p>And Monday, I got what I've been sorely lacking for a good six months now. Glasses! I'm so excited about these, I want to wear them at every waking moment. I am barred from such enjoyment on Monday and Wednesday, for weight training reasons. I can't wait for tomorrow though.</p><p>I made a garbage group on facebook. I hope everyone joins. I noticed there are lot of people who have listed garbage in their music interests. They had better equate that into their choice of facebook group. Of course, who else has the connection to all the garbage goodies...like this one!</p><p align="center"><img src="britshirl.jpg" width="297" height="328"></p><p>I think she looks beautiful.  I really hope that Bleed Like Me look makes a splash like Version 2.0.  Anyways, I'm going to be late to class if I don't make haste.</p><p>Adios.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Broccoli</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=9','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Gwen Stefani - <em>What You Waiting For</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<p align="left">Welcome to my last Blog.  As I prepare to graduate, everything is certain to come full circle, and I will do my best to communicate that here.  The ability to comment has been added this time around, so be sure to utilize the joy of interactivity.  If, for some odd reason, you find yourself nostalgic, please visit my journal <a href="http://nicksblog.net/thursday/journal/">Archive Page</a>.<br />
  <br />
  As always, Blogging is dangerous, so don't make an ASS out of U and ME by making any useless assumptions.  If you're coming here because there's something you'd like to know, it's best to talk to me.  After all, this isn't a substitution for conversation, it's an <i>excuse</i></p>
