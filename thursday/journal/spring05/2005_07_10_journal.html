      <div style="clear:both;"></div><img height="100" hspace="5" src="05icons/wdylmshirlicon.jpg" width="100" align="left" />I've put this  off long enough. For this whole summer, I've thought about writing this. Everything I needed to say had been running around in my head so much, the message was crystallized. I knew I was leaving. I knew it was going to be over.  One way or another, I'd be leaving this, Athens, and everything else behind for something different. I so looked forward to writing  this.<p>But this isn't that entry. This is not my absolution. I tell you what, though, I had it all figured out. I had the title, the flow&#8212;everything. But you won't read it here. For some reason, peace and vindication have no place here.</p><p>For the past summer, I have been looking for a job. I have awoken at the crack of dawn at the beginning of every weekday to churn out an ambitious stream of resumes applying to jobs all across the country. I have been filing my talents into envelopes, hoping that someone out there would be impressed enough to give me the lifeline I so desperately need. I knew I would do it, it was only a matter of time. My efforts&#8212;my pains&#8212;would all pay off and I would be afforded an opportunity to leave this place and its darkness behind.</p><p>You see, for quite sometime now I have been very unhappy. I feel trapped. This place feels like a prison to me. Ever since I was deftly hurt  by the person I once considered my best friend, I have wanted to run. Despite trying everything I could and pushing the  limits of my sanity to the breaking point, I had no choice but to concede that resolution in that relationship was out of my control. Unfortunately, I'm very stubborn and faithful. It took months for me to accept the truth, and it wasn't easy.</p><p>I was betrayed and left behind. I even tried to reconcile, but I was still pushed aside. Ever since the beginning of all this, my first instinct was to run. If I had to deal with these circumstances, if I was to fall prey to this harm, why shouldn't I run? What is there here for me to do any longer?</p><p>I hate this place. I hate this state for so many reasons. Alot of it has to do with the election. Alot of it also has to do with this suffocating college campus. I'm sick of walking through my life with a printed schedule in my hand and seeing years for semesters. I hate the drama of Athens and the burden of being a gay man in this place. I don't even enjoy drinking anymore (though you wouldn't be able to tell that from last night).</p><p>I hate that nobody really knows me. I have only a precious few friends that really have some idea of my wishes and desires. I hate that my family can't respect me.</p><p>Maybe I'm bitter, but maybe I deserve to leave. We spend four years in school learning the skills we need to get on in the world, why don't we use them? Why can't I get a job and leave this place behind? What's wrong with wanting to move on in life? This summer, I wanted nothing more than to realize that dream of mine. I wanted to be free.</p><p>It was difficult, though. I didn't have the opportunity to network a job outside of the state. My editor at the Red &amp; Black offered to put in a good word for me for a paper in Augusta, but that wasn't enough. It wasn't far enough. I wanted to go someplace I had never been before. I wanted to go somewhere I wouldn't feel suffocated. I wanted to be someplace that didn't fill me with anxiety, regret, and dread.</p><p>This week, I expected a call from a newspaper in Claremont, New Hampshire. It wasn't a glamorous or exotic place. The paper was small and the town even smaller. But I was still so excited. It was a place I could go, away from here. I couldn't wait for the call&#8212;the job offer. I couldn't bring myself to do anything else but wait.</p><p>But it never came. I don't know why I didn't get the call. You might think it means I didn't get the job, but it's more complicated than that. It's actually still up in the air, I probably could here something next week, but I think it's already too late. I have to admit that my dream of breaking free and getting a job will be postponed.</p><p>So, what does that mean? On one level, it means that this hell I've been living through has won. I can't ever be happy here, even when I'm leaving. It also means I'm just going to have to go someplace else. The only choice is Ohio, with my mother, and try again. I have not looked forward to acknowledging that, but as much as I don't want to go, oddly I kind of want to. I'd only continue there what I've been doing here, only I don't have to be here anymore, this place that I hate. In that sense and only in that sense is this admission a comfort.</p><p>I wanted to tell you I got a job. I wanted to say all my labors came to fruition and I was able to wrestle free, but I cannot. I must, for the moment, resign myself to my defeat and drift away. I used to cry at this sort of disappointment, helpless at the hands of circumstance that I cannot control. I'm not crying though. I don't even think I care.</p><p>Please forgive me. You don't know how  hard it is to have to accept that your happiness is just some foolish fantasy.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Mood</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right">Defeated</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" width="150"><b>Current Music</b></td><td width="1" bgcolor="#fffafa"></td><td width="3"></td><td align="right"><a href="javascript:;" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('radio.blog/?autoplay=53','radioblog','width=222,height=340')">Lauryn Hill - <em>(I Find It Hard To Say) Rebel</em></a></td></tr></tbody></table><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
